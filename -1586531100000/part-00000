P. Balasubrahmanyam]], [[Vadivelu]] and [[Girish Karnad]] in supporting roles. It was the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Indian film]] at the time of release. This film marks the Tamil debut of Nagarjuna.\n\n==Plot==\nAjay ([[Akkineni Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna]]) is an unemployed youth who always gets into trouble because of his temper. He gets heated up when he encounters anyone committing a crime; he takes the law into his own hands, beats them up and then gives them some free advice. Ajay\u2019s father Padmanabhan ([[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]]), who works for an insurance firm, is very unhappy with his son\u2019s attitude, and tries his best to change his attitude through a meditation expert, but fails in this matter as the expert suggests that Ajay's anguish is reasonable. Ajay meets Sonia ([[Sushmita Sen]]) through his father, and she falls in love with him. What Sonia likes about Ajay is his temper and anger when he encounters anything, which is against the law. Sonia gets Padmanabhan's \nhelp to get Ajay to love her. Still, Ajay is not interested in her and seriously rejects her at first; but he later changes his mind after going through some unusual situations, and love blossoms between them.\n\nSonia\u2019s father Sriram ([[Girish Karnad]]) is an industrialist who owns the [[Daewoo]] automotive manufacturing facility. He has no objection to his daughter\u2019s relationship with Ajay, but has one condition: Ajay must become employed in his factory, control his temper for three months, and not get into any fight whatsoever, even if he encounters a crime happening in front of his eyes. If Ajay cannot do this, he will not be allowed to marry Sonia. With a heavy heart, Ajay agrees to the condition; Sonia's love for Ajay deepens and Sriram offers Ajay a job in his factory. Sriram actually has his own problems with his factory in a loss; ten of his workers are working with his rival and younger stepbrother Gnaneswar ([[Raghuvaran]]), and they hamper the progress of his factory with frequent, pre-planned mishaps. This leads to the factory's property loss.\n\nGnaneswar is the son of Sriram's stepmother, who gets deceived by Sriram and loses his share of his father's common business empire. Further, in unusual circumstances, Gnaneswar spends some years in jail and returns with a planned conspiracy and vengeance on his stepbrother Sriram. Gnaneswar is now trying to put Sriram out of business, so his ten men create havoc in the factory by killing old ''workers'' and raging new workers. So when Ajay comes to work in Sriram\u2019s factory, these ten men do the same to Ajay. Ajay keeps cool, trying to keep his promise to Sriram. But Sriram hopes otherwise; he wants Ajay to break the promise and beat up the ten men and throw them out of the factory. At the same time, Sriram hopes the imminent marriage between Ajay and Sonia will be canceled, since he does not want his daughter to marry an angry street0fighter like Ajay. So Sriram keeps hoping Ajay will somehow burst out. Gnaneswar's men damage an important machine to make the international Korean experts attend the problem. The plan is to kill those Korean experts so that it would become an international issue and Sriram's company would be locked out permanently, but Ajay saves those experts, and Sriram publicizes this to create a fight between Gnaneswar's men and Ajay, but it happens otherwise that Ajay still keeps cool in spite of them beating him black and blue, and Sriram's hopes are devastated. As a last trigger, Sriram uses his father's name in publicizing the issue in factory to media so that Gnaneswar's men may think that it was Ajay's father who brought this to the media. As expected by Sriram, those ten men brutally murder Ajay's father for this.\n\nAfter this, Ajay becomes furious and breaks his promise and banishes the ten men from the factory. But Gnaneswar holds Ajay and blackmails Sonia that he would kill Ajay unless Sonia kills herself by destroying Sriram's factory by bombarding it with a truck armed with a powerful Russian explosive. In the climax, Gnaneswar kills Sriram by throwing him off the helicopter; Gnaneswar gets killed when his helicopter hits the mountains; and Sonia gets saved and unites with Ajay.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Akkineni Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna]] as Ajay Padmanabhan\n* [[Sushmita Sen]] as Sonia Sriram\n* [[S.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was nominated for a full term. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]] was nominated for vice president.\n\nThe convention took place less than a year after President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. On the last day of the convention, Kennedy's brother [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] introduced a short film in honor of his brother's memory. After Kennedy appeared on the convention floor, delegates erupted in 22 minutes of uninterrupted applause, causing him to nearly break into tears. Speaking about his brother's vision for the country, Robert Kennedy quoted from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'': \"When he shall die, take him and cut him out into the stars, and he shall make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.\" The Keynote speech was then delivered by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], of Rhode Island, where he spoke passionately of the party's success and in remembrance of President Kennedy. Pastore was later featured on the cover of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[LIFE (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine for the success of the address. \n[[Adlai E. Stevenson II]], [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] and twice a Democratic nominee for President, received a short, but polite ovation before introducing a memorial film the same day for former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who had died on November 7, 1962. By August 26, 1964, 14,000 retirees from the [[Alliance for Retired Americans|N. C. S. C. (National Council Of Senior Citizens)]] arrived at the Convention, to encourage President Johnson to extend public health insurance to millions of Americans. In July 1965, Medicare was signed into law in front of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], whose push for N. H. I. ([[National health insurance|National Health Insurance]]) had collapsed, nearly two decades earlier.\n\n==Mississippi controversy==\n{{see also|Fannie Lou Hamer}}<!--Until she can be integrated-->\n{{see also|Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party}}\n[[File:1964 DNC day 1 (a).jpg|thumb|left|Convention floor]]\nAt the national convention the integrated [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) claimed the seats for delegates for Mississippi, on the grounds that the official Mississippi delegation had been elected in violation of the party's rules because blacks had been systematically excluded from voting in the primaries, and participating in the precinct and county caucuses and the state convention; whereas the MFDP delegates had all been elected in strict compliance with party rules. The MFDP prepared a legal brief detailing the reasons why the \"regular\" Mississippi delegation did not adequately represent their state's residents, including the tactics employed to exclude participation by Black citizens. [[Jack Minnis]] wrote, \"MFDP, with the help of SNCC, produced brochures, mimeographed biographies of the MFDP delegates, histories of the MFDP, legal arguments, historical arguments, moral arguments\" that were distributed to all of the Convention's delegates.<ref>Carmichael, Stokely, and Charles V. Hamilton. Black Power: The Politics of Liberation, (New York: Random House, 1967), p. 90.</ref> The party's liberal leaders, led by Congresswoman [[Edith Green]]<ref>Carmichael and Hamilton p.92.</ref> supported an even division of the seats between the two delegations. But Johnson was concerned that, while the regular Democrats of Mississippi would probably vote for Goldwater anyway, rejecting them would lose him the South. Eventually, [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and the black civil rights leaders including [[Roy Wilkins]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] worked out a compromise: two of the 68 MFDP delegates chosen by Johnson would be made at-large delegates and the remainder would be non-voting guests of the convention; the regular Mississippi delegation was required to pledge to support the party ticket; and no future Democratic convention would accept a delegation chosen by a discriminatory poll.\n\n[[Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.|Joseph Rauh]], the MFDP's lawyer, initially refused this deal, but eventually urged the MFDP to accept it. But the MFDP delegates refused because by accepting the official all-white Mississippi delegation, the party validated a process in which blacks had been denied their constitutional right to vote and participate in the political process. They felt that because the MFDP had conducted their delegate selection process according to the party rules, they should be seated as the Mississippi delegation, not just a token two of them as at-large delegates. Many civil rights activists were deeply offended by the convention's outcome. As leader (and now Representative) [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] said, \"We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Lewis\n  | first = John\n  | title = Walking With the Wind \n  | url = https://archive.org/details/walkingwithwindm00lewi\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Simon & Schuster \n  | year = 1998}}</ref>\n\nMany white delegates from Mississippi and Alabama refused to sign any pledge, and left the convention.<ref>Unger and Unger, ''LBJ; a Life'' (1999) pp. 325-6; Dallek, ''Flawed Giant: Lyndon B.

The [[Favorite son|favorite son candidates]] who had run in his place then withdrew, his name was the only one placed in nomination, and for the last time, the presidential roll-call vote was dispensed with.

It had been rumored that the President was going to choose his predecessor's brother-in-law [[Sargent Shriver]] but that [[Robert F. Kennedy]] had nixed this idea, claiming that he wasn't a real Kennedy and it would be impolitic to choose him. The Attorney General made it known that he deserved the second spot instead, but then President Johnson announced that sitting Cabinet members would not be under consideration.\n\nSpeculation centered on Senate Majority Whip [[Hubert H. Humphrey]], a perennial candidate who had run either one of the two spots in every election since 1952, and was a champion of civil rights. On the second day of the convention, LBJ invited Humphrey and Connecticut Senator [[Thomas J. Dodd|Thomas Dodd]] to the White House for an extended job interview. After a long wait, the President announced that his choice was Humphrey, who was nominated by voice vote the following day.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1964 Republican National Convention]]\n* [[1964 United States presidential election]]\n* [[History of the United States Democratic Party]]\n* [[List of Democratic National Conventions]]\n* [[U.S. presidential nomination convention]]\n* [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1964]]\n* [[Southern strategy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29603 Democratic Party Platform of 1964] at ''The American Presidency Project''\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=26467 Johnson Nomination Acceptance Speech for President at DNC] (transcript) at ''The American Presidency Project''\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbuSZTfLubY Video of Johnson nomination acceptance speech for President at DNC (via YouTube)]\n* [http://convert2mp3.net/en/index.php?p=tags&id=youtube_xbuSZTfLubY&key=sjEYssRCGlbV Audio of Johnson nomination acceptance speech for President at DNC]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBBCQDVSEAk Video of Humphrey nomination acceptance speech for Vice President at DNC (via YouTube)]\n* [http://convert2mp3.net/en/index.php?p=tags&id=youtube_HBBCQDVSEAk&key=6CFhtO9cxTnx Audio of Humphrey nomination acceptance speech for Vice President at DNC]\n* [http://www.speeches-usa.com/Transcripts/hubert_humphrey-1964dnc.html Transcript of Humphrey nomination acceptance speech for Vice President at DNC]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW0_npkgG_M&t=4m16s Johnny Carson (in earliest known preserved color video monologue) DNC jokes, 24 August 1964]\n* [https://www.thenation.com/article/how-medicare-was-won/ How 14,000 retirees fought for Medicare and won, within a year.]\n\n{{sequence|\n prev=[[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]]<br>[[Los Angeles, California]]|\n list=[[Democratic National Convention]]s|\n next=[[1968 Democratic National Convention|1968]]<br>[[Chicago, Illinois]]|\n}}\n{{Democratic National Convention}}\n{{Lyndon B.

Rauh, Jr.|Joseph Rauh]], the MFDP's lawyer, initially refused this deal, but eventually urged the MFDP to accept it. But the MFDP delegates refused because by accepting the official all-white Mississippi delegation, the party validated a process in which blacks had been denied their constitutional right to vote and participate in the political process. They felt that because the MFDP had conducted their delegate selection process according to the party rules, they should be seated as the Mississippi delegation, not just a token two of them as at-large delegates. Many civil rights activists were deeply offended by the convention's outcome. As leader (and now Representative) [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] said, \"We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.\"<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Lewis\n  | first = John\n  | title = Walking With the Wind \n  | url = https://archive.org/details/walkingwithwindm00lewi\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Simon & Schuster \n  | year = 1998}}</ref>\n\nMany white delegates from Mississippi and Alabama refused to sign any pledge, and left the convention.<ref>Unger and Unger, ''LBJ; a Life'' (1999) pp. 325-6; Dallek, ''Flawed Giant: Lyndon B.

It had been rumored that the President was going to choose his predecessor's brother-in-law [[Sargent Shriver]] but that [[Robert F. Kennedy]] had nixed this idea, claiming that he wasn't a real Kennedy and it would be impolitic to choose him. The Attorney General made it known that he deserved the second spot instead, but then President Johnson announced that sitting Cabinet members would not be under consideration.\n\nSpeculation centered on Senate Majority Whip [[Hubert H. Humphrey]], a perennial candidate who had run either one of the two spots in every election since 1952, and was a champion of civil rights. On the second day of the convention, LBJ invited Humphrey and Connecticut Senator [[Thomas J. Dodd|Thomas Dodd]] to the White House for an extended job interview. After a long wait, the President announced that his choice was Humphrey, who was nominated by voice vote the following day.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1964 Republican National Convention]]\n* [[1964 United States presidential election]]\n* [[History of the United States Democratic Party]]\n* [[List of Democratic National Conventions]]\n* [[U.S. presidential nomination convention]]\n* [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1964]]\n* [[Southern strategy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29603 Democratic Party Platform of 1964] at ''The American Presidency Project''\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=26467 Johnson Nomination Acceptance Speech for President at DNC] (transcript) at ''The American Presidency Project''\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbuSZTfLubY Video of Johnson nomination acceptance speech for President at DNC (via YouTube)]\n* [http://convert2mp3.net/en/index.php?p=tags&id=youtube_xbuSZTfLubY&key=sjEYssRCGlbV Audio of Johnson nomination acceptance speech for President at DNC]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBBCQDVSEAk Video of Humphrey nomination acceptance speech for Vice President at DNC (via YouTube)]\n* [http://convert2mp3.net/en/index.php?p=tags&id=youtube_HBBCQDVSEAk&key=6CFhtO9cxTnx Audio of Humphrey nomination acceptance speech for Vice President at DNC]\n* [http://www.speeches-usa.com/Transcripts/hubert_humphrey-1964dnc.html Transcript of Humphrey nomination acceptance speech for Vice President at DNC]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW0_npkgG_M&t=4m16s Johnny Carson (in earliest known preserved color video monologue) DNC jokes, 24 August 1964]\n* [https://www.thenation.com/article/how-medicare-was-won/ How 14,000 retirees fought for Medicare and won, within a year.]\n\n{{sequence|\n prev=[[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]]<br>[[Los Angeles, California]]|\n list=[[Democratic National Convention]]s|\n next=[[1968 Democratic National Convention|1968]]<br>[[Chicago, Illinois]]|\n}}\n{{Democratic National Convention}}\n{{Lyndon B.

Despite being lavishly praised at the beginning of his career in the [[1920s]], Campbell's subsequent conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]] and his poetic attacks against [[The Bloomsbury Group]], [[Sigmund Freud]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[Second Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], caused him to become a polarising figure during his lifetime. Despite Campbell's attacks against [[racism]] in his native South Africa and his angry rejection of [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]'s efforts to recruit him into the [[British Union of Fascists]], Campbell continues to be labeled a [[fascist]] and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.\n\nAccording to [[Roger Scruton]], \"Campbell wrote vigorous rhyming [[pentameter]]s, into which he instilled the most prodigious array of images and the most intoxicating draft of life of any poet of the [[20th century]]...He was also a [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling adventurer]] and a dreamer of dreams. And his life and writings contain so many lessons about the British experience in the 20th century that it is worth revisiting them.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Scruton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2009/10/12/a-dark-horse/print |title=A Dark Horse |publisher=spectator.org |date=October 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\n==Family Origins==\nAccording to Campbell, his paternal ancestors were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Covenanters]] and members of [[Clan Campbell]], who left [[Scotland]] after the defeat of the [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] by the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] in 1645 and settled as part of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in [[Carndonagh]], in [[Inishowen]],  [[County Donegal]].<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 4\">Pearce (2004), page 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the centuries when they lived in Donegal, the [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] ancestors of the poet were small farmers. Many of the men were talented [[Irish fiddle|fiddlers]]. According to the family's oral tradition, the living standards of the Campbell family improved drastically around 1750, when one of the poet's ancestors eloped with the daughter of Carndonagh's [[Anglo-Irish]] landlord.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 4-5.</ref>\n\nThe poet's grandfather, William Campbell, set sail for the [[Colony of Natal]] with his family aboard the [[brigantine]] ''Conquering Hero'' from [[Glasgow]] in 1850. When they arrived, there was little sign of the city of [[Durban]], which would become the greatest port city in Southern Africa, except a fortress and a few mud huts. However, William Campbell adapted well to life in [[Africa]] and built the breakwater that still forms the foundation of the great North Pier in Durban harbor. He also built a large and very successful [[sugar cane]] plantation.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 2-3.</ref>\n\nThe poet's father, Samuel George Campbell, was born in Durban in 1861. In 1878 he traveled to [[Edinburgh]] to study medicine and won prizes for surgery, clinical surgery, and [[botany]]. He graduated with honors in 1882 and completed postgraduate work at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]]. He also studied ear, nose and throat ailments in [[Vienna]]. In 1886, he returned to Scotland to take his [[M.D.]] and to become a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]. While in Scotland, Dr. Campbell married Margaret Wylie Dunnachie, daughter of James Dunnachie, of [[Glenboig]], [[Lanarkshire]], a wealthy self-made businessman, and Jean Hendry of [[Eaglesham]].<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 4\"/><ref name=\"dictionary\">[[The Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref>\n\nAccording to the poet, his Dunnachie ancestors were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] who fled [[Scotland]] after the [[Jacobite Uprising of 1745]], but returned after the [[Act of Indemnity 1747|act of indemnity]].<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 4\"/>\n\nAlso according to the poet, his maternal grandfather, James Dunnachie, was an acquaintance of [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred Tennyson]], and also corresponded for many years with [[Mark Twain]].<ref>Pearce (2004), page 5.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, Doctor and Mrs. Campbell moved back to Natal, where he established a very successful medical practice. He would often travel long distances on foot to treat his patients and, in an unprejudiced approach deeply rare in Colonial South Africa, would treat both black and white patients. His generosity to patients who could not afford to pay was also legendary. For this reason, \"Sam Joj\", as he was called, was deeply loved by the [[Zulu people]] of Natal.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 5-6.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nRoy Campbell the third son of Dr. Samuel and Margaret Campbell, was born in [[Durban]], [[Colony of Natal]], on October 2, 1901. At the time of his birth, the [[Second Boer War]] was still being fought and Roy's father was on [[active service]] as a [[Major]] with the Natal Volunteer Medical Corps. For this was reason, it was several days before Maj. Campbell learned of the birth of his son. In a [[Uniting Presbyterian Church in Southern Africa|Presbyterian]] ceremony, the baby was [[baptism|christened]] Royston Dunnachie Campbell after an uncle by marriage.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 6.</ref>\n\nRoy later said that his first memory was of a day when his [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nurse maid, Catherine Mgadi, wheeled him further than usual on their morning outing. The hedge they had been skirting suddenly stopped and they came across an empty, railed in site overlooking the [[Indian Ocean]], which a fascinated Roy glimpsed through the legs of a [[horse]]. Sensing Roy's fascination, Catherine told him that the Indian Ocean was \"''Lwandhla''\", the word for the sea in the [[Zulu language]]. Roy later recalled, \"''Lwandhla'', which in two-syllables, [[Homeric]]ally expressed the pride and glory of the ocean and the plunge of its breakers, struck my mind with a force which no other word or line in prose or poetry has ever had for me since. I went on repeating the word ''lwandhla'' for days. It was the first word I remember ''learning''.\" In later years, both horses and the sea would be regular themes in Campbell's poetry.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 1-2.</ref>\n\nAnother figure who greatly influenced the poet's youth was Dooglie, a Highlander whom Doctor Campbell had met in Scotland and brought back with him to Natal. In Durban, Dooglie taught the Doctor's sons both the [[Great Highland bagpipe|Highland bagpipes]] and [[Highland dancing]]. Roy's elder brothers, Archie and George, were soon so adept at both that they won medals in the junior category during competitions organized by the local Caledonian Society.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 2.</ref> Roy later wrote, \"From those times onwards, till recently, I always believed we were pure Scotch Highlanders by descent. I only discovered our [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[French people|French]] ancestry by accident.\"<ref>Roy Campbell (1951),''Light on a Dark Horse'', Hollis & Carter, London. Page 30.</ref>\n\nWhenever Dooglie played the [[bagpipes]], the Campbell's neighbor, an immigrant from the [[German Empire]], always reacted with outrage. The poet later wrote: <blockquote>To the compatriot of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Bach]], living on the other side of the [[corrugated iron]] fence which separated our two gardens, with his more exalted ideas of music, the braying of the bagpipes (or 'pack-vives' as he called them) was an insult and a nightmare. So whenever the 'pack-vives' started up from our side of the fence, Herr Kruger, in sheer self defense, would line up his entire staff of some dozen native servants, arm them with bricks, and get them to pound and hammer on the fence, and to yell with all their might, while two [[Indians in South Africa|Indian waiters]] hammered on [[brass]] trays, as if they were trying to scare away a swarm of [[locust]]s. Then we would see Herr Kruger himself...waving his arms in paroxysms of fury, like the conductor of some infernal [[orchestra]]: and screeching and howling, as loud as the pipes themselves: \"Harriple pack-vives! Harriple pack-vives! Ha-a-a-riple pack-vives!\"<ref>Campbell (1951), page 30.</ref></blockquote>Dooglie invariably responded to Herr Kruger's objections by playing his bagpipes even louder, until all the dogs, donkeys, horses, and cattle in the neighborhood caught on to the excitement and added their own voices to the cacophony.<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 7\">Pearce (2004), page 7.</ref>\n\nAt first, Roy and Catherine would react to these noisy disputes by cowering under the bed. In times however, they would experience, \"a sort of awed, bewildered exhilaration... and would run round in circles, leaping, jumping, pulling faces, waving our arms like Herr Kruger, and imitating the noises of the pipes, the natives, and the Herr, indiscriminately, by turns.\"<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 7\"/>\n\nAfter the birth of his younger brother Neil, Roy was increasingly left in the care of his Zulu nurse and he would later recall, \"I got a good many of my ideas from Catherine.<ref>Campbell (1951), page 46.</ref>\n\nAccording to Joseph Pearce: <blockquote>This cross-current of cultural influences, the flow of Gaelic tradition interacting with the perceptions of a Zulu child, colored Roy Campbell's formative years. It produced a cultural hybrid, an Afro-[[Celts (modern)|Celtic]], which was itself a by-product of [[Colonialism]]. Thus Roy and his brother's were dressed for church in Eton collars on Sunday and in [[kilt]]s the next, but also, in accordance with African custom, they shot their first buck at the age of eight. Similarly, they learned [[Border ballads|Scots ballads]] from their parents and [[African folklore]] from the natives. At the very moment that Roy was discovering the delights of the [[English language]] in verse, he was also learning the [[Zulu language]] through his conversations with Catherine.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 7-8.</ref></blockquote>Campbell also played regularly with boys from among the [[Zulu people]]. He later wrote: <blockquote>The Zulus are a highly intellectual people. They have a very beautiful language, a little on the bombastic side and highly adorned. Its effect on me can be seen in ''The Flaming Terrapin''. Above all, the Zulu are great hableurs and boasters; the one thing they love is conversation. It is the only art they have, but it is a very great art... They take enormous delight in conversation, analyzing with the greatest subtlety and brilliance. Only our really great conversationalists equal them. They are full of [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]]-like [[proverb]]s and optimistic wisdom. And they have extremely sunny temperaments.<ref>Roy Campbell (1934), ''Broken Record'', page 59.</ref></blockquote>His daughter, Teresa Campbell, also recalled: <blockquote>My father was born and bred among the natives of South Africa. He got to love their wisdom and integrity. He respected them tremendously - to him they became as brothers. He spent all his happy childhood years with them and learnt a lot about life from this close association. It was this deep sharing of life with him that gave him his clear insight to the [[Apartheid|South African problem]]. We were always surprised at the uncommon ease with which he could mix with any company - with peasants and fishermen. This, my mother said, came from his early mixing with the native Africans.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 10.</ref></blockquote>In later years, Roy Campbell's empathy for the plight of the [[Zulu people]] under rule by [[White South Africans]] expressed itself in his [[sonnet]]s ''The Zulu Girl'',<ref>Roy Campbell (2001), ''Selected Poems'', Edited and Introduced by Joseph Pearce. Pages 6-7.</ref> ''The Serf'',\n<ref>Campbell (2001), page 5.</ref> and in his [[literary translation]] of a ''Zulu Song''.<ref>Campbell (2001), page 6.</ref>\n\n===Teenager===\nEducated at [[Durban High School]], Campbell counted [[literature]] and the outdoor life among his first loves. He was an accomplished [[Equestrianism|horseman]] and [[fisherman]].\n\nCampbell left the [[Union of South Africa]] in December 1918 for [[Oxford University]], where he arrived early in 1919. Roy, who considered himself a Celt, had already conceived an intense hatred of \"Anglo-Saxondom\" and the [[British Empire]]. Therefore, despite his descent from Orangemen, in letters to his parents, Roy expressed admiration and support for both [[Sinn Fein]] and the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|IRA]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]].<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 37-38.</ref>\n\nHowever, he failed the entrance examination.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 26, 33\u201334</ref> Reporting this to his father, he took a philosophical stance, telling him that \"university lectures interfere very much with my work,\" which was writing poetry.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> His verse writing was stimulated by avid readings of [[Nietzsche]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and the English [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan]] and [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poets. Among his early fruitful contacts were [[C.S. Lewis]], [[William Walton]], [[the Sitwells]], and [[Wyndham Lewis]].<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> Campbell wrote verse imitations of [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]. He also began to drink heavily, and continued to do so for the rest of his life.\n\nCampbell left Oxford for London in 1920. Holidays spent in wandering through [[France]] and along the Mediterranean coast alternated with periods in London's [[Bohemianism|literary bohemia]]. In 1922, he married without parental consent and forfeited, for a time, his generous parental allowance.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> His wife was Lady [[Mary Garman|Mary Margaret Garman]], eldest of the [[Garman Sisters|Garman sisters]]. They had two daughters, Teresa (Tess) and Anna.\n\n==Poet and satirist==\nWhile living in a small converted stable on the coast of [[North Wales]], Campbell completed his first long poem, ''The Flaming Terrapin'', a [[humanistic]] [[allegory]] of the rejuvenation of man projected in episodes. It was published in 1924.\n\n''The Flaming Terrapin'' had established his reputation as a rising star and was favourably compared to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s recently released poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''.  His verse was well-received by Eliot himself, [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Edith Sitwell]], and many others.\n\n==''Voorslag''==\nReturning to South Africa with Mary in 1925, Campbell started ''[[Voorslag]]'', a literary magazine with the ambition to serve as a \"whiplash\" (the meaning of the title in [[Afrikaans]]) on South African colonial society, which he considered \"bovine\". Before the magazine was launched, Campbell invited [[William Plomer]] to help with it, and late in the year, [[Laurens van der Post]] was invited to become the magazine's [[Afrikaans]] editor. ''Voorslag'' was, according to Joseph Pearce, one of the first [[bilingual]] literary journals ever published in South Africa.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 82.</ref>\n\nThe first issue included a [[book review]] in which Campbell praised Plomer's recent novel ''Turbott Wolfe''. The novel depicted a White artist filling his studio with Black women as his models and sexual partners, much to the outrage of the artist's [[racist]] White neighbors. Plomer courted further controversy by ending his novel with an [[interracial marriage]] between a Black man and a White woman. For these reasons, Plomer's ''Turbott Wolfe'' had been dubbed, \"A Nasty Book on a Nasty Subject,\" by the ''[[Natal Advertiser]]''.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 82-83.</ref>\n\nIn his review for ''Voorslag'', Campbell praised ''Turbott Wolfe'' as \"just and true\", but also criticized Plomer for [[dehumanisation|dehumanizing]] the White racists in his novel. Campbell wrote: <blockquote>Mr. Plomer has shown his white characters when acting under the influence of race-feeling, behaving with typical ferocity and injustice. But he fails to let them relax enough into their individual and comparative dignity. He keeps pointing at them all the time and nudging the reader. I have known many farmers who capable of the most callous and criminal behaviour to the blacks, were guilless sons of the soil, as innocent as sleeping babes, with devout souls and sky-blue eyes. Their cruelty and impulsiveness was not even remembered when they relapsed again into their individual rationality. This type is much more normal than the bloodthirsty type described by Mr. Plomer and it confronts one with a far more terrible enigma. If Mr. Plomer had realized this his [[satire]] would have been more devastatingly complete and he might have achieved a masterpiece.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 83.</ref></blockquote>Elsewhere in the same issue, Campbell \"attacked Colonial South Africa with unrestrained venom\". He wrote that the White man's [[racial superiority]] was \"a [[superstition]] which was exploded by science ten years ago and by [[Christianity]] two thousand years before.\" As a nation, he wrote that South Africa lagged \"three hundred years behind modern [[Europe]] and five hundred years behind modern art and science.\" Furthermore, he accused [[White South Africans]] of being little more than a nation of [[parasites]]. Campbell concluded: <blockquote>We have no excuse for our [[parasitism]] on the native and the sooner we realize it the safer for our future. We are as a race without thinkers, without leaders, without even a physical [[aristocracy]] working on the land. The study of modern [[anthropology]] should be encouraged as it would give us a better sense of our position in the [[family tree]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' - which is among the lower branches: it might even rouse us to assert ourselves in some less ignoble way than reclining blissfully in a grocer's paradise and feeding on the labour of the natives.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 83-84.</ref></blockquote>Both ''Voorslag'' articles outraged the White population of [[Natal, South Africa (disambiguation)|Natal]]. In response, the magazine's owner, Lewis Reynolds, informed Campbell that, in the future, his editorial control over ''Voorslag'' was going to be drastically limited. Campbell resigned in protest.\n\nTo his grief and horror, Campbell found himself subjected to social [[ostracism]] by the Whites of Durban and found that even members of his own family wanted nothing to do with him. Left destitute, Campbell wrote to his friend C.J. Sibbett, a wealthy [[Cape Town]] advertising executive, and asked for a gift of \u00a350, so that he and his family could return to England. Campbell concluded, \"None of my relations will look at me because of the opinions I have expressed in ''Voorslag''.\"<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 81\u201385, 92-93.</ref>\n\nSibbett, who immediately sent Campbell the money, wrote to the editor of the ''[[Natal Witness]]'', \"I am very glad to hear where your sympathies lie in the ''Voorslag'' controversy. Roy and Plomer were like [[thoroughbred]]s pitted against pack-[[mule]]s. Natal seems to me to be [[Wesleyan]]-ridden with a strong dash of [[Calvinism]] thrown in and it is astonishing how these two Cuckoo eggs came to be hatched there.\"<ref>Pearce (2004), page 95.</ref>\n\nBefore leaving South Africa with his family in 1927, Campbell reacted to his ostracism by writing the poem ''The Making of a Poet'', which compares himself to \"some restive steer', who \"keeps the wolf at bay\" from the cattle herd that has cast out and rejected him.<ref>Roy Campbell (1955), ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], [[Chicago]]. Pages 27-28.</ref> Campbell also wrote ''Tristan da Cunha'',<ref>Campbell (1955), pages 40-43.</ref> and ''The Wayzgoose'', a lampoon, in [[heroic couplets]], on the [[racism]] and other cultural shortcomings of Colonial South Africa. The poem included belligerent attacks against those who Campbell felt had wronged him in the controversy over ''Voorslag''. ''The Wayzgoose'' was published in 1928.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/><ref>Roy Campbell, ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], 1955. Pages 243\u2013268.</ref>\n\nIn a 1956 letter to [[Harvey Brit]], who had accused Campbell of being a [[Fascist]], the latter wrote, \"I am an exile...from my country because I stood up for fair play for the blacks - is that [[Fascism]]?\"<ref>Pearce (2004), page 423.</ref>\n\n==Bloomsbury==\nHaving returned to London, Campbell began to move in literary circles. Though initially on friendly terms with the [[Bloomsbury Group]], the poet subsequently became very hostile to them, declaring that they were sexually [[promiscuous]], [[snobbish]], and [[anti-Christian]].\n\nAccording to [[Roger Scruton]], <blockquote>Learning that his wife had been conducting a passionate affair with [[Vita Sackville-West|Vita]] (to the enraged jealousy of Vita\u2019s other lover, [[Virginia Woolf]]), Campbell began to see the three aspects of the new elite\u2014sexual inversion, anti-patriotism, and progressive politics\u2014as aspects of a single frame of mind. These three qualities amounted, for Campbell, to a refusal to grow up. The new elite, in Campbell\u2019s opinion, lived as bloodless parasites on their social inferiors and moral betters; they jettisoned real responsibilities in favor of utopian fantasies and flattered themselves that their precious sensibilities were signs of moral refinement, rather than the marks of a fastidious [[narcissism]]. The role of the poet is not to join their [[Peter Pan]] games but to look beneath such frolics for the source of spiritual renewal.<ref>[[American Spectator]], October 2009. [http://spectator.org/archives/2009/10/12/a-dark-horse/]</ref></blockquote>\n\nReferring to the Bloomsbury Group as \"intellectuals without intellect\", Campbell penned a verse satire of them entitled ''The Georgiad'' (1931). According to [[Joseph Pearce]], <blockquote>As with so much of Campbell's satire, ''The Georgiad's'' invective is too vindictive. It is all too often spoiled by spite. This underlying weakness has obscured the more serious points its author sought to make. Embedded between the attacks on [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Marie Stopes]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and a host of other Bloomsbury's and Georgians are classically refined objections to the prevailing philosophy of scepticism, mounted like pearls of wisdom in the basest of metal. \"Nor knew the Greeks, save in the laughing page, The philosophic emblem of our age.\"... The \"damp philosophy\" of the modern world, as espoused by the archetypical modern poet, was responsible for the prevailing pessimism and disillusionment of the post-war world. In preaching such a philosophy, which was \"the fountain source of all his woes\", the poet's \"damp philosophy\" left him \"damp in spirit\". [[Nihilism]] was self-negating. It was the philosophy of the self-inflicted wound. In the rejection of post-war pessimism and its nihilistic ramifications... Campbell was uniting himself with others, such as [[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]], who were similarly seeking glimmers of philosophical light amidst the prevailing gloom. In his case, as in theirs, the philosophical search would lead him to orthodox [[Christianity]].<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Roy Campbell; Selected Poems'', [[Saint Austin Press]], 2001. Page xx.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Campbells moved to [[Provence]] in the early 1930s.\n\nThe French period saw the publication of, among other writings, ''Adamastor'' (1930), ''Poems'' (1930), ''The Georgiad'' (1931), and the first version of his autobiography, ''Broken Record'' (1934). In 1932, the Campbells retained the [[Afrikaner]] poet [[Uys Krige]] as tutor to Tess and Anna.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 195</ref> During this time he and his wife Mary were slowly being drawn to the [[Catholic|Roman Catholic]] faith, a process which can be traced in a sonnet sequence entitled ''[[Mithraism|Mithraic]] Emblems'' (1936).\n\nA fictionalized version of Campbell at this time (\"Rob McPhail\") appears in the novel ''Snooty Baronet'' by Wyndham Lewis (1932). Campbell's poetry had been published in Lewis' periodical ''[[Blast (journal)|BLAST]]''; he was reportedly happy to appear in the novel but disappointed that his character was killed off (McPhail was gored while fighting a bull).\n\n==Move to Spain==\nIn the autumn of 1933, Tess's goat broke through a neighbour's fence and in the course of a night destroyed a number of young peach trees. The neighbour demanded compensation, which Campbell felt unable to pay. The neighbour then successfully sued for a considerable sum. Campbell still saw no way to pay the indemnity and faced the prospect of imprisonment. He and his wife escaped the authorities by surreptitiously escaping across the border into Spain. They traveled by train to [[Barcelona]], where they were joined a few days later by their children, Uys Krige, the children's French governess, their dog Sarah, and whatever luggage they could carry between them.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\nThe family settled in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. They were formally received into the Catholic Church in the small Spanish village of [[Altea]] in 1935. The English author [[Laurie Lee]] recounts meeting Campbell in the Toledo chapter of ''[[As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning]]'', the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy.\n\nAccording to [[Joseph Pearce]], <blockquote>\"In March 1936 the anti-clerical contagion spreading across Spain reached the streets of Toledo, the ancient city in which the Campbells had made their home. Churches were burned in a series of violent riots in which priests and nuns were attacked. During these bloody disturbances, Roy and Mary Campbell sheltered in their house several of the [[Carmelite]] monks from the neighboring monastery. In the following weeks, the situation worsened. Portraits of [[Marx]] and [[Lenin]] were posted on every street corner, and horrific tales began to filter in from surrounding villages of priests being shot and wealthy men being butchered in front of their families. Toledo's beleaguered Christians braced themselves for the next wave of persecution, and the Campbells, in an atmosphere that must have seemed eerily reminiscent of early Christians in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], were confirmed in a secret ceremony, before dawn, by Cardinal Goma, the elderly Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain. In July 1936, the civil war erupted onto the streets of Toledo, heralded by the arrival in the city of Communist militiamen from [[Madrid]]. With no one to defend them, the priests, monks, and nuns fell prey to the hatred of their adversaries. The seventeen monks from the Carmelite monastery were rounded up, herded on to the street and shot. Campbell discovered their murdered bodies, left lying where they fell. He also discovered the bodies of other priests lying in the narrow street where the priests had been murdered. Swarms of flies surrounded their bodies, and scrawled in their blood on the wall was written, 'Thus strikes the [[CHEKA]].'\"<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', [[Ignatius Press]], 2001. Pages 196\u2013197.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCampbell later immortalized the incident in his poem ''The Carmelites of Toledo''.<ref>''Roy Campbell; Selected Poems'', [[Saint Austin Press]], 2001. Edited by Joseph Pearce. pp. 52\u201360.</ref>\n\n==England again==\nOn  9 August 1936, the Campbells boarded HMS ''Maine'', which was evacuating British subjects to Marseilles.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 247</ref> Within weeks, they were back in England. After the atrocities he had witnessed, Campbell was deeply offended by the generally pro-Republican sympathies in Britain, where large numbers of young men were volunteering for the [[International Brigades]] and where only British Catholics raised a dissident voice.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 249-260.</ref>\n\nWhile staying with his openly [[Stalinist]] in-laws at [[Binstead]],<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 259-260.</ref> Campbell found himself being courted by the [[British Union of Fascists]]. In the fall of 1936, [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]] arranged a meeting between Campbell and BUF leader [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. Campbell later recalled of the meeting, \"I not only refused Mosley's and Lewis's offer of a very high position and lucrative position in the Fascist party but explained that I was returning to the ranks to fight [[Marxist-Leninism|Red Fascism]], the worst and most virulent variety, and that when the time came I was ready to fight [[Nazi Germany|Brown]] or [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Black Fascism]] and that I could (though badly disabled) knock both of their brains out there and then! I explained that I was only fighting as a [[Christians|Christian]] for [[religious freedom|the right to pray]] in my own churches, all of which (save 3) had been destroyed in [[Second Spanish Republic|Red Spain]]...I then asked for my coat and hat: Lewis has never forgiven it.\"<ref>Pearce (2004), page 422.</ref>\n\nRoy Campbell returned home from the meeting looking \"wan and tired\". When Mary questioned him about it, he responded, \"It's no good, kid. He's as bad as the others\". Mosley, however, was not put off and continued his courtship of Campbell through senior BUF member [[William Joyce]]. Despite Mosley's promise to make him \"the official poet\" of the Fascist movement in the [[United Kingdom]], Campbell refused to be recruited and the effort was abandoned.<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 261\">Pearce (2004), page 261.</ref>\n\nSoon after the meeting with Mosley, Campbell read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and said of [[Adolf Hitler]], \"Good gracious! This man won't do - he's a tee[[totalitarian]] [[vegetarian]]!\"<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 261\"/>\n\nOn 29 January 1937, the family set sail to Lisbon on the German vessel ''Niasa''.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 267</ref>\n\n==War correspondent and propagandist==\nIn June, Campbell left Portugal for Spain, going to [[Salamanca]] and then to Toledo, where he retrieved the personal papers of [[Saint John of the Cross]] from a hiding place in his former flat.  Campbell then attempted to enlist in one of the [[Carlist]] militias, but was informed by [[Alfonso Merry del Val]], the head of the Nationalist Press Service, that he could better serve as a [[war correspondent]] alongside Franco's armies. Travelling on a journalist's pass issued by Merry del Val, Campbell left Toledo on 30 June 1937 and was driven to [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]], where he suffered a serious fall, twisting his left hip. The following day, the special car traveled southwards from the front, ending its lightning tour in Seville. This visit appears to have been Campbell's only front line experience of the war. However, that would not keep him from later suggesting that he had seen far more action than he had.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 269\u2013272</ref> He did not fight for the Nationalists during the Spanish conflict, despite later claims.<ref>Christopher Othen, ''[[Franco's International Brigades: Foreign Volunteers and Fascist Dictators in the Spanish Civil War]]'' (Destino, 2007) p. 107</ref>\n\nCampbell's glorification of the military strength and masculine virtues of Franco's Spain drew a poor reaction back home, and his reputation suffered considerably as a result. Campbell had been a strong opponent of [[Marxism]] for some time, and fighting against it was also a strong motivation. In his poem ''Flowering Rifle'', Campbell mocked the combat deaths of Republican soldiers, praised the Nationalists for defending the Church, and accused Communists of committing far more heinous atrocities than any Fascist government. In a [[footnote]] attached to the poem, he declared, \"More people have been imprisoned for Liberty, humiliated and tortured for Equality, and slaughtered for Fraternity in this century, than for any less hypocritical motives, during the [[Middle Ages]].\"<ref>''Roy Campbell: Selected Poems'', Edited and Introduced by [[Joseph Pearce]]. [[Saint Austin Press]], London, 2001. Page 65.</ref>\n\nAccording to South African Campbell scholar Judith L\u00fctge Coullie, \"Many of R[oy] C[ampbell]'s contemporaries, as well as his biographer Peter Alexander, felt that he was extremely na\u00efve politically and thus did not grasp the implications of his support for [[Falange|the Party]] that defended the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Judith L\u00fctge Coullie (2011), ''Remembering Roy Campbell: The Memoirs of his Daughters Anna and Tess'', pages xii-xiii.</ref>\n\nRepublican sympathisers the world over were outraged and the Scottish Communist poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] wrote an angry response entitled ''The Battle Continues''. The second stanza included the lines:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nFranco has made no more horrible shambles\nThan this poem of Campbell's\nThe foulest outrage [[Clan Campbell|his breed]] has to show\nSince the [[massacre of Glencoe]]!<ref>MacDiarmid, Hugh, 'The Battle Continues' (1957) in MacDiarmid, ''Complete Poems 1920\u20131976, Volume II'' London: Martin Brien & O'Keeffe, 1978), p. 905</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nCampbell's former friend [[C. S. Lewis]], who had first met him as an Oxford undergraduate, also attacked him in a poem titled \"To the Author of ''Flowering Rifle''\". In the poem, Lewis denounced Campbell's \"lack of charity\" and called him a \"loud fool\" who had learnt the art of lying from the very Communists he so claimed to despise.<ref>C. S. Lewis: \"To the Author of ''Flowering Rifle''\", ''The Cherwell'', 6 May 1939</ref> Lewis had further declared,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n\u2014Who cares\nWhich kind of shirt the murdering Party wears?<ref>Joseph Pearce, ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', [[Ignatius Press]], 2005. Page 236.</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nLewis concluded his poem by arguing that in a conflict as mutually bloody as the Spanish Civil War, only a neutral course could be considered honourable.\n\nIn September 1938, the Campbell family went to Italy, where they stayed until the end of the Spanish Civil War. After the publication of ''Flowering Rifle'' in February 1939, they became popular in the higher echelons of Roman society. They returned to Spain in April, 1939. On 19 May, Roy and Mary Campbell traveled to Madrid for the Victory Parade of Franco's forces.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 281\u2013294</ref>\n\n==The Second World War==\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Campbell denounced [[Nazi Germany]] and returned to Britain. He did duty as an [[Air Raid Precautions]] warden in London. During this period he met and befriended [[Dylan Thomas]], a fellow [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of [[St. David]]'s Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as having a bad hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the [[British Army]]. He was accepted by the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] because of his knowledge of languages and began training as a private with the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]] on 1 April 1942.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 318, 321</ref> Having completed [[basic training]], Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 323</ref> In February 1943, he was promoted to [[sergeant]], and in March he was posted to [[British East Africa]]. On 5 May, he arrived in [[Nairobi]] and was attached to the [[King's African Rifles]], serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor, he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 329</ref> However, any hope of seeing real action in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.\n\nIn the aftermath, Campbell was employed, between September 1943 and April 1944, as a [[coast-watcher]], looking out for enemy submarines on the Kenyan coast north of [[Mombasa]]. During this period, he made several sojourns in hospital due to attacks of malaria.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 330</ref> On  2 April 1944, he was discharged from the army as unfit owing to chronic osteoarthritis in his left hip.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> The intention was to transport him home to England, but due to an administrative error, he was sent by sea to South Africa. Early in June he set sail north again through the Suez Canal on the hospital ship ''Oranje'', arriving in Liverpool towards the end of the month. After convalescing in a hospital in Stockport, Campbell rejoined his wife; since their house had been bombed, they lived for a time in Oxford with the Catholic writers Bernard and [[Barbara Wall (writer)|Barbara Wall]].<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 335</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1944, Campbell spent an evening with [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. Lewis later wrote that he detested what he considered  \"Campbell's particular blend of [[Catholicism]] and [[Fascism]]\".<ref>Humphrey Carpenter: ''The Inklings. C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams and their friends'', Unwin Paperbacks (1981), p. 192.</ref>\n\nWhen he met Campbell, Lewis, feeling belligerent after consuming several glasses of port, recited his poem ''To the Author of Flowering Rifle'' aloud, while Campbell laughed off the provocation.\n\nTolkien, who was then hard at work writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', was charmed by Campbell. In a letter to his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], Tolkien compared Campbell to Trotter, a torture-crippled hobbit character in his novel, who would become the character of [[Aragorn]] in the final draft. Tolkien described Campbell as follows, \"Here is a scion of an [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster prot]]. family resident in S. Africa, most of whom fought in both wars, who became a Catholic after sheltering the [[Carmelite]] fathers in [[Barcelona]] \u2014 in vain, they were caught & butchered, and R.C. nearly lost his life. But he got the Carmelite archives from the burning library and took them through the [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red country]]. [...] However it is not possible to convey an impression of such a rare character, both a soldier and a poet, and a Christian convert. How unlike the Left \u2013 the 'corduroy panzers' who fled to America [...]<ref name=\"Letters\">''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', no. 83, to [[Christopher Tolkien]], 6 October 1944</ref>\n\nAccording to Tolkien, Lewis's belief that support for the Nationalists equated to Fascism was grounded in a refusal to face facts about Republican atrocities, which in turn was based in residual [[Anti-Catholicism]] from his Protestant upbringing in [[Northern Ireland]], \"But hatred of our church is after all the real foundation of the C[hurch] of E[ngland] \u2014 so deep laid that it remains even when all the superstructure seems removed (C.S.L. for instance reveres the [[Blessed Sacrament]], and admires nuns!). Yet if a [[Lutheran]] is put in jail he is up in arms; but if [[Red Terror (Spain)|Catholic priests are slaughtered]] \u2014 he disbelieves it (and I daresay really thinks they asked for it). But Campbell shook him up a bit.\"<ref name=\"Letters\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath, Campbell joined Tolkien and Lewis at several meetings of the [[Inklings]] at [[The Eagle and Child]] pub, where his \"poetry, political views, and religious perspectives caused quite a stir.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Company They Keep|last = Glyer|first = Diana|publisher = Kent State UP|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-87338-890-0|location = Kent, OH|pages = 13}}</ref>\n\n==Post-war life and works==\nFor many years, Campbell worked at the [[BBC]] and remained a fixture. During a poetry recitation by avowed [[Communist]] poet [[Stephen Spender]], Campbell stormed the stage and punched him, saying that he had an objection to Spender's poetry from the Sergeant's mess of the [[King's African Rifles]]. However, Spender refused to press charges, saying, \"He is a great poet\u2026 We must try to understand.\"<ref>Peter Alexander, ''Roy Campbell: A Critical Biography'', 214; Joseph Pearce, ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf: The Friends and Enemies of Roy Campbell'', 377; Parsons, D.

''Roy Campbell: A Descriptive and Annotated Bibliography with Notes on Unpublished Sources'', New York: Garland Pub, 1981, 155.</ref> Spender later broke with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and presented Campbell with the 1952 [[Foyle Prize]] for his verse translations of [[St. John of the Cross]].<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 397.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the Campbells moved to [[Linh\u00f3, Sintra|Linh\u00f3]], [[Sintra]], on the [[Portuguese Riviera]]. Although [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] was not technically Fascist, emigrating to it after the War further contributed to Campbell's bad reputation among the British [[intelligentsia]]. The regime of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] was by then far more to Campbell's tastes than Franco's Spain, which was compromised in his mind by an intimate collaboration with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]]. In Portugal, he wrote a new version of his autobiography, ''Light on a Dark Horse''. In 1953 he embarked on a lecture tour of Canada and the United States. Organized by the Canadian poet and editor [[John Sutherland (Canadian writer)|John Sutherland]], the tour was largely a success, though it did cause protests to be organized by members of the American and Canadian Communist Parties against Campbell's allegedly \"Fascistic opinions\".<ref>''The Letters of John Sutherland'', Bruce Whiteman, ed. (Toronto: ECW Press, 1992), p. 285.</ref> During the 1950s, Campbell was also a contributor to ''[[The European (1953 magazine)|The European]]'', a magazine published in France and edited by [[Diana Mosley]]. ''The European'' could also boast contributions from [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Henry Williamson]].<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', obituary of Lady Mosley, 13 Aug. 2003.</ref>\n\nAfter Campbell's conversion to Catholicism, he wrote spiritual verse. Campbell also wrote travel guides and children's literature. He began translating poetry from languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[French language|French]]. Among the poets he translated were [[Spanish people|Spanish]] poet [[Francisco de Quevedo]], the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], the [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] poet [[Manuel Bandeira]], the Ancient Roman poet [[Horace]], and the [[Nicaraguan people|Nicaraguan]] poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]].\n\nCampbell also produced sensitive translations into English of [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], a Spanish poet, outspoken [[Marxist]], and [[homosexual]], who was abducted and murdered by the Nationalists at the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>''[[The Oxford Companion to English Literature]]''</ref><ref>''Roy Campbell; Selected Poems'', Saint Austin Press, London, 2001. Pages 124\u2013134.</ref> In a self-deprecating poem titled \"On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca\", Campbell wrote,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nNot only did he lose his life\nBy shots assassinated:\nBut with a hammer and a knife\nWas after that\u2014translated.<ref>Roy Campbell, ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], 1955. Page 283. \"On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca.\"</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\nRoy Campbell died in a car accident near [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal, on [[Easter Monday]], 1957. The Campbell's were returning home from attending [[Easter Sunday]] in [[Sevilla]].\n\nAccording to his daughter Anna Campbell Lyle, \"On the day, in fact at the very hour, that Father was dying in a car crash on a lonely road in [[Portugal]], I was buying a black coat at Simpson's in [[Piccadilly]]. It was 3:30 in the afternoon of the 23rd of April 1957 - the birthday and, according to tradition, also the death day of [[Shakespeare]]. The car my parents were travelling in, a small [[Fiat]] 300, had one very worn Tyre. Mary, my mother, who did all the driving, thought she had had this Tyre put at the back, but the mechanic made a mistake when servicing the car, and put it in front of the right hand side where my father sat. He was a big man and under his weight the tyre which had held out since Seville burst, and the car crashed into a tree on a lonely road near [[Setubal]], south of [[Lisbon]]. Both my parents were knocked unconscious instantly. Father was driven to a hospital at Setubal by some people who passed shortly after the accident. He died on the way, after murmuring some words and giving two deep sighs. Mother recovered after a long convalescence, but she was never the same, brave optimist again; though she did retain her sense of humour and enchantment. Certainly a part of her died with Father and she blamed herself for his death. This was nonsense; fate had joined them; fate had now separated them\".<ref>Anna and Teresa Campbell (2011), ''Remembering Roy Campbell: The Memoirs of His Daughters Anna and Tess'', [[Winged Lion Press]]. Edited by Judith L\u00fctge Coullie. Preface by [[Joseph Pearce]]. Page 1.</ref>\n\nAnna also writes, \"Mary was deeply religious and it was a great happiness to her to know that Father had died two days after receiving the [[Eucharist|Sacrament]] on [[Easter Sunday]], so that he was in a [[State (theology)|State of Grace]] when his soul left his body. Father was buried in the cemetery of Sao Pedro in [[Sintra]] (the Cintra of [[Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|Childe Harold]]'') on the 26th. I often go there to take flowers to his tomb in which Mary now lies. This is not to be their last resting place. The South Africans want their greatest poet to be buried in what was, when all is said, the part of the planet he loved most\". According to South African Campbell scholar Judith L\u00fctge Coullie, however, inquiries about efforts to move Roy and Mary Campbell's remains to South Africa \"have drawn a blank. It is unlikely, however, to be a priority in post-[[Apartheid]] South Africa\".<ref>Anna and Teresa Campbell (2011), page 3.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAt the time of his death, Campbell was working upon translations of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish plays. Although only the rough drafts were completed, Campbell's work was posthumously edited for publication by [[Eric Bentley]] under the title, ''Life Is a Dream and Other Spanish Classics''.\n\nCampbell's vocal attacks upon the [[Marxism]] and [[Freudianism]] popular among the British [[intelligentsia]] caused him to be a controversial figure during his own lifetime. It has been suggested by some critics and by his daughters in their memoirs that his support for [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]] has caused him to be labelled a [[Fascist]] and [[blacklist]]ed from modern poetry anthologies. Efforts have been made to restore Campbell's literary reputation. According to his daughters and his biographer [[Joseph Pearce]], the poet's opposition to the Spanish Republic was based on a belief that it was controlled by the Stalin's [[NKVD]] and on real experience with both [[Red Terror (Spain)|Republican war crimes]] and the [[religious persecution]] of Spain's [[Roman Catholic]] majority. Also according to Pearce, Campbell's verse satires, which his wife and daughters often begged him to stop writing, were modelled after similar satires composed centuries earlier by eminent poets [[John Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name=\"catholicauthors\">[http://www.catholicauthors.com/roy_campbell.html \"Roy Campbell: Bombast and Fire\" \u2013 Catholic Author\u2019s article]</ref><ref>Joseph Pearce, \"Introduction,\" in ''Roy Campbell: Selected Poems'' (London: Saint Austin Press, 2001), xxv</ref><ref>[http://spectator.org/archives/2009/10/12/a-dark-horse \"A Dark Horse\" ''American Spectator'']</ref>\n\nCampbell's translations of the French [[Symbolist]] poets [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]] have appeared in modern anthologies.\n\nAlso, in a 1968 lecture at [[Harvard University]], Campbell's translations of the Catholic mystical poetry of [[St. John of the Cross]] were lavishly praised by [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. Borges called Campbell, \"a great Scottish poet who is also South African\", and called his versions of St. John's poetry, in some ways, superior to the original poems in Spanish.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges, ''This Craft of Verse'', Harvard University Press, 2000. Pages 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Literary style==\n\nMuch of Campbell's verse was satirical and written in [[heroic couplets]], a form otherwise rare in 20th-century English verse. Rhymed verse was generally his favoured medium. One modern assessment of his poetry is that \"he was vigorous in all he wrote, but not distinctly original.\"<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', Bloomsbury: 1989</ref>\n\nThis is Campbell celebrating fertility and sexuality, in ''Anadyomene'' (1924):\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nMaternal Earth stirs redly from beneath\nHer blue sea-blanket and her quilt of sky,\nA giant Anadyomene from the sheath\nAnd chrysalis of darkness; till we spy\nHer vast barbaric haunches, furred with trees,\nStretched on the continents, and see her hair\nCombed in a surf of fire along the breeze\nTo curl about the dim sierras, where\nFaint snow-peaks catch the sun's far-swivelled beams:\nAnd, tinder to his rays, the mountain-streams\nKindle, and volleying with a thunderstroke\nOut of their roaring gullies, burst in smoke\nTo shred themselves as fine as women's hair,\nAnd hoop gay rainbows on the sunlit air.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nOn the subject of nature, Campbell produced poetry such as this in his ''The Zebras'' (1931):\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nFrom the dark woods that breathe of fallen showers,\nHarnessed with level rays in golden reins,\nThe zebras draw the dawn across the plains\nWading knee-deep among the scarlet flowers.\nThe sunlight, zithering their flanks with fire,\nFlashes between the shadows as they pass\nBarred with electric tremors through the grass\nLike wind along the gold strings of a lyre.\n\nInto the flushed air snorting rosy plumes\nThat smoulder round their feet in drifting fumes,\nWith dove-like voices call the distant fillies,\nWhile round the herds the stallion wheels his flight,\nEngine of beauty volted with delight,\nTo roll his mare among the trampled lilies.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''The Flaming Terrapin''

[[poetry|poet]] and [[satire|satirist]] of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] descent. Despite being lavishly praised at the beginning of his career in the [[1920s]], Campbell's subsequent conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]] and his poetic attacks against [[The Bloomsbury Group]], [[Sigmund Freud]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[Second Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], caused him to become a polarising figure during his lifetime. Despite Campbell's attacks against [[racism]] in his native South Africa and his angry rejection of [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]'s efforts to recruit him into the [[British Union of Fascists]], Campbell continues to be labeled a [[fascist]] and left out of poetry anthologies and college courses.\n\nAccording to [[Roger Scruton]], \"Campbell wrote vigorous rhyming [[pentameter]]s, into which he instilled the most prodigious array of images and the most intoxicating draft of life of any poet of the [[20th century]]...He was also a [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling adventurer]] and a dreamer of dreams. And his life and writings contain so many lessons about the British experience in the 20th century that it is worth revisiting them.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Scruton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2009/10/12/a-dark-horse/print |title=A Dark Horse |publisher=spectator.org |date=October 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\n==Family Origins==\nAccording to Campbell, his paternal ancestors were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Covenanters]] and members of [[Clan Campbell]], who left [[Scotland]] after the defeat of the [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]] by the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] in 1645 and settled as part of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in [[Carndonagh]], in [[Inishowen]],  [[County Donegal]].<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 4\">Pearce (2004), page 4.</ref>\n\nDuring the centuries when they lived in Donegal, the [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] ancestors of the poet were small farmers. Many of the men were talented [[Irish fiddle|fiddlers]]. According to the family's oral tradition, the living standards of the Campbell family improved drastically around 1750, when one of the poet's ancestors eloped with the daughter of Carndonagh's [[Anglo-Irish]] landlord.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 4-5.</ref>\n\nThe poet's grandfather, William Campbell, set sail for the [[Colony of Natal]] with his family aboard the [[brigantine]] ''Conquering Hero'' from [[Glasgow]] in 1850. When they arrived, there was little sign of the city of [[Durban]], which would become the greatest port city in Southern Africa, except a fortress and a few mud huts. However, William Campbell adapted well to life in [[Africa]] and built the breakwater that still forms the foundation of the great North Pier in Durban harbor. He also built a large and very successful [[sugar cane]] plantation.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 2-3.</ref>\n\nThe poet's father, Samuel George Campbell, was born in Durban in 1861. In 1878 he traveled to [[Edinburgh]] to study medicine and won prizes for surgery, clinical surgery, and [[botany]]. He graduated with honors in 1882 and completed postgraduate work at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]]. He also studied ear, nose and throat ailments in [[Vienna]]. In 1886, he returned to Scotland to take his [[M.D.]] and to become a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]. While in Scotland, Dr. Campbell married Margaret Wylie Dunnachie, daughter of James Dunnachie, of [[Glenboig]], [[Lanarkshire]], a wealthy self-made businessman, and Jean Hendry of [[Eaglesham]].<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 4\"/><ref name=\"dictionary\">[[The Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref>\n\nAccording to the poet, his Dunnachie ancestors were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] who fled [[Scotland]] after the [[Jacobite Uprising of 1745]], but returned after the [[Act of Indemnity 1747|act of indemnity]].<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 4\"/>\n\nAlso according to the poet, his maternal grandfather, James Dunnachie, was an acquaintance of [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred Tennyson]], and also corresponded for many years with [[Mark Twain]].<ref>Pearce (2004), page 5.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, Doctor and Mrs. Campbell moved back to Natal, where he established a very successful medical practice. He would often travel long distances on foot to treat his patients and, in an unprejudiced approach deeply rare in Colonial South Africa, would treat both black and white patients. His generosity to patients who could not afford to pay was also legendary. For this reason, \"Sam Joj\", as he was called, was deeply loved by the [[Zulu people]] of Natal.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 5-6.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood===\nRoy Campbell the third son of Dr. Samuel and Margaret Campbell, was born in [[Durban]], [[Colony of Natal]], on October 2, 1901. At the time of his birth, the [[Second Boer War]] was still being fought and Roy's father was on [[active service]] as a [[Major]] with the Natal Volunteer Medical Corps. For this was reason, it was several days before Maj. Campbell learned of the birth of his son. In a [[Uniting Presbyterian Church in Southern Africa|Presbyterian]] ceremony, the baby was [[baptism|christened]] Royston Dunnachie Campbell after an uncle by marriage.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 6.</ref>\n\nRoy later said that his first memory was of a day when his [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nurse maid, Catherine Mgadi, wheeled him further than usual on their morning outing. The hedge they had been skirting suddenly stopped and they came across an empty, railed in site overlooking the [[Indian Ocean]], which a fascinated Roy glimpsed through the legs of a [[horse]]. Sensing Roy's fascination, Catherine told him that the Indian Ocean was \"''Lwandhla''\", the word for the sea in the [[Zulu language]]. Roy later recalled, \"''Lwandhla'', which in two-syllables, [[Homeric]]ally expressed the pride and glory of the ocean and the plunge of its breakers, struck my mind with a force which no other word or line in prose or poetry has ever had for me since. I went on repeating the word ''lwandhla'' for days. It was the first word I remember ''learning''.\" In later years, both horses and the sea would be regular themes in Campbell's poetry.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 1-2.</ref>\n\nAnother figure who greatly influenced the poet's youth was Dooglie, a Highlander whom Doctor Campbell had met in Scotland and brought back with him to Natal. In Durban, Dooglie taught the Doctor's sons both the [[Great Highland bagpipe|Highland bagpipes]] and [[Highland dancing]]. Roy's elder brothers, Archie and George, were soon so adept at both that they won medals in the junior category during competitions organized by the local Caledonian Society.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 2.</ref> Roy later wrote, \"From those times onwards, till recently, I always believed we were pure Scotch Highlanders by descent. I only discovered our [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[French people|French]] ancestry by accident.\"<ref>Roy Campbell (1951),''Light on a Dark Horse'', Hollis & Carter, London. Page 30.</ref>\n\nWhenever Dooglie played the [[bagpipes]], the Campbell's neighbor, an immigrant from the [[German Empire]], always reacted with outrage. The poet later wrote: <blockquote>To the compatriot of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Bach]], living on the other side of the [[corrugated iron]] fence which separated our two gardens, with his more exalted ideas of music, the braying of the bagpipes (or 'pack-vives' as he called them) was an insult and a nightmare. So whenever the 'pack-vives' started up from our side of the fence, Herr Kruger, in sheer self defense, would line up his entire staff of some dozen native servants, arm them with bricks, and get them to pound and hammer on the fence, and to yell with all their might, while two [[Indians in South Africa|Indian waiters]] hammered on [[brass]] trays, as if they were trying to scare away a swarm of [[locust]]s. Then we would see Herr Kruger himself...waving his arms in paroxysms of fury, like the conductor of some infernal [[orchestra]]: and screeching and howling, as loud as the pipes themselves: \"Harriple pack-vives! Harriple pack-vives! Ha-a-a-riple pack-vives!\"<ref>Campbell (1951), page 30.</ref></blockquote>Dooglie invariably responded to Herr Kruger's objections by playing his bagpipes even louder, until all the dogs, donkeys, horses, and cattle in the neighborhood caught on to the excitement and added their own voices to the cacophony.<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 7\">Pearce (2004), page 7.</ref>\n\nAt first, Roy and Catherine would react to these noisy disputes by cowering under the bed. In times however, they would experience, \"a sort of awed, bewildered exhilaration... and would run round in circles, leaping, jumping, pulling faces, waving our arms like Herr Kruger, and imitating the noises of the pipes, the natives, and the Herr, indiscriminately, by turns.\"<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 7\"/>\n\nAfter the birth of his younger brother Neil, Roy was increasingly left in the care of his Zulu nurse and he would later recall, \"I got a good many of my ideas from Catherine.<ref>Campbell (1951), page 46.</ref>\n\nAccording to Joseph Pearce: <blockquote>This cross-current of cultural influences, the flow of Gaelic tradition interacting with the perceptions of a Zulu child, colored Roy Campbell's formative years. It produced a cultural hybrid, an Afro-[[Celts (modern)|Celtic]], which was itself a by-product of [[Colonialism]]. Thus Roy and his brother's were dressed for church in Eton collars on Sunday and in [[kilt]]s the next, but also, in accordance with African custom, they shot their first buck at the age of eight. Similarly, they learned [[Border ballads|Scots ballads]] from their parents and [[African folklore]] from the natives. At the very moment that Roy was discovering the delights of the [[English language]] in verse, he was also learning the [[Zulu language]] through his conversations with Catherine.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 7-8.</ref></blockquote>Campbell also played regularly with boys from among the [[Zulu people]]. He later wrote: <blockquote>The Zulus are a highly intellectual people. They have a very beautiful language, a little on the bombastic side and highly adorned. Its effect on me can be seen in ''The Flaming Terrapin''. Above all, the Zulu are great hableurs and boasters; the one thing they love is conversation. It is the only art they have, but it is a very great art... They take enormous delight in conversation, analyzing with the greatest subtlety and brilliance. Only our really great conversationalists equal them. They are full of [[Sancho Panza|Sancho]]-like [[proverb]]s and optimistic wisdom. And they have extremely sunny temperaments.<ref>Roy Campbell (1934), ''Broken Record'', page 59.</ref></blockquote>His daughter, Teresa Campbell, also recalled: <blockquote>My father was born and bred among the natives of South Africa. He got to love their wisdom and integrity. He respected them tremendously - to him they became as brothers. He spent all his happy childhood years with them and learnt a lot about life from this close association. It was this deep sharing of life with him that gave him his clear insight to the [[Apartheid|South African problem]]. We were always surprised at the uncommon ease with which he could mix with any company - with peasants and fishermen. This, my mother said, came from his early mixing with the native Africans.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 10.</ref></blockquote>In later years, Roy Campbell's empathy for the plight of the [[Zulu people]] under rule by [[White South Africans]] expressed itself in his [[sonnet]]s ''The Zulu Girl'',<ref>Roy Campbell (2001), ''Selected Poems'', Edited and Introduced by Joseph Pearce. Pages 6-7.</ref> ''The Serf'',\n<ref>Campbell (2001), page 5.</ref> and in his [[literary translation]] of a ''Zulu Song''.<ref>Campbell (2001), page 6.</ref>\n\n===Teenager===\nEducated at [[Durban High School]], Campbell counted [[literature]] and the outdoor life among his first loves. He was an accomplished [[Equestrianism|horseman]] and [[fisherman]].\n\nCampbell left the [[Union of South Africa]] in December 1918 for [[Oxford University]], where he arrived early in 1919. Roy, who considered himself a Celt, had already conceived an intense hatred of \"Anglo-Saxondom\" and the [[British Empire]]. Therefore, despite his descent from Orangemen, in letters to his parents, Roy expressed admiration and support for both [[Sinn Fein]] and the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|IRA]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]].<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 37-38.</ref>\n\nHowever, he failed the entrance examination.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 26, 33\u201334</ref> Reporting this to his father, he took a philosophical stance, telling him that \"university lectures interfere very much with my work,\" which was writing poetry.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> His verse writing was stimulated by avid readings of [[Nietzsche]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and the English [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan]] and [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poets. Among his early fruitful contacts were [[C.S. Lewis]], [[William Walton]], [[the Sitwells]], and [[Wyndham Lewis]].<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> Campbell wrote verse imitations of [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]. He also began to drink heavily, and continued to do so for the rest of his life.\n\nCampbell left Oxford for London in 1920. Holidays spent in wandering through [[France]] and along the Mediterranean coast alternated with periods in London's [[Bohemianism|literary bohemia]]. In 1922, he married without parental consent and forfeited, for a time, his generous parental allowance.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> His wife was Lady [[Mary Garman|Mary Margaret Garman]], eldest of the [[Garman Sisters|Garman sisters]]. They had two daughters, Teresa (Tess) and Anna.\n\n==Poet and satirist==\nWhile living in a small converted stable on the coast of [[North Wales]], Campbell completed his first long poem, ''The Flaming Terrapin'', a [[humanistic]] [[allegory]] of the rejuvenation of man projected in episodes. It was published in 1924.\n\n''The Flaming Terrapin'' had established his reputation as a rising star and was favourably compared to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s recently released poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''.  His verse was well-received by Eliot himself, [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Edith Sitwell]], and many others.\n\n==''Voorslag''==\nReturning to South Africa with Mary in 1925, Campbell started ''[[Voorslag]]'', a literary magazine with the ambition to serve as a \"whiplash\" (the meaning of the title in [[Afrikaans]]) on South African colonial society, which he considered \"bovine\". Before the magazine was launched, Campbell invited [[William Plomer]] to help with it, and late in the year, [[Laurens van der Post]] was invited to become the magazine's [[Afrikaans]] editor. ''Voorslag'' was, according to Joseph Pearce, one of the first [[bilingual]] literary journals ever published in South Africa.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 82.</ref>\n\nThe first issue included a [[book review]] in which Campbell praised Plomer's recent novel ''Turbott Wolfe''. The novel depicted a White artist filling his studio with Black women as his models and sexual partners, much to the outrage of the artist's [[racist]] White neighbors. Plomer courted further controversy by ending his novel with an [[interracial marriage]] between a Black man and a White woman. For these reasons, Plomer's ''Turbott Wolfe'' had been dubbed, \"A Nasty Book on a Nasty Subject,\" by the ''[[Natal Advertiser]]''.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 82-83.</ref>\n\nIn his review for ''Voorslag'', Campbell praised ''Turbott Wolfe'' as \"just and true\", but also criticized Plomer for [[dehumanisation|dehumanizing]] the White racists in his novel. Campbell wrote: <blockquote>Mr. Plomer has shown his white characters when acting under the influence of race-feeling, behaving with typical ferocity and injustice. But he fails to let them relax enough into their individual and comparative dignity. He keeps pointing at them all the time and nudging the reader. I have known many farmers who capable of the most callous and criminal behaviour to the blacks, were guilless sons of the soil, as innocent as sleeping babes, with devout souls and sky-blue eyes. Their cruelty and impulsiveness was not even remembered when they relapsed again into their individual rationality. This type is much more normal than the bloodthirsty type described by Mr. Plomer and it confronts one with a far more terrible enigma. If Mr. Plomer had realized this his [[satire]] would have been more devastatingly complete and he might have achieved a masterpiece.<ref>Pearce (2004), page 83.</ref></blockquote>Elsewhere in the same issue, Campbell \"attacked Colonial South Africa with unrestrained venom\". He wrote that the White man's [[racial superiority]] was \"a [[superstition]] which was exploded by science ten years ago and by [[Christianity]] two thousand years before.\" As a nation, he wrote that South Africa lagged \"three hundred years behind modern [[Europe]] and five hundred years behind modern art and science.\" Furthermore, he accused [[White South Africans]] of being little more than a nation of [[parasites]]. Campbell concluded: <blockquote>We have no excuse for our [[parasitism]] on the native and the sooner we realize it the safer for our future. We are as a race without thinkers, without leaders, without even a physical [[aristocracy]] working on the land. The study of modern [[anthropology]] should be encouraged as it would give us a better sense of our position in the [[family tree]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' - which is among the lower branches: it might even rouse us to assert ourselves in some less ignoble way than reclining blissfully in a grocer's paradise and feeding on the labour of the natives.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 83-84.</ref></blockquote>Both ''Voorslag'' articles outraged the White population of [[Natal, South Africa (disambiguation)|Natal]]. In response, the magazine's owner, Lewis Reynolds, informed Campbell that, in the future, his editorial control over ''Voorslag'' was going to be drastically limited. Campbell resigned in protest.\n\nTo his grief and horror, Campbell found himself subjected to social [[ostracism]] by the Whites of Durban and found that even members of his own family wanted nothing to do with him. Left destitute, Campbell wrote to his friend C.J. Sibbett, a wealthy [[Cape Town]] advertising executive, and asked for a gift of \u00a350, so that he and his family could return to England. Campbell concluded, \"None of my relations will look at me because of the opinions I have expressed in ''Voorslag''.\"<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 81\u201385, 92-93.</ref>\n\nSibbett, who immediately sent Campbell the money, wrote to the editor of the ''[[Natal Witness]]'', \"I am very glad to hear where your sympathies lie in the ''Voorslag'' controversy. Roy and Plomer were like [[thoroughbred]]s pitted against pack-[[mule]]s. Natal seems to me to be [[Wesleyan]]-ridden with a strong dash of [[Calvinism]] thrown in and it is astonishing how these two Cuckoo eggs came to be hatched there.\"<ref>Pearce (2004), page 95.</ref>\n\nBefore leaving South Africa with his family in 1927, Campbell reacted to his ostracism by writing the poem ''The Making of a Poet'', which compares himself to \"some restive steer', who \"keeps the wolf at bay\" from the cattle herd that has cast out and rejected him.<ref>Roy Campbell (1955), ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], [[Chicago]]. Pages 27-28.</ref> Campbell also wrote ''Tristan da Cunha'',<ref>Campbell (1955), pages 40-43.</ref> and ''The Wayzgoose'', a lampoon, in [[heroic couplets]], on the [[racism]] and other cultural shortcomings of Colonial South Africa. The poem included belligerent attacks against those who Campbell felt had wronged him in the controversy over ''Voorslag''. ''The Wayzgoose'' was published in 1928.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/><ref>Roy Campbell, ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], 1955. Pages 243\u2013268.</ref>\n\nIn a 1956 letter to [[Harvey Brit]], who had accused Campbell of being a [[Fascist]], the latter wrote, \"I am an exile...from my country because I stood up for fair play for the blacks - is that [[Fascism]]?\"<ref>Pearce (2004), page 423.</ref>\n\n==Bloomsbury==\nHaving returned to London, Campbell began to move in literary circles. Though initially on friendly terms with the [[Bloomsbury Group]], the poet subsequently became very hostile to them, declaring that they were sexually [[promiscuous]], [[snobbish]], and [[anti-Christian]].\n\nAccording to [[Roger Scruton]], <blockquote>Learning that his wife had been conducting a passionate affair with [[Vita Sackville-West|Vita]] (to the enraged jealousy of Vita\u2019s other lover, [[Virginia Woolf]]), Campbell began to see the three aspects of the new elite\u2014sexual inversion, anti-patriotism, and progressive politics\u2014as aspects of a single frame of mind. These three qualities amounted, for Campbell, to a refusal to grow up. The new elite, in Campbell\u2019s opinion, lived as bloodless parasites on their social inferiors and moral betters; they jettisoned real responsibilities in favor of utopian fantasies and flattered themselves that their precious sensibilities were signs of moral refinement, rather than the marks of a fastidious [[narcissism]]. The role of the poet is not to join their [[Peter Pan]] games but to look beneath such frolics for the source of spiritual renewal.<ref>[[American Spectator]], October 2009. [http://spectator.org/archives/2009/10/12/a-dark-horse/]</ref></blockquote>\n\nReferring to the Bloomsbury Group as \"intellectuals without intellect\", Campbell penned a verse satire of them entitled ''The Georgiad'' (1931). According to [[Joseph Pearce]], <blockquote>As with so much of Campbell's satire, ''The Georgiad's'' invective is too vindictive. It is all too often spoiled by spite. This underlying weakness has obscured the more serious points its author sought to make. Embedded between the attacks on [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Marie Stopes]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and a host of other Bloomsbury's and Georgians are classically refined objections to the prevailing philosophy of scepticism, mounted like pearls of wisdom in the basest of metal. \"Nor knew the Greeks, save in the laughing page, The philosophic emblem of our age.\"... The \"damp philosophy\" of the modern world, as espoused by the archetypical modern poet, was responsible for the prevailing pessimism and disillusionment of the post-war world. In preaching such a philosophy, which was \"the fountain source of all his woes\", the poet's \"damp philosophy\" left him \"damp in spirit\". [[Nihilism]] was self-negating. It was the philosophy of the self-inflicted wound. In the rejection of post-war pessimism and its nihilistic ramifications... Campbell was uniting himself with others, such as [[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]], who were similarly seeking glimmers of philosophical light amidst the prevailing gloom. In his case, as in theirs, the philosophical search would lead him to orthodox [[Christianity]].<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Roy Campbell; Selected Poems'', [[Saint Austin Press]], 2001. Page xx.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Campbells moved to [[Provence]] in the early 1930s.\n\nThe French period saw the publication of, among other writings, ''Adamastor'' (1930), ''Poems'' (1930), ''The Georgiad'' (1931), and the first version of his autobiography, ''Broken Record'' (1934). In 1932, the Campbells retained the [[Afrikaner]] poet [[Uys Krige]] as tutor to Tess and Anna.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 195</ref> During this time he and his wife Mary were slowly being drawn to the [[Catholic|Roman Catholic]] faith, a process which can be traced in a sonnet sequence entitled ''[[Mithraism|Mithraic]] Emblems'' (1936).\n\nA fictionalized version of Campbell at this time (\"Rob McPhail\") appears in the novel ''Snooty Baronet'' by Wyndham Lewis (1932). Campbell's poetry had been published in Lewis' periodical ''[[Blast (journal)|BLAST]]''; he was reportedly happy to appear in the novel but disappointed that his character was killed off (McPhail was gored while fighting a bull).\n\n==Move to Spain==\nIn the autumn of 1933, Tess's goat broke through a neighbour's fence and in the course of a night destroyed a number of young peach trees. The neighbour demanded compensation, which Campbell felt unable to pay. The neighbour then successfully sued for a considerable sum. Campbell still saw no way to pay the indemnity and faced the prospect of imprisonment. He and his wife escaped the authorities by surreptitiously escaping across the border into Spain. They traveled by train to [[Barcelona]], where they were joined a few days later by their children, Uys Krige, the children's French governess, their dog Sarah, and whatever luggage they could carry between them.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\nThe family settled in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. They were formally received into the Catholic Church in the small Spanish village of [[Altea]] in 1935. The English author [[Laurie Lee]] recounts meeting Campbell in the Toledo chapter of ''[[As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning]]'', the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy.\n\nAccording to [[Joseph Pearce]], <blockquote>\"In March 1936 the anti-clerical contagion spreading across Spain reached the streets of Toledo, the ancient city in which the Campbells had made their home. Churches were burned in a series of violent riots in which priests and nuns were attacked. During these bloody disturbances, Roy and Mary Campbell sheltered in their house several of the [[Carmelite]] monks from the neighboring monastery. In the following weeks, the situation worsened. Portraits of [[Marx]] and [[Lenin]] were posted on every street corner, and horrific tales began to filter in from surrounding villages of priests being shot and wealthy men being butchered in front of their families. Toledo's beleaguered Christians braced themselves for the next wave of persecution, and the Campbells, in an atmosphere that must have seemed eerily reminiscent of early Christians in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], were confirmed in a secret ceremony, before dawn, by Cardinal Goma, the elderly Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain. In July 1936, the civil war erupted onto the streets of Toledo, heralded by the arrival in the city of Communist militiamen from [[Madrid]]. With no one to defend them, the priests, monks, and nuns fell prey to the hatred of their adversaries. The seventeen monks from the Carmelite monastery were rounded up, herded on to the street and shot. Campbell discovered their murdered bodies, left lying where they fell. He also discovered the bodies of other priests lying in the narrow street where the priests had been murdered. Swarms of flies surrounded their bodies, and scrawled in their blood on the wall was written, 'Thus strikes the [[CHEKA]].'\"<ref>[[Joseph Pearce]], ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', [[Ignatius Press]], 2001. Pages 196\u2013197.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCampbell later immortalized the incident in his poem ''The Carmelites of Toledo''.<ref>''Roy Campbell; Selected Poems'', [[Saint Austin Press]], 2001. Edited by Joseph Pearce. pp. 52\u201360.</ref>\n\n==England again==\nOn  9 August 1936, the Campbells boarded HMS ''Maine'', which was evacuating British subjects to Marseilles.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 247</ref> Within weeks, they were back in England. After the atrocities he had witnessed, Campbell was deeply offended by the generally pro-Republican sympathies in Britain, where large numbers of young men were volunteering for the [[International Brigades]] and where only British Catholics raised a dissident voice.<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 249-260.</ref>\n\nWhile staying with his openly [[Stalinist]] in-laws at [[Binstead]],<ref>Pearce (2004), pages 259-260.</ref> Campbell found himself being courted by the [[British Union of Fascists]]. In the fall of 1936, [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]] arranged a meeting between Campbell and BUF leader [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. Campbell later recalled of the meeting, \"I not only refused Mosley's and Lewis's offer of a very high position and lucrative position in the Fascist party but explained that I was returning to the ranks to fight [[Marxist-Leninism|Red Fascism]], the worst and most virulent variety, and that when the time came I was ready to fight [[Nazi Germany|Brown]] or [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Black Fascism]] and that I could (though badly disabled) knock both of their brains out there and then! I explained that I was only fighting as a [[Christians|Christian]] for [[religious freedom|the right to pray]] in my own churches, all of which (save 3) had been destroyed in [[Second Spanish Republic|Red Spain]]...I then asked for my coat and hat: Lewis has never forgiven it.\"<ref>Pearce (2004), page 422.</ref>\n\nRoy Campbell returned home from the meeting looking \"wan and tired\". When Mary questioned him about it, he responded, \"It's no good, kid. He's as bad as the others\". Mosley, however, was not put off and continued his courtship of Campbell through senior BUF member [[William Joyce]]. Despite Mosley's promise to make him \"the official poet\" of the Fascist movement in the [[United Kingdom]], Campbell refused to be recruited and the effort was abandoned.<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 261\">Pearce (2004), page 261.</ref>\n\nSoon after the meeting with Mosley, Campbell read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and said of [[Adolf Hitler]], \"Good gracious! This man won't do - he's a tee[[totalitarian]] [[vegetarian]]!\"<ref name=\"Pearce 2004, page 261\"/>\n\nOn 29 January 1937, the family set sail to Lisbon on the German vessel ''Niasa''.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 267</ref>\n\n==War correspondent and propagandist==\nIn June, Campbell left Portugal for Spain, going to [[Salamanca]] and then to Toledo, where he retrieved the personal papers of [[Saint John of the Cross]] from a hiding place in his former flat.  Campbell then attempted to enlist in one of the [[Carlist]] militias, but was informed by [[Alfonso Merry del Val]], the head of the Nationalist Press Service, that he could better serve as a [[war correspondent]] alongside Franco's armies. Travelling on a journalist's pass issued by Merry del Val, Campbell left Toledo on 30 June 1937 and was driven to [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]], where he suffered a serious fall, twisting his left hip. The following day, the special car traveled southwards from the front, ending its lightning tour in Seville. This visit appears to have been Campbell's only front line experience of the war. However, that would not keep him from later suggesting that he had seen far more action than he had.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 269\u2013272</ref> He did not fight for the Nationalists during the Spanish conflict, despite later claims.<ref>Christopher Othen, ''[[Franco's International Brigades: Foreign Volunteers and Fascist Dictators in the Spanish Civil War]]'' (Destino, 2007) p. 107</ref>\n\nCampbell's glorification of the military strength and masculine virtues of Franco's Spain drew a poor reaction back home, and his reputation suffered considerably as a result. Campbell had been a strong opponent of [[Marxism]] for some time, and fighting against it was also a strong motivation. In his poem ''Flowering Rifle'', Campbell mocked the combat deaths of Republican soldiers, praised the Nationalists for defending the Church, and accused Communists of committing far more heinous atrocities than any Fascist government. In a [[footnote]] attached to the poem, he declared, \"More people have been imprisoned for Liberty, humiliated and tortured for Equality, and slaughtered for Fraternity in this century, than for any less hypocritical motives, during the [[Middle Ages]].\"<ref>''Roy Campbell: Selected Poems'', Edited and Introduced by [[Joseph Pearce]]. [[Saint Austin Press]], London, 2001. Page 65.</ref>\n\nAccording to South African Campbell scholar Judith L\u00fctge Coullie, \"Many of R[oy] C[ampbell]'s contemporaries, as well as his biographer Peter Alexander, felt that he was extremely na\u00efve politically and thus did not grasp the implications of his support for [[Falange|the Party]] that defended the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Judith L\u00fctge Coullie (2011), ''Remembering Roy Campbell: The Memoirs of his Daughters Anna and Tess'', pages xii-xiii.</ref>\n\nRepublican sympathisers the world over were outraged and the Scottish Communist poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] wrote an angry response entitled ''The Battle Continues''. The second stanza included the lines:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nFranco has made no more horrible shambles\nThan this poem of Campbell's\nThe foulest outrage [[Clan Campbell|his breed]] has to show\nSince the [[massacre of Glencoe]]!<ref>MacDiarmid, Hugh, 'The Battle Continues' (1957) in MacDiarmid, ''Complete Poems 1920\u20131976, Volume II'' London: Martin Brien & O'Keeffe, 1978), p. 905</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nCampbell's former friend [[C. S. Lewis]], who had first met him as an Oxford undergraduate, also attacked him in a poem titled \"To the Author of ''Flowering Rifle''\". In the poem, Lewis denounced Campbell's \"lack of charity\" and called him a \"loud fool\" who had learnt the art of lying from the very Communists he so claimed to despise.<ref>C. S. Lewis: \"To the Author of ''Flowering Rifle''\", ''The Cherwell'', 6 May 1939</ref> Lewis had further declared,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n\u2014Who cares\nWhich kind of shirt the murdering Party wears?<ref>Joseph Pearce, ''Literary Giants, Literary Catholics'', [[Ignatius Press]], 2005. Page 236.</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nLewis concluded his poem by arguing that in a conflict as mutually bloody as the Spanish Civil War, only a neutral course could be considered honourable.\n\nIn September 1938, the Campbell family went to Italy, where they stayed until the end of the Spanish Civil War. After the publication of ''Flowering Rifle'' in February 1939, they became popular in the higher echelons of Roman society. They returned to Spain in April, 1939. On 19 May, Roy and Mary Campbell traveled to Madrid for the Victory Parade of Franco's forces.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 281\u2013294</ref>\n\n==The Second World War==\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Campbell denounced [[Nazi Germany]] and returned to Britain. He did duty as an [[Air Raid Precautions]] warden in London. During this period he met and befriended [[Dylan Thomas]], a fellow [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of [[St. David]]'s Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as having a bad hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the [[British Army]]. He was accepted by the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] because of his knowledge of languages and began training as a private with the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]] on 1 April 1942.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), pp. 318, 321</ref> Having completed [[basic training]], Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 323</ref> In February 1943, he was promoted to [[sergeant]], and in March he was posted to [[British East Africa]]. On 5 May, he arrived in [[Nairobi]] and was attached to the [[King's African Rifles]], serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor, he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 329</ref> However, any hope of seeing real action in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.\n\nIn the aftermath, Campbell was employed, between September 1943 and April 1944, as a [[coast-watcher]], looking out for enemy submarines on the Kenyan coast north of [[Mombasa]]. During this period, he made several sojourns in hospital due to attacks of malaria.<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 330</ref> On  2 April 1944, he was discharged from the army as unfit owing to chronic osteoarthritis in his left hip.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> The intention was to transport him home to England, but due to an administrative error, he was sent by sea to South Africa. Early in June he set sail north again through the Suez Canal on the hospital ship ''Oranje'', arriving in Liverpool towards the end of the month. After convalescing in a hospital in Stockport, Campbell rejoined his wife; since their house had been bombed, they lived for a time in Oxford with the Catholic writers Bernard and [[Barbara Wall (writer)|Barbara Wall]].<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 335</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1944, Campbell spent an evening with [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. Lewis later wrote that he detested what he considered  \"Campbell's particular blend of [[Catholicism]] and [[Fascism]]\".<ref>Humphrey Carpenter: ''The Inklings. C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams and their friends'', Unwin Paperbacks (1981), p. 192.</ref>\n\nWhen he met Campbell, Lewis, feeling belligerent after consuming several glasses of port, recited his poem ''To the Author of Flowering Rifle'' aloud, while Campbell laughed off the provocation.\n\nTolkien, who was then hard at work writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', was charmed by Campbell. In a letter to his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], Tolkien compared Campbell to Trotter, a torture-crippled hobbit character in his novel, who would become the character of [[Aragorn]] in the final draft. Tolkien described Campbell as follows, \"Here is a scion of an [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster prot]]. family resident in S. Africa, most of whom fought in both wars, who became a Catholic after sheltering the [[Carmelite]] fathers in [[Barcelona]] \u2014 in vain, they were caught & butchered, and R.C. nearly lost his life. But he got the Carmelite archives from the burning library and took them through the [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red country]]. [...] However it is not possible to convey an impression of such a rare character, both a soldier and a poet, and a Christian convert. How unlike the Left \u2013 the 'corduroy panzers' who fled to America [...]<ref name=\"Letters\">''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', no. 83, to [[Christopher Tolkien]], 6 October 1944</ref>\n\nAccording to Tolkien, Lewis's belief that support for the Nationalists equated to Fascism was grounded in a refusal to face facts about Republican atrocities, which in turn was based in residual [[Anti-Catholicism]] from his Protestant upbringing in [[Northern Ireland]], \"But hatred of our church is after all the real foundation of the C[hurch] of E[ngland] \u2014 so deep laid that it remains even when all the superstructure seems removed (C.S.L. for instance reveres the [[Blessed Sacrament]], and admires nuns!). Yet if a [[Lutheran]] is put in jail he is up in arms; but if [[Red Terror (Spain)|Catholic priests are slaughtered]] \u2014 he disbelieves it (and I daresay really thinks they asked for it). But Campbell shook him up a bit.\"<ref name=\"Letters\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath, Campbell joined Tolkien and Lewis at several meetings of the [[Inklings]] at [[The Eagle and Child]] pub, where his \"poetry, political views, and religious perspectives caused quite a stir.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Company They Keep|last = Glyer|first = Diana|publisher = Kent State UP|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-87338-890-0|location = Kent, OH|pages = 13}}</ref>\n\n==Post-war life and works==\nFor many years, Campbell worked at the [[BBC]] and remained a fixture. During a poetry recitation by avowed [[Communist]] poet [[Stephen Spender]], Campbell stormed the stage and punched him, saying that he had an objection to Spender's poetry from the Sergeant's mess of the [[King's African Rifles]]. However, Spender refused to press charges, saying, \"He is a great poet\u2026 We must try to understand.\"<ref>Peter Alexander, ''Roy Campbell: A Critical Biography'', 214; Joseph Pearce, ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf: The Friends and Enemies of Roy Campbell'', 377; Parsons, D.

''Roy Campbell: A Descriptive and Annotated Bibliography with Notes on Unpublished Sources'', New York: Garland Pub, 1981, 155.</ref> Spender later broke with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and presented Campbell with the 1952 [[Foyle Prize]] for his verse translations of [[St. John of the Cross]].<ref>Joseph Pearce: ''Unafraid of Virginia Woolf'' (ISI Books, Wilmington, Delaware: 2004), p. 397.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the Campbells moved to [[Linh\u00f3, Sintra|Linh\u00f3]], [[Sintra]], on the [[Portuguese Riviera]]. Although [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] was not technically Fascist, emigrating to it after the War further contributed to Campbell's bad reputation among the British [[intelligentsia]]. The regime of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] was by then far more to Campbell's tastes than Franco's Spain, which was compromised in his mind by an intimate collaboration with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]]. In Portugal, he wrote a new version of his autobiography, ''Light on a Dark Horse''. In 1953 he embarked on a lecture tour of Canada and the United States. Organized by the Canadian poet and editor [[John Sutherland (Canadian writer)|John Sutherland]], the tour was largely a success, though it did cause protests to be organized by members of the American and Canadian Communist Parties against Campbell's allegedly \"Fascistic opinions\".<ref>''The Letters of John Sutherland'', Bruce Whiteman, ed. (Toronto: ECW Press, 1992), p. 285.</ref> During the 1950s, Campbell was also a contributor to ''[[The European (1953 magazine)|The European]]'', a magazine published in France and edited by [[Diana Mosley]]. ''The European'' could also boast contributions from [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Henry Williamson]].<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', obituary of Lady Mosley, 13 Aug. 2003.</ref>\n\nAfter Campbell's conversion to Catholicism, he wrote spiritual verse. Campbell also wrote travel guides and children's literature. He began translating poetry from languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[French language|French]]. Among the poets he translated were [[Spanish people|Spanish]] poet [[Francisco de Quevedo]], the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], the [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] poet [[Manuel Bandeira]], the Ancient Roman poet [[Horace]], and the [[Nicaraguan people|Nicaraguan]] poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]].\n\nCampbell also produced sensitive translations into English of [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], a Spanish poet, outspoken [[Marxist]], and [[homosexual]], who was abducted and murdered by the Nationalists at the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>''[[The Oxford Companion to English Literature]]''</ref><ref>''Roy Campbell; Selected Poems'', Saint Austin Press, London, 2001. Pages 124\u2013134.</ref> In a self-deprecating poem titled \"On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca\", Campbell wrote,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nNot only did he lose his life\nBy shots assassinated:\nBut with a hammer and a knife\nWas after that\u2014translated.<ref>Roy Campbell, ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], 1955. Page 283. \"On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca.\"</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Death==\nRoy Campbell died in a car accident near [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal, on [[Easter Monday]], 1957. The Campbell's were returning home from attending [[Easter Sunday]] in [[Sevilla]].\n\nAccording to his daughter Anna Campbell Lyle, \"On the day, in fact at the very hour, that Father was dying in a car crash on a lonely road in [[Portugal]], I was buying a black coat at Simpson's in [[Piccadilly]]. It was 3:30 in the afternoon of the 23rd of April 1957 - the birthday and, according to tradition, also the death day of [[Shakespeare]]. The car my parents were travelling in, a small [[Fiat]] 300, had one very worn Tyre. Mary, my mother, who did all the driving, thought she had had this Tyre put at the back, but the mechanic made a mistake when servicing the car, and put it in front of the right hand side where my father sat. He was a big man and under his weight the tyre which had held out since Seville burst, and the car crashed into a tree on a lonely road near [[Setubal]], south of [[Lisbon]]. Both my parents were knocked unconscious instantly. Father was driven to a hospital at Setubal by some people who passed shortly after the accident. He died on the way, after murmuring some words and giving two deep sighs. Mother recovered after a long convalescence, but she was never the same, brave optimist again; though she did retain her sense of humour and enchantment. Certainly a part of her died with Father and she blamed herself for his death. This was nonsense; fate had joined them; fate had now separated them\".<ref>Anna and Teresa Campbell (2011), ''Remembering Roy Campbell: The Memoirs of His Daughters Anna and Tess'', [[Winged Lion Press]]. Edited by Judith L\u00fctge Coullie. Preface by [[Joseph Pearce]]. Page 1.</ref>\n\nAnna also writes, \"Mary was deeply religious and it was a great happiness to her to know that Father had died two days after receiving the [[Eucharist|Sacrament]] on [[Easter Sunday]], so that he was in a [[State (theology)|State of Grace]] when his soul left his body. Father was buried in the cemetery of Sao Pedro in [[Sintra]] (the Cintra of [[Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|Childe Harold]]'') on the 26th. I often go there to take flowers to his tomb in which Mary now lies. This is not to be their last resting place. The South Africans want their greatest poet to be buried in what was, when all is said, the part of the planet he loved most\". According to South African Campbell scholar Judith L\u00fctge Coullie, however, inquiries about efforts to move Roy and Mary Campbell's remains to South Africa \"have drawn a blank. It is unlikely, however, to be a priority in post-[[Apartheid]] South Africa\".<ref>Anna and Teresa Campbell (2011), page 3.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAt the time of his death, Campbell was working upon translations of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish plays. Although only the rough drafts were completed, Campbell's work was posthumously edited for publication by [[Eric Bentley]] under the title, ''Life Is a Dream and Other Spanish Classics''.\n\nCampbell's vocal attacks upon the [[Marxism]] and [[Freudianism]] popular among the British [[intelligentsia]] caused him to be a controversial figure during his own lifetime. It has been suggested by some critics and by his daughters in their memoirs that his support for [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]] has caused him to be labelled a [[Fascist]] and [[blacklist]]ed from modern poetry anthologies. Efforts have been made to restore Campbell's literary reputation. According to his daughters and his biographer [[Joseph Pearce]], the poet's opposition to the Spanish Republic was based on a belief that it was controlled by the Stalin's [[NKVD]] and on real experience with both [[Red Terror (Spain)|Republican war crimes]] and the [[religious persecution]] of Spain's [[Roman Catholic]] majority. Also according to Pearce, Campbell's verse satires, which his wife and daughters often begged him to stop writing, were modelled after similar satires composed centuries earlier by eminent poets [[John Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name=\"catholicauthors\">[http://www.catholicauthors.com/roy_campbell.html \"Roy Campbell: Bombast and Fire\" \u2013 Catholic Author\u2019s article]</ref><ref>Joseph Pearce, \"Introduction,\" in ''Roy Campbell: Selected Poems'' (London: Saint Austin Press, 2001), xxv</ref><ref>[http://spectator.org/archives/2009/10/12/a-dark-horse \"A Dark Horse\" ''American Spectator'']</ref>\n\nCampbell's translations of the French [[Symbolist]] poets [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]] have appeared in modern anthologies.\n\nAlso, in a 1968 lecture at [[Harvard University]], Campbell's translations of the Catholic mystical poetry of [[St. John of the Cross]] were lavishly praised by [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. Borges called Campbell, \"a great Scottish poet who is also South African\", and called his versions of St. John's poetry, in some ways, superior to the original poems in Spanish.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges, ''This Craft of Verse'', Harvard University Press, 2000. Pages 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Literary style==\n\nMuch of Campbell's verse was satirical and written in [[heroic couplets]], a form otherwise rare in 20th-century English verse. Rhymed verse was generally his favoured medium. One modern assessment of his poetry is that \"he was vigorous in all he wrote, but not distinctly original.\"<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', Bloomsbury: 1989</ref>\n\nThis is Campbell celebrating fertility and sexuality, in ''Anadyomene'' (1924):\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nMaternal Earth stirs redly from beneath\nHer blue sea-blanket and her quilt of sky,\nA giant Anadyomene from the sheath\nAnd chrysalis of darkness; till we spy\nHer vast barbaric haunches, furred with trees,\nStretched on the continents, and see her hair\nCombed in a surf of fire along the breeze\nTo curl about the dim sierras, where\nFaint snow-peaks catch the sun's far-swivelled beams:\nAnd, tinder to his rays, the mountain-streams\nKindle, and volleying with a thunderstroke\nOut of their roaring gullies, burst in smoke\nTo shred themselves as fine as women's hair,\nAnd hoop gay rainbows on the sunlit air.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nOn the subject of nature, Campbell produced poetry such as this in his ''The Zebras'' (1931):\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nFrom the dark woods that breathe of fallen showers,\nHarnessed with level rays in golden reins,\nThe zebras draw the dawn across the plains\nWading knee-deep among the scarlet flowers.\nThe sunlight, zithering their flanks with fire,\nFlashes between the shadows as they pass\nBarred with electric tremors through the grass\nLike wind along the gold strings of a lyre.\n\nInto the flushed air snorting rosy plumes\nThat smoulder round their feet in drifting fumes,\nWith dove-like voices call the distant fillies,\nWhile round the herds the stallion wheels his flight,\nEngine of beauty volted with delight,\nTo roll his mare among the trampled lilies.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''The Flaming Terrapin''
