The diplomats\u2014especially [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]], [[John Adams|Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]\u2014secured recognition of American independence and large loans to the new national government. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 was highly favorable to the United States which now could expand westward to the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] was a leading expert on diplomatic history. According to Jerold Combs:\n:Bemis's ''The Diplomacy of the American Revolution,'' published originally in 1935, is still the standard work on the subject. It emphasized the danger of American entanglement in European quarrels. European diplomacy in the eighteenth century was \"rotten, corrupt, and perfidious,\" warned Bemis. America's diplomatic success had resulted from staying clear of European politics while reaping advantage from European strife.  Franklin, Jay, and Adams had done just this during the Revolution and as a consequence had won the greatest victory in the annals of American diplomacy. Bemis conceded that the French alliance had been necessary to win the war. Yet he regretted that it had brought involvement with \"the baleful realm of European diplomacy.\" Vergennes [the French foreign minister] was quite willing to lead America to an \"abattoir\" [slaughterhouse] where portions of the United States might be dismembered if this would advance the interests of France.<ref>Jerald A.

In 1795 Washington supported the [[Jay Treaty]], designed by Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]] to avoid war with Britain and encourage commerce. The Jeffersonians vehemently opposed the treaty, but Washington's support proved decisive, and the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms for a decade.

President [[John Adams]] tried diplomacy; it failed. In 1798, the French demanded American diplomats pay huge bribes in order to see the French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]], which the Americans rejected. The Jeffersonian Republicans, suspicious of Adams, demanded the documentation, which Adams released using X, Y and Z as codes for the names of the French diplomats. The [[XYZ Affair]] ignited a wave of nationalist sentiment. Overwhelmed, the U.S. Congress approved Adams' plan to organize the navy. Adams reluctantly signed the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] as a wartime measure.

The [[War of 1812]] was marked by very bad planning and military fiascoes on both sides. It ended with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1815. Militarily it was a stalemate as both sides failed in their invasion attempts, but the Royal Navy blockaded the coastline and shut down American trade (except for smuggling supplies into British Canada).  However the British achieved their main goal of defeating Napoleon, while the American armies defeated the Indian alliance that the British had supported, ending the British war goal of establishing a pro-British Indian boundary nation in the Midwest. The British stopped impressing American sailors and trade with France (now an ally of Britain) resumed, so the causes of the war had been cleared away. Especially after the great American victory at the Battle of New Orleans, Americans felt proud and triumphant for having won their \"second war of independence.\"<ref>A.J.

The failure of Spain to colonize or police Florida led to its purchase by the U.S. in 1821.

Polk]] (1845\u20131849)]]\n\nIn 1846 after an intense political debate in which the expansionist Democrats prevailed over the Whigs, the U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas. Mexico never recognized that Texas had achieved independence and promised war should the U.S. annex it. President [[James K. Polk]] peacefully resolved a border dispute with Britain regarding Oregon, then sent U.S. Army patrols into the disputed area of Texas. That triggered the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], which the Americans won easily.  As a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848 the U.S. acquired territory that included California, Arizona  and New Mexico, and the Hispanic residents there were given full U.S. citizenship.<ref>David M. Pletcher, ''The Diplomacy of Annexation: Texas, Oregon, and the Mexican War'' (1973).</ref>\n\n===Nicaraguan canal===\nThe British wanted a stable Mexico to block American expansion to the Southwest, but an unstable Mexico attacked Texas and wanted revenge for its defeat. The result was a vast American expansion.  The discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought a heavy demand for passage to the gold fields, with the main routes crossing Panama to avoid a very long slow sailing voyage around all of South America. A railroad was built that carried 600,000 despite the dangerous environment in Panama. A canal in Nicaragua was a much more healthier and attractive possibility, and American businessman [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] gained the necessary permissions, along with a U.S. treaty with Nicaragua.  Britain had long dominated Central America, but American influence was growing, and the small countries look to the United States for protection against British imperialism.  However the British were determined to block an American canal, and seized key locations on the Miskito coast on the Atlantic that blocked it.  The  Whigs were in charge in Washington and unlike the bellicose Democrats wanted a business-like peaceful solution. The Whigs took a lesson from the British experience monopolizing  the chokepoint of Gibraltar, which produced no end of conflicts, wars, and military and naval expenses for the British. The United States decided that a canal should be open and neutral to all the world's traffic, and not be militarized. Tensions escalated locally, with small-scale physical confrontations in the field.<ref>Richard W. Van Alstyne, \"Anglo-American Relations, 1853\u20131857.\" ''American Historical Review'' 42.3 (1937): 491\u2013500.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] of 1850 Washington and London found a diplomatic solution. To avert an escalating clash it focused on a Nicaragua Canal that would connect the Pacific and the Atlantic. The three main treaty provisions stated that neither nation would build such a canal without the consent and  cooperation of the other; neither would fortify or found new colonies in the region; if and when a canal was built, both powers would guarantee that it would be available on a neutral basis for all shipping. However, disagreements arose and no Nicaragua canal was ever started, but the treaty remained in effect until 1901. By 1857\u201359, London dropped its opposition to American territorial expansion.<ref>Kenneth Bourne,  \"The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and the Decline of British Opposition to the Territorial Expansion of the United States, 1857\u201360.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 33.3 (1961): 287\u2013291.

Americans lost interest in canals and focused their attention on building long-distance railways. The British, meanwhile, turned their attention to building the Suez Canal through Egypt. London maintained a veto on American canal building in Nicaragua. In 1890s, the French made a major effort to build a canal through Panama, but it self-destructed through mismanagement, severe corruption, and especially the deadly disease environment. By the late 1890s Britain saw the need for much improved relations with the United States, and agreed to allow the U.S. to build a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama. The choice was Panama.  The [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty]] of 1901 replaced the Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty, and adopted the rule of neutralization for the [[Panama Canal]] which the U.S. built; it opened in 1914.<ref>Mary Wilhelmine Williams, ''Anglo-American isthmian diplomacy, 1815\u20131915''.

The primary obstacle was opposition from Congress. His ambitions centered around establishing U.S. hegemony over Central America at the expense of Great Britain.<ref>Elbert B. Smith, ''The Presidency of James Buchanan'' (1975) pp 69\u201370.</ref>  He hoped to re-negotiate the [[Clayton-Bulwer Treaty]], which he viewed as a mistake that limited U.S. influence in the region.

After long negotiations with the British, he convinced them to agree to cede the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] to [[Honduras]] and the [[Mosquito Coast]] to [[Nicaragua]]. However, Buchanan's ambitions in Cuba and Mexico were blocked in the House of Representatives where the anti-slavery forces strenuously opposed any move to acquire new slave territory. Buchanan was assisted by his ally Senator [[John Slidell]] (D.-Louisiana) But Senator Stephen Douglas, a bitter enemy of Buchanan inside the Democratic Party worked hard to frustrate Buchanan's foreign-policy.<ref>Jean H.

The [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (1858) granted American diplomats the right to reside in Peking, reduced tariff levels for American goods, and guaranteed the free exercise of religion by foreigners in China.

That marked a major diplomatic achievement for Secretary Seward and the Lincoln Administration. France, under [[Napoleon III]], had invaded Mexico and installed a puppet regime; it hoped to negate American influence.  France therefore encouraged Britain in a policy of mediation suggesting that both would recognize the Confederacy.<ref>Lynn M. Case, and Warren E. Spencer, ''The United States and France: Civil War Diplomacy'' (1970)</ref>  Lincoln repeatedly warned that meant war. The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South, but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics. Knowing a war would cut off vital shipments of American food, wreak havoc on the British merchant fleet, and cause the immediate loss of Canada, Britain, with its powerful Royal Navy, refused to go along with French schemes.<ref>Kinley J.

Diplomats had to explain that United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, but instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesman, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. In addition, the European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the and American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H. Doyle,  ''The Cause of All Nations: And international history of the American Civil War '' (2014) pp. 8 (quote), 69\u201370</ref>\n\nElite opinion in Britain tended to favor [[Confederate States of America|the Confederacy]], while public opinion tended to favor the United States. Large scale trade continued in both directions with the United States, with the Americans shipping grain to Britain while Britain sent manufactured items and munitions. Immigration continued into the United States. British trade with the Confederacy was limited, with a trickle of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small blockade runners. The Confederate strategy for securing independence was largely based on the hope of military intervention by Britain and France, but Confederate diplomacy proved inept.  With the announcement of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in September 1862, it became a war against slavery that most British supported.<ref>Howard Jones, ''Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: the Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War,'' (1999)</ref>\n\nA serious diplomatic dispute with the United States erupted over the \"[[Trent Affair]]\" in late 1861. Public opinion in the Union called for war against Britain, but Lincoln gave in and sent back the diplomats his Navy had illegally seized.<ref>Walter Stahr, ''Seward: Lincoln's Indispensable Man'' (2012) ch. 11</ref>\n\nBritish financiers built and operated most of the [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runner]]s, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on them; but that was legal and not the cause of serious tension. They were staffed by sailors and officers on leave from the Royal Navy.  When the U.S. Navy captured one of the fast blockade runners, it sold the ship and cargo as prize money for the American sailors, then released the crew.\n\nA long-term issue was the British shipyard ([[Cammell Laird|John Laird and Sons]]) building two warships for the Confederacy, including the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], over vehement protests from the United States. The controversy was resolved after the Civil War in the form of the [[Alabama Claims]], in which the United States finally was given $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by British-built warships.<ref>Frank J.  Merli,  ''The Alabama, British Neutrality, and the American Civil War.''

Blaine]], a leading Republican (and its losing candidate for president in 1884) was a highly innovative Secretary of State in the 1880s. By 1881, Blaine had completely abandoned his high-tariff [[Protectionism]] and used his position as Secretary of State to promote freer trade, especially within the Western Hemisphere.<ref>David M.

Secondly, he believed that by encouraging exports, he could increase American prosperity. President Garfield agreed with his Secretary of State's vision and Blaine called for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade.  At the same time, Blaine hoped to negotiate a peace in the [[War of the Pacific]] then being fought by [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]].  Blaine sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] to allow the United States to construct [[Panama Canal|a canal through Panama]] without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British involvement in the strategically located [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].<ref>David Healy, ''James G.

This began to change in 1893. By the early 1880s, the United States had a small army stationed at scattered Western forts, and an old fashioned wooden navy. By 1890 the U.S. began investment in new naval technology including steam-powered battleships with powerful armaments and steel decking.\n\nIn 1893 the business community in [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] overthrew the Queen and sought annexation by President [[Benjamin Harrison|Harrison]], who forwarded the proposal to the Senate for approval. But the newly elected President [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]] withdrew the proposed annexation; Hawaii formed an independent [[Republic of Hawaii]]. Unexpectedly foreign-policy became a central concern of American politics. Historian [[Henry Graff]] says that at first, \"Public opinion at home seemed to indicate acquiescence....\"Unmistakably, the sentiment at home was maturing with immense force for the United States to join the great powers of the world in a quest for overseas colonies.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry F.

His biographer Alyn Brodsky argues he was deeply adverse to an immoral action against the little kingdom :\n:Just as he stood up for the Samoan Islands against Germany because he opposed the conquest of a lesser state by a greater one, so did he stand up for the Hawaiian Islands against his own nation. He could have let the annexation of Hawaii move inexorably to its inevitable culmination. But he opted for confrontation, which he hated, as it was to him the only way a weak and defenseless people might retain their independence. It was not the idea of annexation that Grover Cleveland opposed, but the idea of annexation as a pretext for illicit territorial acquisition.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alyn Brodsky|title=Grover Cleveland: A Study in Character|publisher=Macmillan|url=https://archive.org/details/groverclevelands00brod|url-access=registration|year=2000|page=[https://archive.org/details/groverclevelands00brod/page/1 1]|isbn=9780312268831}}</ref>\n\nCleveland had to mobilize support from Southern Democrats to fight the treaty.  He sent former Georgia Congressman [[James H. Blount]] as a special representative to Hawaii to investigate and provide a solution. Blount was well known for his opposition to imperialism.  Blount was also a leader in the white supremacy movement that in the 1890s was [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|ending the right to vote by southern Blacks]].. Some observers speculated he would support annexation on grounds of the inability of the Asiatics to govern themselves. Instead, Blount opposed imperialism, and called for the US military to restore of Queen Liliuokalani. He argued that the Hawaii natives should be allowed to continue their \"Asiatic ways.\"<ref>Tennant S. McWilliams, \"James H.

The State Department had a cadre of diplomats who rotated around, but the most senior positions were political patronage appointments. The holders sometimes acquired a limited expertise, but the overall pool was shallow. At the level of presidential candidate and secretary of state, the entire half-century after 1850 showed minimal expertise or interest, with the exception of [[William Seward]] in the 1860s, and [[James G. Blaine]] in the 1880s. After 1900, experience deepened in the State Department, and at the very top level, Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Hoover and their secretaries of state comprised a remarkable group with deep knowledge of international affairs. American elections rarely featured serious discussion of foreign-policy, with a few exceptions such as 1910, 1916, 1920 and 1940.<ref>Thomas A.

The media relied primarily on a small number of foreign-policy experts based in New York City and Boston. Newspapers elsewhere copied their reports and editorials. Sometimes the regional media had a local cadre of experts who could comment on Europe, but they rarely had anyone who knew much about Latin America or Asia. Conceptually, the media experts relied on American traditions \u2013 what would Washington or Jefferson or Lincoln have done in this crisis?-- And what impact it might have on current business conditions. Social Darwinist ideas were broad, but they seldom shaped foreign-policy views. The psychic crisis that some historians discover in the 1890s had very little impact.

The U.S. increased pressure and was dissatisfied with Spanish responses.  When the American battleship the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} exploded for undetermined reasons in the harbor of [[Havana]], Cuba, on 15 February 1898, the issue became overwhelming and McKinley could not resist the demands for immediate action. Most Democrats and many Republicans demanded war to liberate Cuba. Almost simultaneously the two countries declared war. (Every other country was neutral.) The U.S. easily won the one-sided four-month-long [[Spanish\u2013American War]] from April through July. In the Treaty of Paris, the U.S. took over the last remnants of the Spanish Empire, notably [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Guam]].

The Army remained small but was reorganized in the [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] Administration along modern lines and no longer focused on scattered forts in the West. The [[Philippine\u2013American War]] was a short operation to suppress insurgents and ensure U.S. control of the islands; by 1907, however, interest in the Philippines as an entry to Asia faded in favor of the [[Panama Canal]], and American foreign policy centered on the Caribbean. The 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which proclaimed a right for the United States to intervene to stabilize weak states in the Americas, further weakened European influence in Latin America and further established U.S. regional hegemony.<ref>Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower'' (2008) chs. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910 ended a half century of peaceful borders and brought escalating tensions, as revolutionaries threatened American business interests and hundreds of thousands of refugees fled north.

After Mexico in 1917 rejected Germany's invitation in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] to join in war against the U.S., relations stabilized and there were no more interventions in Mexico. Military interventions did occur in other small countries like Nicaragua, but were ended by the [[Good Neighbor policy]] announced by President  [[Franklin D.

His chief advisor was \"Colonel\" Edward House, who was sent on many top-level missions. The United States [[Banana Wars|intervened militarily]] in many [[Latin American]] nations to protect U.S. interests, particularly the commercial interests of the American business community. President Wilson landed U.S. troops in Mexico in 1914, in [[Haiti]] in 1915, in the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1916, in Mexico a second time in 1916, and in Mexico several additional times before Wilson left office, in Cuba in 1917, and in [[Panama]] in 1918. Also, for most of the Wilson administration, the U.S. military occupied Nicaragua, installed a Nicaraguan president that the U.S. preferred, and ensured that the country signed treaties favorable to the U.S.<ref>[[James W. Loewen]], \"[[Lies My Teacher Told Me]]\" (New York: The New Press, 2018), p. 16</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of war in 1914, the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace. It insisted on its neutral rights, which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side. With the British blockade, there were almost no sales or loans to Germany, only to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. The widely publicized atrocities in Germany shocked American public opinion. Neutrality was supported by Irish-Americans, who hated Britain, by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral, and by women and the churches. It was supported by the more educated upscale [[White Anglo Saxon Protestant|WASP]] element, led by Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson insisted on neutrality, denouncing both British and German violations, especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed. The German U-boat torpedoed the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915. It sank in 20 minutes, killing 128 American civilians and over 1,000 Britons. It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats. American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerald A Combs|title=The History of American Foreign Policy: v.1: To 1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWRsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT325|year=2015|pages=325\u2013|isbn=9781317456377}}</ref> Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its [[U-boats]], but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare. It also made overtures to Mexico, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border. The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin, but by the military commanders and the Kaiser. They realized it meant war with the United States, but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports, and strike a winning blow with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front, where Russia had surrendered. Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917, Wilson asked Congress and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917. He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war with the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars. During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty, but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918. After the failure of the German spring offensive, as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day, the Germans were in a hopeless position, and thus surrendered. Coupled with Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918, the U.S. now had the initiative on the military, diplomatic and public relations fronts. [[Wilsonianism]]\u2014Wilson's ideals\u2014had become the hope of the world, including the civilian population Germany itself.<ref>[[John Milton Cooper]], ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) chs. 17\u201319</ref>\n\n====Invading Russia====\n{{Main|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nThe U.S. military together with forces of its [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invaded]] [[Russia]] in 1918. Approximately 250,000 invading soldiers, including troops from Europe, the US and the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Russia to aid the [[White Army]] against the [[Red Army]] of the new [[Soviet]] government in the [[Russian civil war]]. The invaders launched the [[North Russia Campaign|North Russia invasion]] from [[Arkhangelsk]] and the [[Allied Intervention in Siberia|Siberia invasion]] from [[Vladivostok]].  The invading forces included 13,000 U.S. troops whose mission after the end of World War I included the toppling of the new Soviet government and the restoration of the previous [[Tsarist regime]]. U.S. and other Western forces were unsuccessful in this aim and withdrew by 1920 but the Japanese military continued to occupy parts of [[Siberia]] until 1922 and the northern half of [[Sakhalin]] until 1925.<ref>Beyer, Rick, \"The Greatest Stories Never Told\" 2003: A&E Television Networks / The History Channel, pp. 152\u2013153, {{ISBN|0060014016}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Robert Maddox summarised, \"The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war, thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m23RrMeLt4C&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=robert+maddox,+russian+civil+war&source=bl&ots=e1ATvSmiWs&sig=_vHLd93fucLyfk0lnpIVkcbOCdc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3o__987PXAhXLMSYKHXneA90Q6AEIXDAO#v=onepage&q=robert%20maddox%2C%20russian%20civil%20war&f=false James W.

''The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment after Seventy-Five Years'' (1998)</ref> Wilson, however, refused to consult with [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]], who took control of Congress after the 1918 elections and which demanded revisions protecting the right of Congress to declare war. Wilson refused to compromise with the majority party in Congress, or even bring any leading Republican to the peace conference. His personal enemy, Henry Cabot Lodge, now control the Senate.  Lodge did support the league of Nations,  but wanted provisions that would insist that only Congress could declare war on behalf of the United States.  Wilson was largely successful in designing the new League of Nations, declaring it would be:\n:a great charter for a new order of affairs.  There is ground here for deep satisfaction, universal reassurance, and confident hope.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Milton Cooper|title=Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/breakingheartofw00coop|url-access=registration|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/breakingheartofw00coop/page/110 110]|isbn=9780521807869}}</ref>\nThe League did go into operation, but the United States never joined. With a two-thirds vote needed, the Senate did not ratify either the original Treaty or its Republican version. Washington made separate peace treaties with the different European nations. Nevertheless, Wilson's idealism and call for self-determination of all nations had an effect on nationalism across the globe, while at home his idealistic vision, called \"Wilsonianism\" of spreading democracy and peace under American auspices had a profound influence on much of American foreign policy ever since.<ref>Erez Manela, ''The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism'' (2007)</ref>\n\n==== Debate on Wilson's role====\nPerhaps the harshest attack on Wilson's diplomacy comes from Stanford historian [[Thomas A. Bailey]] in two books that remain heavily cited by scholars, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace'' (1944) and ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945), Bailey:\n:contended that Wilson's wartime isolationism, as well as his peace proposals at war's end, were seriously flawed. Highlighting the fact that American delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposed League of Nations, Bailey concluded that the president and his diplomatic staff essentially sold out, compromising important American ideals to secure mere fragments of Wilson's progressive vision. Hence, while Bailey primarily targeted President Wilson in these critiques, others, including House, did not emerge unscathed.<ref>Scot D. Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House: The Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\" '' Reviews in American History'' 45#4 (2017) pp 623\u201324.</ref>\n\nScot Bruce argues that:\n:More recently, prominent historians such as Thomas J. Knock, [[Arthur Walworth]], and [[John Milton Cooper]], among others, shied away from condemning Wilson and his peacemakers for extensive diplomatic failures in Paris. Instead, they framed Wilsonian progressivism, articulated through the League of Nations, as a comparatively enlightened framework tragically undermined by British and French machinations at the peace conference.&nbsp;... Historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], continued this analytical trend in her prize-winning book, ''Paris, 1919: Six Months That Changed the World'' (2001), which characterized Wilson as the frustrated idealist, unable to secure his progressive vision due to opposition from old-guard imperialists in his midst. While realists like Lloyd E. Ambrosius questioned the merits of defining Wilsonian progressivism too idealistically, the idea has persisted that well-intentioned U.S. delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposals in Paris, and therefore compromised under pressure. Even the great Wilson scholar, [[Arthur S. Link]], subscribed to a version of this narrative.<ref>Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House: The Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\"  (2017) p. 624.</ref>\n\n===Interwar years, 1921\u20131933===\n{{See also|International relations (1919\u20131939)|Roaring Twenties}}\n\nIn the 1920s, American policy was an active involvement in international affairs, while ignoring the League of Nations, setting up numerous diplomatic ventures, and using the enormous financial power of the United States to dictate major diplomatic questions in Europe.

The key Republican leaders:\n: including [[Elihu Root]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and Hoover himself, were Progressives who accepted much of Wilson's internationalism....

The [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in 1923 Caused an international crisis; Germany deliberately hyperinflated currency, making the occupation highly expensive for France.  The crisis was solved by a compromise brokered by the United States in the form of the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924.<ref>Patrick O.

France, Britain and the other countries used the reparations in turn to repay wartime loans they received from the United States. By 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the [[Young Plan]] that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks ({{USD|26.3 billion}}) and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were [[Hoover Moratorium|suspended for a year]] and in 1932 during the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]] they were suspended indefinitely.

This was in line with both American neutrality policies, and with [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|a Europe-wide agreement to not sell arms for use in the Spanish war lest it escalate into a world war.]] Congress endorsed the embargo by a near-unanimous vote.  Only armaments were embargoed; American companies could sell oil and supplies to both sides.   Roosevelt quietly favored the left-wing Republican (or \"Loyalist\") government, but intense pressure by American Catholics forced him to maintain a policy of neutrality. The Catholics were outraged by the systematic torture, rape and execution of priests, bishops, and nuns by anarchist elements of the Loyalist coalition.  This successful pressure on Roosevelt was one of the handful of foreign policy successes notched by Catholic pressures on the White House in the 20th century.<ref>J.

Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General John J. Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \"[[Europe first]]\" strategy.

The basic reason was that the Japanese plans were a  very closely held secret.   The attack fleet kept radio silence and was not spotted by anyone en route to Hawaii.  There were air patrols over Hawaii, but they were too few and too ineffective to scan a vast ocean.  Japan Navy spread false information\u2014using fake radio signals\u2014to indicate the main fleet was in Japanese waters, and suggested their main threat was north toward Russia.  The U.S. had [[Magic (cryptography)|MAGIC]], which successfully cracked the Japanese diplomatic code. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry and its diplomats were deliberately never told about the upcoming attack, so American intelligence was wasting its time trying to discover secrets through MAGIC  American intelligence expected attacks against British and Dutch possessions, and were looking for those clues.  At Pearl Harbor, they focused on predicting local sabotage. There was no overall American intelligence center\u2014the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was formed during this time. In 1941 no one coordinated the masses of information coming in from the Army, Navy, and State department, and from British and Dutch allies.  The system of notification was flawed, so the what the sender thought was an urgent message did not appear urgent to the recipient.  After the attack, congressional investigators identify and link together all sorts of small little signals pointing to an attack, while they discarded  signals pointing in other directions.  Even in hindsight  there was so much confusion, noise, and poor coordination  that Wohlstetter concludes no accurate predictions of the attack on Pearl Harbor was at all likely before December 7.<ref>Roberta Wohlstetter, ''Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision'' (1962).</ref><ref>Lt-Col Robert F.

American policy substantially favored Britain and its allies, and the U.S. getting caught up in the war. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through [[Lend-lease|Lend-Lease]]. Industries greatly expanded to produce war materials. The United States officially entered World War II against Germany, Japan, and Italy in December 1941, following the Japanese surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. This time the U.S. was a full-fledged member of the [[Allies of World War II]], not just an \"associate\" as in the first war.  During the war, the U.S. conducted military operations on both the Atlantic and Pacific fronts. After the war and devastation of its European and Asian rivals, the United States found itself in a uniquely powerful position due to the lack of damage to its domestic industries.\n\n===Postwar peace===\n{{Further|Foreign policy of the Harry S.

It was Franklin Roosevelt policy to establish a new international organization that would be much more effective than the old League of Nations, and avoid its flaws.  He successfully sponsored the formation of the United Nations.\n\nThe United States was a major force in establishing the [[United Nations]] in 1945, hosting a meeting of fifty nations in San Francisco. Avoiding the rancorous debates of 1919, where there was no veto, the US and the Soviet Union, as well as Britain, France and China, became permanent members of the [[Security Council]] with veto power. The idea of the U.N. was to promote world peace through consensus among nations, with boycotts, sanctions and even military power exercised by the Security Council. It depended on member governments for funds and had difficulty funding its budget.  In 2009, its $5 billion budget was funded using a complex formula based on [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]; the U.S. contributed 20% in 2009. However, the United Nations' vision of peace soon became jeopardized as the international structure was rebalanced with the development and testing of nuclear weapons by major powers.\n\n==Cold War: 1947\u20131991==\n{{Main|Cold War}}\n[[File:Cold War Map 1980.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Map of [[Cold War]] alliances in 1980, with [[NATO]] and other U.S. allies in blue, the [[Warsaw Pact]] and allies of the [[Soviet Union]] in red or pink, [[China]] and its allies in yellow, and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned nations]] in light blue]]\n\n===Truman and Eisenhower===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of the Harry S. Truman administration|Foreign policy of the Dwight D.

There was no large-scale fighting but instead numerous regional wars as well as the  ever-present threat of a catastrophic nuclear war.<ref>Ralph B.

Stalin vetoed any participation by East European nations.  A similar program was operated by the United States to restore the Japanese economy.  The U.S. actively sought allies, which it subsidized with military and economic \"foreign aid\", as well as diplomatic support. The main diplomatic initiative was the establishment of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949, committing the United States to nuclear defense of Western Europe, which engaged in a military buildup under NATO's supervision. The result was peace in Europe, coupled with the fear of Soviet invasion and a reliance on American protection.<ref>Mark J. Smith, ''NATO Enlargement During the Cold War: Strategy and System in the Western Alliance'' (2000).</ref>  In the 1950s, a number of other less successful regional alliances were developed by the United States,  such as the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO).  Economic and propaganda warfare against the communist world was part of the American toolbox.<ref>Shu Guang Zhang, ''Economic Cold War: America\u2019s Embargo Against China and the Sino-Soviet Alliance, 1949\u20131963'' (2002),</ref>  The United States operated a worldwide network of bases for its Army, Navy and Air Force, with large contingents stationed in Germany, Japan and South Korea.<ref>Kent E. Calder, ''Embattled garrisons: Comparative base politics and American globalism'' (2010).</ref>\n\nMost nations aligned with either the Western or Eastern camp, but after 1960 the Soviets broke with China as the Communist movement worldwide became divided. Some countries, such as India and Yugoslavia, tried to be neutral. Rejecting the [[rollback]] of Communism by force because it risked nuclear war, Washington developed a new strategy called [[containment]] to oppose the spread of [[communism]]. The containment policy was developed by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] in 1947. Kennan characterized the [[Soviet Union]] as an aggressive, anti-Western power that necessitated containment, a characterization which would shape US foreign policy for decades to come. The idea of containment was to match Soviet aggression with force wherever it occurred while not using [[nuclear weapons]]. The policy of containment created a bipolar, zero-sum world where the ideological conflicts between the Soviet Union and the United States dominated geopolitics. Due to the antagonism on both sides and each countries' search for security, a tense worldwide contest developed between the two states as the two nations' governments vied for global supremacy militarily, culturally, and influentially.\n\nThe Cold War was characterized by a lack of global wars but a persistence of regional [[proxy war]]s, often fought between client states and proxies of the United States and Soviet Union. The [[Covert United States foreign regime change actions|US also intervened]] in the affairs of other countries through a number of secret operations.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Containment policy seeking to stop Soviet expansion, involved the United States and its allies in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), a stalemate. Even longer and more disastrous was the  [[Vietnam War]] (1963\u201375).

Kennedy|Kennedy]] meeting with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] foreign minister Gromyko in 1962. Kennedy knew about Soviet missiles in Cuba but had not revealed this information yet. The Cuban Missile crisis brought the world close to the brink of [[World War III]] but luckily cooler heads prevailed.]]\n\nThe Cold War reached its most dangerous point during the Kennedy administration in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, and lasted for thirteen days. It was the moment when the Cold War was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations. Kennedy decided not to invade or bomb Cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island. The crisis ended in a compromise, with the Soviets removing their missiles publicly, and the United States secretly removing its nuclear missiles in Turkey.  In Moscow, Communist leaders removed [[Nikita Khrushchev]] because of his reckless behavior.<ref>Don Munton and David A. Welch, ''The Cuban Missile Crisis: A Concise History'' (2006)</ref>\n\nVietnam and the Cold War are the two major issues that faced the Kennedy presidency. Historians disagree. However, there is general scholarly agreement that his presidency was successful on a number of lesser issues. Thomas Paterson finds that the Kennedy administration helped quiet the crisis over Laos;  was suitably cautious about the Congo; liberalized trade; took the lead in humanitarianism especially with the Peace Corps; helped solve a nasty dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands; achieve the Limited Test Man Treaty; created a new Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; defended Berlin; and strengthened European defenses. His willingness to negotiate with Khrushchev smoothed the Berlin crisis, and Kennedy's personal diplomacy earned him the respect of Third World leaders.<ref>Thomas G. Patterson, ed., ''Kennedy's Quest for Victory: American Foreign Policy 1961-1963'' (1989) p 19.</ref>\n\nOn the two major issues, no consensus has been reached. Michael L. Krenn argues in 2017:\n:Fifty-some years after his assassination, John F. Kennedy remains an enigma. Was he the brash and impulsive president who brought the world to the brink of World War III with the Cuban Missile Crisis? Or was he the brave challenger of the American military-industrial complex who would have prevented the Vietnam War? Various studies portray him as a Cold War liberal, or a liberal Cold Warrior, or come up with pithy phrases to summarize the man and his foreign policy.<ref>Michael L. Krenn, \"Kennedy, Johnson, and the Nonaligned World,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (2017) 47#1 p 219.</ref>\n\nThe [[Containment]] policy meant fighting communist expansion where ever it occurred, and the Communists aimed where the American allies were weakest. When he became president in November 1963, Lyndon Johnson's primary commitment was to his domestic policy, so he tried to minimize public awareness and congressional oversight of the operations in the war.<ref>Gary Donaldson, ''America at war since 1945'' (1996) p. 96</ref> Most of his advisers were pessimistic about the long term possibilities, and Johnson feared that if Congress took control, it would demand \"Why Not Victory\", as [[Barry Goldwater]] put it, rather than containment.<ref>Niels Bjerre-Poulsen, ''Right face: organizing the American conservative movement 1945\u201365'' (2002) p. 267</ref>  American  Boots on the ground in Vietnam skyrocketed  from 16,000 soldiers in 1963 to over 500,000 in 1968, plus many others in support roles outside Vietnam. Johnson refused to allow the trained men of the Army reserves or the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to serve in Vietnam, because that would involve Congressional oversight. Instead he relied increasingly on the draft, which became increasingly unpopular.  With college deferments from the draft widely available, out of the 2.5 million Americans who served in Vietnam (out of 27 million Americans eligible to serve in the military) 80% came from poor and working-class backgrounds.<ref>{{cite book|author=John E.

South Vietnam had a large Well-equipped army, but it left nearly all the fighting to the Americans. In February 1968 the Viet Cong launched an all-out attack on South Vietnamese forces across the country in the [[Tet Offensive]]. The ARVN (South Vietnam's army) successfully fought off the attacks and reduced the [[Viet Cong]] to a state of ineffectiveness;  thereafter, it was the army of North Vietnam that was the main opponent.<ref>Mark W. Woodruff, ''Unheralded Victory: The Defeat of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army, 1961\u20131973'' (2006) p. 56</ref>  However the Tet Offensive proved a public relations disaster for Johnson, as the public increasingly realized the United States was deeply involved in a war that few people understood.  [[File:My Lai massacre.jpg|thumb|right|Civilians shot by American soldiers in the [[:My Lai massacre]].]]\nStarting in 1964, [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|the antiwar movement began.]]  Some opposed the war on moral grounds, rooting for the peasant Vietnamese against the modernizing capitalistic Americans. Opposition was centered among the black activists of the civil rights movement, and college students at elite universities.<ref>Charles DeBenedetti, ''An American Ordeal: The Antiwar Movement of the Vietnam Era'' (1990)</ref> Republicans, such as California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], demanded victory or withdrawal, while on the left strident demands for immediate withdrawal escalated.<ref>Herbert Y.

Moscow and Beijing went along, and accepted Nixon's terms of pulling their support away from Vietnam. This allowed Nixon to turn that war over to the government of South Vietnam, withdrawing all American and Allied troops, while continuing a bombing threat.

Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of [[West Pakistan]] would risk Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. To demonstrate to China the ''bona fides'' of the United States as an ally, and in direct defiance of the US Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan.

He insisted that the President make [[Paul Warnke]] Director of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], over strong opposition by Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]].  The firecest debates came over continuing d\u00e9tente policies with Moscow.  Vance tried to advance arms limitations by working on the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] agreement with the Soviet Union, which he saw as the central diplomatic issue of the time, but Brzezinski lobbied for a tougher more assertive policy vis-a-vis the Soviets. He argued for strong condemnation of Soviet activity in Africa and in the Third World as well as successfully lobbying for normalized relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1978. Brzezinski took control of the negotiations with Beijing. Vance was marginalized and his influence began to wane.

Vance argued in favor of demanding reforms while Brzezinski urged the Shah to crack down.

Bush]] to combat what was seen to be the growing trend of fundamentalist [[terrorism]] in the Middle East. The United States declared a ''[[War on Terrorism]]''. This policy dominated U.S. foreign policy over the last decade as the nation embarked on two military campaigns in the Middle East, in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Although both campaigns attracted international support, particularly the fighting in Afghanistan, the scale and duration of the war has lessened the motivation of American allies. Furthermore, when no [[weapons of mass destruction|WMDs]] were found after a military conquest of Iraq, there was worldwide skepticism that the war had been fought to prevent terrorism, and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] has had serious negative public relations consequences for the image of the United States. The \"[[Bush Doctrine]]\" shifted diplomatic and security policy toward maximizing the spread of liberal political institutions and democratic values. The policy has been called \"democratic realism,\" \"national security liberalism,\" \"democratic globalism,\" or \"messianic universalism.\" The policy helped inspire democratic upheavals in the Middle East.<ref>Jonathan Monten, \"The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.s.

While the United States remains a strong power economically and militarily, rising nations such as China, India, and Brazil as well as Russia have challenged its dominance. Foreign policy analysts such as Nina Harchigian suggest that the six emerging big powers share common concerns: free trade, economic growth, prevention of terrorism, efforts to stymie nuclear proliferation. And if they can avoid war, the coming decades can be peaceful and productive provided there are no misunderstandings or dangerous rivalries.\n\nIn his first formal television interview as president, [[Barack Obama]] addressed the Muslim world through an Arabic-language satellite TV network and expressed a commitment to repair relations that have deteriorated under the previous administration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090127/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_obama_mideast|title=Obama tells Arabic network US is 'not your enemy'|last=Schemm|first=Paul|date=27 January 2009|publisher=Yahoo!

Jefferson called for an empire of liberty, with the United States showing the way to Republicanism. Efforts to seize or Purchase colonies in  Latin America were rejected in the 1850s. In 1898\u20131900 there was a fierce debate by [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]]  Who formed a special-purpose lobby the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]] to fight against taking control of the Philippines after Spain left the scene.<ref>Fred H. Harrington, \"The Anti-Imperialist Movement in the United States, 1898\u20131900,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review,'' 22#2 (1935), pp.&nbsp;211\u2013230. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1898467 in JSTOR]</ref> The chief proponents of going to war in response to the cruelty of the Spanish Empire \u2013 most notably William Jennings Bryan \u2013 insisted the United States should not follow in the same footsteps. The opponents of declaring war, led by President McKinley, decided that America had responsibilities and insisted on taking the Philippines. Congress made the decision not to take ownership of Cuba. Any excitement about becoming an imperial power was short-lived, however, and by 1905 expansionary interests under Theodore Roosevelt turned away from  Asia and began focusing on the Panama Canal. The Democrats decided by 1934 to make the Philippines independent, which was done in 1946. Hawaii became integrated into the United States, and no one could decide \u2013 to this day \u2013 on the long-term status of Puerto Rico.<ref>Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) pp 264, 287, 306.</ref>\n\nHowever, during the Cold War, and especially after 9/11, critics have charged that the United States has become a worldwide empire  on its own. In 1945 the United States was planning to withdraw all its forces from Europe as soon as possible, but the Soviet actions in Poland and Czechoslovakia And especially in Greece forced a rethinking. Heavily influenced by [[George Kennan]], Washington policymakers decided that the Soviet Union was an expansionary dictatorship  that threatened American interests. Moscow's weakness was that it had to keep expanding to survive, and that by containing or stopping its growth stability could be achieved in Europe. The result was the Truman Doctrine (1947) regarding Greece and Turkey. A second equally important consideration was the need to restore the world economy, which required rebuilding and reorganizing Europe for growth. This issue, more than the Soviet threat, was the main impetus behind the Marshall Plan of 1948. A third factor was the realization, especially by Britain and the three Benelux nations, that American military involvement was needed. Historians have commented on the importance of \"the eagerness with which America's friendship with sought and its leadership welcomed.&nbsp;... In Western Europe, America built an empire 'by invitation'-\u2013 in the striking phrase coined by [[Geir Lundestad]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=John Darwin|title=After Tamerlane: The Rise and Fall of Global Empires, 1400\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z12AiODd8kC&pg=PA470|year=2010|page=470|isbn=9781596917606}}</ref><ref>\"If this American expansion created what we could call an American empire, this was to a large extent an empire by invitation.\" Geir Lundestad, \"Empire by Invitation?

Hopkins, ''American Empire: a Global History'' (2019).</ref>  He argues that by the 21st century traditional economic imperialism was no longer in play, noting that the oil companies  opposed the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Instead, anxieties about The negative impact of globalization on rural and rust-belt America were at work says Hopkins:\n:These anxieties prepared the way for a conservative revival based on family, faith and flag that enabled the neo-conservatives to transform conservative patriotism into assertive nationalism after 9/11. In the short term, the invasion of Iraq was a manifestation of national unity. Placed in a longer perspective, it reveals a growing divergence between new globalised interests, which rely on cross-border negotiation, and insular nationalist interests, which seek to rebuild fortress America.<ref>Anthony G. Hopkins,  \"[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03086530601143412 Capitalism, nationalism and the new American empire].\" ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 35.1 (2007): 95-117, quoting page 95.</ref>\n\nIn 2001\u20132010 numerous scholars debated the \"America as Empire\" issue.<ref>A. G. Hopkins \"Comparing British and American empires\" ''Journal of Global History'' (2007) 2#3 pp. 395-404.</ref>  Conservative Harvard professor [[Niall Ferguson]] concludes that Worldwide military and economic power have combined to make the U.S. the most powerful empire in history. It is a good idea he thinks, because like the successful British Empire in the 19th century it works to globalize free markets, enhanced the rule of law and promote representative government. He fears, however,  that Americans lack the long-term commitment in  manpower and money to keep the Empire operating.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire'' (2004), [https://www.amazon.com/Colossus-Rise-Fall-American-Empire/dp/0143034790 excerpt]</ref>\n\nMany \u2013 perhaps most \u2013 scholars have decided that that the United States lacks the key essentials of an empire. For example, while there are American military bases all over, the American soldiers do not rule over the local people, and the United States government does not send out governors or permanent settlers like all the historic empires did.<ref>Nugent, ''Habits of Empire'' p 287.</ref>  Harvard historian [[Charles S. Maier]] has examined the America-as-Empire issue at length.  He says the traditional understanding of the word \"empire\" does not apply because the United States does not exert formal control over other nations nor engage in systematic conquest. The best term is that the United States is a \"hegemon.\" Its enormous influence through high technology, economic power, and impact on popular culture gives it an international outreach that stands in sharp contrast to the inward direction of historic empires.<ref>Charles S. Maier, ''Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors'' (2006).</ref><ref>Grace Vuoto, \"The Anglo-American Global Imperial Legacy: Is There a Better Way?\" ''Canadian Journal of History,'' (2007) 42#2, 259-70.</ref>\n\nWorld historian [[Anthony Pagden]] asks is the United States really an empire? \n:I think if we look at the history of the European empires, the answer must be no. It is often assumed that because America possesses the military capability to become an empire, any overseas interest it does have must necessarily be imperial.&nbsp;... In a number of crucial respects, the United States is, indeed, very un-imperial.&nbsp;... America bears not the slightest resemblance to ancient Rome. Unlike all previous European empires, it has no significant overseas settler populations in any of its formal dependencies and no obvious desire to acquire any.&nbsp;... It exercises no direct rule anywhere outside these areas, and it has always attempted to extricate itself as swiftly as possible from anything that looks as if it were about to develop into even in direct rule.<ref>Anthony Pagden, \"Imperialism, liberalism & the quest for perpetual peace, ''Daedalus'' 134.2 (2005): 46-57, quoting pp 52-53.

However a diplomat needed a wife\u2014As senior officials gauge the competence of a budding diplomat in terms of his wife's 'Commanding Beauty' and 'Gentle Charm'. It was essential for her to project the proper image of American society by maintaining a proper upper-class household full of servants, entertaining guests and dignitaries, and even taking part in informal information intelligence gathering.<ref>Molly M. Wood, \"'Commanding Beauty' and 'Gentle Charm': American Women and Gender in the Early Twentieth-Century Foreign Service.\" Diplomatic History 31.3 (2007): 505\u2013530.</ref>  The wife had to relate well to the high society lifestyle of European diplomacy. Family money helped a great deal, given the modest pay scales of the American diplomatic service, and the limited entertainment budgets. Extremely rich diplomats had an advantage, such as [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, 1938\u201340.  His numerous children were considered suitable spouses for  British aristocrats.  In 1944, his daughter [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]] married [[William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington|Billy Cavendish]], the Marquess of Hartington and elder son of the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], the head of one of England's most aristocratic families.\n\n[[Frances E. Willis]] (1899\u20131983) was a famous pioneer. She joined the foreign service after earning a PhD in political science from Stanford. She was the third woman in the foreign service, and practically all her postings were \"firsts\"\u2014the first woman ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]'', the first woman appointed deputy chief of mission, the first female Foreign Service officer (FSO) appointed ambassador, the first woman to serve as ambassador to three posts, the first woman appointed Career Minister in 1955 and the first woman appointed Career Ambassador in 1962. She was posted to Chile, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Britain, and Finland as well as the State Department. In 1953, she became the first woman American ambassador (to Switzerland) and later served as ambassasor to Norway and Ceylon. Her biographer credits her competence, Language skills, research abilities, hard work, and self-confidence, as well as mentoring from the undersecretary of state, Joseph Grew, and Ambassador Hugh Gibson.<ref>Philip Nash, \"'A Woman's Touch in Foreign Affairs'? The Career of Ambassador Frances E. Willis\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' (2002) 13#2 pp 1\u201319.</ref>\n\nSince the late 20th century, high-profile ambassadorships typically are selected by the White House and go to prominent political or financial supporters of the president. These amateurs are mostly sent to Western Europe or nations with strong economic ties to the U.S. Professional career ambassadors move up through the State Department hierarchy and typically are posted to smaller countries and those with lower trade with the United States. The vast majority of semiprofessional diplomats were appointed to the most powerful countries.<ref>Costel Calin,  and Kathy R. Fitzpatrick, \"Diplomatic Amateurs or Qualified Professionals?

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 was highly favorable to the United States which now could expand westward to the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] was a leading expert on diplomatic history. According to Jerold Combs:\n:Bemis's ''The Diplomacy of the American Revolution,'' published originally in 1935, is still the standard work on the subject. It emphasized the danger of American entanglement in European quarrels. European diplomacy in the eighteenth century was \"rotten, corrupt, and perfidious,\" warned Bemis. America's diplomatic success had resulted from staying clear of European politics while reaping advantage from European strife.  Franklin, Jay, and Adams had done just this during the Revolution and as a consequence had won the greatest victory in the annals of American diplomacy. Bemis conceded that the French alliance had been necessary to win the war. Yet he regretted that it had brought involvement with \"the baleful realm of European diplomacy.\" Vergennes [the French foreign minister] was quite willing to lead America to an \"abattoir\" [slaughterhouse] where portions of the United States might be dismembered if this would advance the interests of France.<ref>Jerald A.

It was soon renamed the ''Department of State'' and changed the title of secretary for foreign affairs to Secretary of State; [[Thomas Jefferson]] returned from France to take the position.\n\nWhen the French Revolution led to war in 1793 between Britain (America's leading trading partner), and France (the old ally, with a treaty still in effect), Washington and his cabinet decided on a policy of neutrality. In 1795 Washington supported the [[Jay Treaty]], designed by Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]] to avoid war with Britain and encourage commerce. The Jeffersonians vehemently opposed the treaty, but Washington's support proved decisive, and the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms for a decade.

President [[John Adams]] tried diplomacy; it failed. In 1798, the French demanded American diplomats pay huge bribes in order to see the French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]], which the Americans rejected. The Jeffersonian Republicans, suspicious of Adams, demanded the documentation, which Adams released using X, Y and Z as codes for the names of the French diplomats. The [[XYZ Affair]] ignited a wave of nationalist sentiment. Overwhelmed, the U.S. Congress approved Adams' plan to organize the navy. Adams reluctantly signed the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] as a wartime measure. Adams broke with the Hamiltonian wing of his [[Federalist Party]] and made peace with France in 1800.<ref>Alexander De Conde, ''The quasi-war: the politics and diplomacy of the undeclared war with France 1797\u20131801'' (1996).</ref>\n\n==Jeffersonian Era: 1801\u20131829== \n\n{{Main|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1801\u20131829}}\n{{see also|Jeffersonian democracy}}\n[[File:Official Presidential portrait of Thomas Jefferson (by Rembrandt Peale, 1800)(cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Thomas Jefferson]] imagined the United States as the force behind an \"Empire of Liberty\" that would promote [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]]]\n\nThomas Jefferson envisioned America as the force behind a great \"Empire of Liberty\",<ref>Robert W.

The [[War of 1812]] was marked by very bad planning and military fiascoes on both sides. It ended with the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1815. Militarily it was a stalemate as both sides failed in their invasion attempts, but the Royal Navy blockaded the coastline and shut down American trade (except for smuggling supplies into British Canada).  However the British achieved their main goal of defeating Napoleon, while the American armies defeated the Indian alliance that the British had supported, ending the British war goal of establishing a pro-British Indian boundary nation in the Midwest. The British stopped impressing American sailors and trade with France (now an ally of Britain) resumed, so the causes of the war had been cleared away.

Mexico never recognized that Texas had achieved independence and promised war should the U.S. annex it. President [[James K. Polk]] peacefully resolved a border dispute with Britain regarding Oregon, then sent U.S. Army patrols into the disputed area of Texas. That triggered the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], which the Americans won easily.  As a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848 the U.S. acquired territory that included California, Arizona  and New Mexico, and the Hispanic residents there were given full U.S. citizenship.<ref>David M. Pletcher, ''The Diplomacy of Annexation: Texas, Oregon, and the Mexican War'' (1973).</ref>\n\n===Nicaraguan canal===\nThe British wanted a stable Mexico to block American expansion to the Southwest, but an unstable Mexico attacked Texas and wanted revenge for its defeat. The result was a vast American expansion.  The discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought a heavy demand for passage to the gold fields, with the main routes crossing Panama to avoid a very long slow sailing voyage around all of South America. A railroad was built that carried 600,000 despite the dangerous environment in Panama. A canal in Nicaragua was a much more healthier and attractive possibility, and American businessman [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] gained the necessary permissions, along with a U.S. treaty with Nicaragua.  Britain had long dominated Central America, but American influence was growing, and the small countries look to the United States for protection against British imperialism.  However the British were determined to block an American canal, and seized key locations on the Miskito coast on the Atlantic that blocked it.  The  Whigs were in charge in Washington and unlike the bellicose Democrats wanted a business-like peaceful solution. The Whigs took a lesson from the British experience monopolizing  the chokepoint of Gibraltar, which produced no end of conflicts, wars, and military and naval expenses for the British. The United States decided that a canal should be open and neutral to all the world's traffic, and not be militarized. Tensions escalated locally, with small-scale physical confrontations in the field.<ref>Richard W.

To avert an escalating clash it focused on a Nicaragua Canal that would connect the Pacific and the Atlantic. The three main treaty provisions stated that neither nation would build such a canal without the consent and  cooperation of the other; neither would fortify or found new colonies in the region; if and when a canal was built, both powers would guarantee that it would be available on a neutral basis for all shipping. However, disagreements arose and no Nicaragua canal was ever started, but the treaty remained in effect until 1901. By 1857\u201359, London dropped its opposition to American territorial expansion.<ref>Kenneth Bourne,  \"The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and the Decline of British Opposition to the Territorial Expansion of the United States, 1857\u201360.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 33.3 (1961): 287\u2013291.

Americans lost interest in canals and focused their attention on building long-distance railways. The British, meanwhile, turned their attention to building the Suez Canal through Egypt. London maintained a veto on American canal building in Nicaragua. In 1890s, the French made a major effort to build a canal through Panama, but it self-destructed through mismanagement, severe corruption, and especially the deadly disease environment. By the late 1890s Britain saw the need for much improved relations with the United States, and agreed to allow the U.S. to build a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama. The choice was Panama.  The [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty]] of 1901 replaced the Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty, and adopted the rule of neutralization for the [[Panama Canal]] which the U.S. built; it opened in 1914.<ref>Mary Wilhelmine Williams, ''Anglo-American isthmian diplomacy, 1815\u20131915''.

However, Buchanan's ambitions in Cuba and Mexico were blocked in the House of Representatives where the anti-slavery forces strenuously opposed any move to acquire new slave territory.

The [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (1858) granted American diplomats the right to reside in Peking, reduced tariff levels for American goods, and guaranteed the free exercise of religion by foreigners in China.

That marked a major diplomatic achievement for Secretary Seward and the Lincoln Administration. France, under [[Napoleon III]], had invaded Mexico and installed a puppet regime; it hoped to negate American influence.  France therefore encouraged Britain in a policy of mediation suggesting that both would recognize the Confederacy.<ref>Lynn M. Case, and Warren E. Spencer, ''The United States and France: Civil War Diplomacy'' (1970)</ref>  Lincoln repeatedly warned that meant war. The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South, but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics. Knowing a war would cut off vital shipments of American food, wreak havoc on the British merchant fleet, and cause the immediate loss of Canada, Britain, with its powerful Royal Navy, refused to go along with French schemes.<ref>Kinley J.

Diplomats had to explain that United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, but instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesman, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. In addition, the European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the and American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H.

Large scale trade continued in both directions with the United States, with the Americans shipping grain to Britain while Britain sent manufactured items and munitions. Immigration continued into the United States. British trade with the Confederacy was limited, with a trickle of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small blockade runners. The Confederate strategy for securing independence was largely based on the hope of military intervention by Britain and France, but Confederate diplomacy proved inept.  With the announcement of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in September 1862, it became a war against slavery that most British supported.<ref>Howard Jones, ''Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: the Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War,'' (1999)</ref>\n\nA serious diplomatic dispute with the United States erupted over the \"[[Trent Affair]]\" in late 1861.

They were staffed by sailors and officers on leave from the Royal Navy.  When the U.S. Navy captured one of the fast blockade runners, it sold the ship and cargo as prize money for the American sailors, then released the crew.\n\nA long-term issue was the British shipyard ([[Cammell Laird|John Laird and Sons]]) building two warships for the Confederacy, including the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], over vehement protests from the United States. The controversy was resolved after the Civil War in the form of the [[Alabama Claims]], in which the United States finally was given $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by British-built warships.<ref>Frank J.

Secondly, he believed that by encouraging exports, he could increase American prosperity. President Garfield agreed with his Secretary of State's vision and Blaine called for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade.  At the same time, Blaine hoped to negotiate a peace in the [[War of the Pacific]] then being fought by [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]].  Blaine sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] to allow the United States to construct [[Panama Canal|a canal through Panama]] without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British involvement in the strategically located [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].<ref>David Healy, ''James G.

This began to change in 1893. By the early 1880s, the United States had a small army stationed at scattered Western forts, and an old fashioned wooden navy. By 1890 the U.S. began investment in new naval technology including steam-powered battleships with powerful armaments and steel decking.\n\nIn 1893 the business community in [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] overthrew the Queen and sought annexation by President [[Benjamin Harrison|Harrison]], who forwarded the proposal to the Senate for approval. But the newly elected President [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]] withdrew the proposed annexation; Hawaii formed an independent [[Republic of Hawaii]]. Unexpectedly foreign-policy became a central concern of American politics.

He could have let the annexation of Hawaii move inexorably to its inevitable culmination.

The State Department had a cadre of diplomats who rotated around, but the most senior positions were political patronage appointments. The holders sometimes acquired a limited expertise, but the overall pool was shallow. At the level of presidential candidate and secretary of state, the entire half-century after 1850 showed minimal expertise or interest, with the exception of [[William Seward]] in the 1860s, and [[James G. Blaine]] in the 1880s. After 1900, experience deepened in the State Department, and at the very top level, Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Hoover and their secretaries of state comprised a remarkable group with deep knowledge of international affairs. American elections rarely featured serious discussion of foreign-policy, with a few exceptions such as 1910, 1916, 1920 and 1940.<ref>Thomas A.

The media relied primarily on a small number of foreign-policy experts based in New York City and Boston. Newspapers elsewhere copied their reports and editorials.

Conceptually, the media experts relied on American traditions \u2013 what would Washington or Jefferson or Lincoln have done in this crisis?-- And what impact it might have on current business conditions.

The U.S. increased pressure and was dissatisfied with Spanish responses.  When the American battleship the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} exploded for undetermined reasons in the harbor of [[Havana]], Cuba, on 15 February 1898, the issue became overwhelming and McKinley could not resist the demands for immediate action. Most Democrats and many Republicans demanded war to liberate Cuba. Almost simultaneously the two countries declared war. (Every other country was neutral.) The U.S. easily won the one-sided four-month-long [[Spanish\u2013American War]] from April through July. In the Treaty of Paris, the U.S. took over the last remnants of the Spanish Empire, notably [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Guam]].

The Army remained small but was reorganized in the [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] Administration along modern lines and no longer focused on scattered forts in the West. The [[Philippine\u2013American War]] was a short operation to suppress insurgents and ensure U.S. control of the islands; by 1907, however, interest in the Philippines as an entry to Asia faded in favor of the [[Panama Canal]], and American foreign policy centered on the Caribbean. The 1904 [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which proclaimed a right for the United States to intervene to stabilize weak states in the Americas, further weakened European influence in Latin America and further established U.S. regional hegemony.<ref>Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower'' (2008) chs. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910 ended a half century of peaceful borders and brought escalating tensions, as revolutionaries threatened American business interests and hundreds of thousands of refugees fled north. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] tried using military intervention to stabilize Mexico but that failed. After Mexico in 1917 rejected Germany's invitation in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] to join in war against the U.S., relations stabilized and there were no more interventions in Mexico. Military interventions did occur in other small countries like Nicaragua, but were ended by the [[Good Neighbor policy]] announced by President  [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1933, which allowed for American recognition of and friendship with dictatorships.<ref>Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower'' (2008) chs. 10\u201312</ref>\n\n==World War I and the Interwar years: 1913\u20131933==\n{{Main|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1913\u20131933}}\n\n===Wilson and World War I: 1913\u20131921===\n\n====From neutrality to war to end all wars: 1914\u20131917====\nAmerican foreign policy was largely determined by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who had shown little interest in foreign affairs before entering the White House in 1913. His chief advisor was \"Colonel\" Edward House, who was sent on many top-level missions. The United States [[Banana Wars|intervened militarily]] in many [[Latin American]] nations to protect U.S. interests, particularly the commercial interests of the American business community. President Wilson landed U.S. troops in Mexico in 1914, in [[Haiti]] in 1915, in the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1916, in Mexico a second time in 1916, and in Mexico several additional times before Wilson left office, in Cuba in 1917, and in [[Panama]] in 1918. Also, for most of the Wilson administration, the U.S. military occupied Nicaragua, installed a Nicaraguan president that the U.S. preferred, and ensured that the country signed treaties favorable to the U.S.<ref>[[James W. Loewen]], \"[[Lies My Teacher Told Me]]\" (New York: The New Press, 2018), p. 16</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of war in 1914, the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace. It insisted on its neutral rights, which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side. With the British blockade, there were almost no sales or loans to Germany, only to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. The widely publicized atrocities in Germany shocked American public opinion. Neutrality was supported by Irish-Americans, who hated Britain, by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral, and by women and the churches. It was supported by the more educated upscale [[White Anglo Saxon Protestant|WASP]] element, led by Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson insisted on neutrality, denouncing both British and German violations, especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed. The German U-boat torpedoed the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915. It sank in 20 minutes, killing 128 American civilians and over 1,000 Britons. It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats. American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerald A Combs|title=The History of American Foreign Policy: v.1: To 1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWRsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT325|year=2015|pages=325\u2013|isbn=9781317456377}}</ref> Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its [[U-boats]], but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare. It also made overtures to Mexico, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border. The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin, but by the military commanders and the Kaiser. They realized it meant war with the United States, but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports, and strike a winning blow with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front, where Russia had surrendered. Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917, Wilson asked Congress and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917. He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war with the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars. During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty, but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918. After the failure of the German spring offensive, as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day, the Germans were in a hopeless position, and thus surrendered. Coupled with Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918, the U.S. now had the initiative on the military, diplomatic and public relations fronts. [[Wilsonianism]]\u2014Wilson's ideals\u2014had become the hope of the world, including the civilian population Germany itself.<ref>[[John Milton Cooper]], ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) chs. 17\u201319</ref>\n\n====Invading Russia====\n{{Main|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nThe U.S. military together with forces of its [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invaded]] [[Russia]] in 1918. Approximately 250,000 invading soldiers, including troops from Europe, the US and the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Russia to aid the [[White Army]] against the [[Red Army]] of the new [[Soviet]] government in the [[Russian civil war]]. The invaders launched the [[North Russia Campaign|North Russia invasion]] from [[Arkhangelsk]] and the [[Allied Intervention in Siberia|Siberia invasion]] from [[Vladivostok]].  The invading forces included 13,000 U.S. troops whose mission after the end of World War I included the toppling of the new Soviet government and the restoration of the previous [[Tsarist regime]]. U.S. and other Western forces were unsuccessful in this aim and withdrew by 1920 but the Japanese military continued to occupy parts of [[Siberia]] until 1922 and the northern half of [[Sakhalin]] until 1925.<ref>Beyer, Rick, \"The Greatest Stories Never Told\" 2003: A&E Television Networks / The History Channel, pp. 152\u2013153, {{ISBN|0060014016}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Robert Maddox summarised, \"The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war, thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m23RrMeLt4C&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=robert+maddox,+russian+civil+war&source=bl&ots=e1ATvSmiWs&sig=_vHLd93fucLyfk0lnpIVkcbOCdc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3o__987PXAhXLMSYKHXneA90Q6AEIXDAO#v=onepage&q=robert%20maddox%2C%20russian%20civil%20war&f=false James W.

He was forced to accept British, French and Italian demands for financial revenge: Germany would be made to pay reparations that amounted to the total cost of the war for the Allies and admit guilt in humiliating fashion. It was a humiliating punishment for Germany which subsequent commentators thought was too harsh and unfair. Wilson succeeded in obtaining his main goal, a [[League of Nations]] that would hopefully resolve all future conflicts before they caused another major war.<ref>Manfred F. Boemeke et al, eds. ''The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment after Seventy-Five Years'' (1998)</ref> Wilson, however, refused to consult with [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]], who took control of Congress after the 1918 elections and which demanded revisions protecting the right of Congress to declare war. Wilson refused to compromise with the majority party in Congress, or even bring any leading Republican to the peace conference. His personal enemy, Henry Cabot Lodge, now control the Senate.  Lodge did support the league of Nations,  but wanted provisions that would insist that only Congress could declare war on behalf of the United States.  Wilson was largely successful in designing the new League of Nations, declaring it would be:\n:a great charter for a new order of affairs.  There is ground here for deep satisfaction, universal reassurance, and confident hope.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Milton Cooper|title=Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/breakingheartofw00coop|url-access=registration|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/breakingheartofw00coop/page/110 110]|isbn=9780521807869}}</ref>\nThe League did go into operation, but the United States never joined. With a two-thirds vote needed, the Senate did not ratify either the original Treaty or its Republican version. Washington made separate peace treaties with the different European nations. Nevertheless, Wilson's idealism and call for self-determination of all nations had an effect on nationalism across the globe, while at home his idealistic vision, called \"Wilsonianism\" of spreading democracy and peace under American auspices had a profound influence on much of American foreign policy ever since.<ref>Erez Manela, ''The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism'' (2007)</ref>\n\n==== Debate on Wilson's role====\nPerhaps the harshest attack on Wilson's diplomacy comes from Stanford historian [[Thomas A. Bailey]] in two books that remain heavily cited by scholars, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace'' (1944) and ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945), Bailey:\n:contended that Wilson's wartime isolationism, as well as his peace proposals at war's end, were seriously flawed. Highlighting the fact that American delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposed League of Nations, Bailey concluded that the president and his diplomatic staff essentially sold out, compromising important American ideals to secure mere fragments of Wilson's progressive vision. Hence, while Bailey primarily targeted President Wilson in these critiques, others, including House, did not emerge unscathed.<ref>Scot D. Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House: The Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\" '' Reviews in American History'' 45#4 (2017) pp 623\u201324.</ref>\n\nScot Bruce argues that:\n:More recently, prominent historians such as Thomas J. Knock, [[Arthur Walworth]], and [[John Milton Cooper]], among others, shied away from condemning Wilson and his peacemakers for extensive diplomatic failures in Paris. Instead, they framed Wilsonian progressivism, articulated through the League of Nations, as a comparatively enlightened framework tragically undermined by British and French machinations at the peace conference.&nbsp;... Historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], continued this analytical trend in her prize-winning book, ''Paris, 1919: Six Months That Changed the World'' (2001), which characterized Wilson as the frustrated idealist, unable to secure his progressive vision due to opposition from old-guard imperialists in his midst. While realists like Lloyd E. Ambrosius questioned the merits of defining Wilsonian progressivism too idealistically, the idea has persisted that well-intentioned U.S. delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson's proposals in Paris, and therefore compromised under pressure. Even the great Wilson scholar, [[Arthur S. Link]], subscribed to a version of this narrative.<ref>Bruce, \"Woodrow Wilson's House: The Hidden Hand of Wilsonian Progressivism\"  (2017) p. 624.</ref>\n\n===Interwar years, 1921\u20131933===\n{{See also|International relations (1919\u20131939)|Roaring Twenties}}\n\nIn the 1920s, American policy was an active involvement in international affairs, while ignoring the League of Nations, setting up numerous diplomatic ventures, and using the enormous financial power of the United States to dictate major diplomatic questions in Europe.  There  were large-scale humanitarian food aid missions during the war in Belgium, and after it in Germany and Russia, led by [[Herbert C. Hoover]].<ref>Guy Aiken, \u201cFeeding Germany: American Quakers in the Weimar Republic.\u201d Diplomatic History 43:4 (2019): 597-617.</ref>  There was also a major aid to Japan after the 1923 earthquake.<ref>J.

They operated large-scale  American intervention in issues of reparations and disarmament, with little contact with the League of Nations.  Historian Jerald Combs reports their administrations in no way returned to 19th-century isolationism.  The key Republican leaders:\n: including [[Elihu Root]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and Hoover himself, were Progressives who accepted much of Wilson's internationalism.... They did seek to use American political influence and economic power to goad European governments to moderate the Versailles peace terms, induce the Europeans to settle their quarrels peacefully, secure disarmament agreements, and strengthen the European capitalist economies to provide prosperity for them and their American trading partners.<ref>Jerald A.

It resulted in three major treaties: [[Four-Power Treaty]], [[Five-Power Treaty]] (the ''Washington Naval Treaty''), the [[Nine-Power Treaty]], and a number of smaller agreements. These treaties preserved peace during the 1920s but Were not renewed, as the world scene turned increasingly negative after 1930.<ref>Thomas H.

The [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in 1923 Caused an international crisis; Germany deliberately hyperinflated currency, making the occupation highly expensive for France.  The crisis was solved by a compromise brokered by the United States in the form of the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924.<ref>Patrick O.

Dawes]], set out a new financial scheme.  New York banks loaned Germany hundreds of millions of dollars that it used to pay reparations and rebuild its heavy industry. France, Britain and the other countries used the reparations in turn to repay wartime loans they received from the United States. By 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the [[Young Plan]] that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks ({{USD|26.3 billion}}) and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were [[Hoover Moratorium|suspended for a year]] and in 1932 during the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]] they were suspended indefinitely. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21 billion marks in reparations.

This was in line with both American neutrality policies, and with [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|a Europe-wide agreement to not sell arms for use in the Spanish war lest it escalate into a world war.]] Congress endorsed the embargo by a near-unanimous vote.  Only armaments were embargoed; American companies could sell oil and supplies to both sides.   Roosevelt quietly favored the left-wing Republican (or \"Loyalist\") government, but intense pressure by American Catholics forced him to maintain a policy of neutrality. The Catholics were outraged by the systematic torture, rape and execution of priests, bishops, and nuns by anarchist elements of the Loyalist coalition.  This successful pressure on Roosevelt was one of the handful of foreign policy successes notched by Catholic pressures on the White House in the 20th century.<ref>J.

All along the Spanish military forces supported the nationalists, and they steadily pushed the government forces back.

Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China.  Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through [[Lend-lease|Lend-Lease]], with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General John J. Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the \"[[Europe first]]\" strategy.  He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender.  Roosevelt often mentioned his role in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.<ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

The basic reason was that the Japanese plans were a  very closely held secret.   The attack fleet kept radio silence and was not spotted by anyone en route to Hawaii.  There were air patrols over Hawaii, but they were too few and too ineffective to scan a vast ocean.  Japan Navy spread false information\u2014using fake radio signals\u2014to indicate the main fleet was in Japanese waters, and suggested their main threat was north toward Russia.  The U.S. had [[Magic (cryptography)|MAGIC]], which successfully cracked the Japanese diplomatic code. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry and its diplomats were deliberately never told about the upcoming attack, so American intelligence was wasting its time trying to discover secrets through MAGIC  American intelligence expected attacks against British and Dutch possessions, and were looking for those clues.  At Pearl Harbor, they focused on predicting local sabotage. There was no overall American intelligence center\u2014the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was formed during this time. In 1941 no one coordinated the masses of information coming in from the Army, Navy, and State department, and from British and Dutch allies.  The system of notification was flawed, so the what the sender thought was an urgent message did not appear urgent to the recipient.  After the attack, congressional investigators identify and link together all sorts of small little signals pointing to an attack, while they discarded  signals pointing in other directions.  Even in hindsight  there was so much confusion, noise, and poor coordination  that Wohlstetter concludes no accurate predictions of the attack on Pearl Harbor was at all likely before December 7.<ref>Roberta Wohlstetter, ''Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision'' (1962).</ref><ref>Lt-Col Robert F. Piacine, \"Pearl Harbor: Failure of Intelligence?'

American policy substantially favored Britain and its allies, and the U.S. getting caught up in the war. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through [[Lend-lease|Lend-Lease]]. Industries greatly expanded to produce war materials. The United States officially entered World War II against Germany, Japan, and Italy in December 1941, following the Japanese surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. This time the U.S. was a full-fledged member of the [[Allies of World War II]], not just an \"associate\" as in the first war.  During the war, the U.S. conducted military operations on both the Atlantic and Pacific fronts. After the war and devastation of its European and Asian rivals, the United States found itself in a uniquely powerful position due to the lack of damage to its domestic industries.\n\n===Postwar peace===\n{{Further|Foreign policy of the Harry S. Truman administration#Postwar international order}}\n[[File:United Nations Building 3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Picture of UN building in New York|The major long-term goal of Roosevelt's foreign policy during the war was creating a [[United Nations]] to resolve all world problems]]\n\nAfter 1945, the [[isolationist]] pattern characterizing the inter-war period had ended for good.  It was Franklin Roosevelt policy to establish a new international organization that would be much more effective than the old League of Nations, and avoid its flaws.  He successfully sponsored the formation of the United Nations.\n\nThe United States was a major force in establishing the [[United Nations]] in 1945, hosting a meeting of fifty nations in San Francisco. Avoiding the rancorous debates of 1919, where there was no veto, the US and the Soviet Union, as well as Britain, France and China, became permanent members of the [[Security Council]] with veto power. The idea of the U.N. was to promote world peace through consensus among nations, with boycotts, sanctions and even military power exercised by the Security Council. It depended on member governments for funds and had difficulty funding its budget.  In 2009, its $5 billion budget was funded using a complex formula based on [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]; the U.S. contributed 20% in 2009. However, the United Nations' vision of peace soon became jeopardized as the international structure was rebalanced with the development and testing of nuclear weapons by major powers.\n\n==Cold War: 1947\u20131991==\n{{Main|Cold War}}\n[[File:Cold War Map 1980.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Map of [[Cold War]] alliances in 1980, with [[NATO]] and other U.S. allies in blue, the [[Warsaw Pact]] and allies of the [[Soviet Union]] in red or pink, [[China]] and its allies in yellow, and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned nations]] in light blue]]\n\n===Truman and Eisenhower===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of the Harry S. Truman administration|Foreign policy of the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration}}\n\nFrom the late 1940s until 1991, world affairs were dominated by the [[Cold War]], in which the U.S. and its allies faced the Soviet Union and its allies. There was no large-scale fighting but instead numerous regional wars as well as the  ever-present threat of a catastrophic nuclear war.<ref>Ralph B. Levering, ''The cold war, 1945\u20131987'' (1988) [https://archive.org/details/coldwar1945198700leve online free]</ref><ref>Martin McCauley, ''Russia, America, and the Cold War, 1949\u20131991'' (1998), A British perspective; [https://archive.org/details/russiaamericacol00mcca  online free]</ref>\n\nIn 1948 the United States enacted the [[Marshall Plan]], which supplied Western Europe\u2014including Germany\u2014with US$13 billion in reconstruction aid. Stalin vetoed any participation by East European nations.  A similar program was operated by the United States to restore the Japanese economy.  The U.S. actively sought allies, which it subsidized with military and economic \"foreign aid\", as well as diplomatic support. The main diplomatic initiative was the establishment of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949, committing the United States to nuclear defense of Western Europe, which engaged in a military buildup under NATO's supervision. The result was peace in Europe, coupled with the fear of Soviet invasion and a reliance on American protection.<ref>Mark J. Smith, ''NATO Enlargement During the Cold War: Strategy and System in the Western Alliance'' (2000).</ref>  In the 1950s, a number of other less successful regional alliances were developed by the United States,  such as the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO).  Economic and propaganda warfare against the communist world was part of the American toolbox.<ref>Shu Guang Zhang, ''Economic Cold War: America\u2019s Embargo Against China and the Sino-Soviet Alliance, 1949\u20131963'' (2002),</ref>  The United States operated a worldwide network of bases for its Army, Navy and Air Force, with large contingents stationed in Germany, Japan and South Korea.<ref>Kent E. Calder, ''Embattled garrisons: Comparative base politics and American globalism'' (2010).</ref>\n\nMost nations aligned with either the Western or Eastern camp, but after 1960 the Soviets broke with China as the Communist movement worldwide became divided. Some countries, such as India and Yugoslavia, tried to be neutral. Rejecting the [[rollback]] of Communism by force because it risked nuclear war, Washington developed a new strategy called [[containment]] to oppose the spread of [[communism]]. The containment policy was developed by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] in 1947. Kennan characterized the [[Soviet Union]] as an aggressive, anti-Western power that necessitated containment, a characterization which would shape US foreign policy for decades to come. The idea of containment was to match Soviet aggression with force wherever it occurred while not using [[nuclear weapons]]. The policy of containment created a bipolar, zero-sum world where the ideological conflicts between the Soviet Union and the United States dominated geopolitics. Due to the antagonism on both sides and each countries' search for security, a tense worldwide contest developed between the two states as the two nations' governments vied for global supremacy militarily, culturally, and influentially.\n\nThe Cold War was characterized by a lack of global wars but a persistence of regional [[proxy war]]s, often fought between client states and proxies of the United States and Soviet Union. The [[Covert United States foreign regime change actions|US also intervened]] in the affairs of other countries through a number of secret operations.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Containment policy seeking to stop Soviet expansion, involved the United States and its allies in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), a stalemate. Even longer and more disastrous was the  [[Vietnam War]] (1963\u201375).  Under Jimmy Carter, the U.S. and its Arab allies Succeeded in creating a Vietnamese -like disaster for the Soviet Union by supporting anti-Soviet [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|Mujahideen]] forces in [[Afghanistan]] (''[[Operation Cyclone]]'').<ref>Mark Galeotti, ''Afghanistan: The Soviet Union's Last War'' (2001).</ref>\n\n===Kennedy-Johnson 1961-1969===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of the John F.

The Cuban Missile crisis brought the world close to the brink of [[World War III]] but luckily cooler heads prevailed.]]\n\nThe Cold War reached its most dangerous point during the Kennedy administration in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, and lasted for thirteen days. It was the moment when the Cold War was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations. Kennedy decided not to invade or bomb Cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island. The crisis ended in a compromise, with the Soviets removing their missiles publicly, and the United States secretly removing its nuclear missiles in Turkey.  In Moscow, Communist leaders removed [[Nikita Khrushchev]] because of his reckless behavior.<ref>Don Munton and David A. Welch, ''The Cuban Missile Crisis: A Concise History'' (2006)</ref>\n\nVietnam and the Cold War are the two major issues that faced the Kennedy presidency. Historians disagree. However, there is general scholarly agreement that his presidency was successful on a number of lesser issues. Thomas Paterson finds that the Kennedy administration helped quiet the crisis over Laos;  was suitably cautious about the Congo; liberalized trade; took the lead in humanitarianism especially with the Peace Corps; helped solve a nasty dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands; achieve the Limited Test Man Treaty; created a new Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; defended Berlin; and strengthened European defenses. His willingness to negotiate with Khrushchev smoothed the Berlin crisis, and Kennedy's personal diplomacy earned him the respect of Third World leaders.<ref>Thomas G. Patterson, ed., ''Kennedy's Quest for Victory: American Foreign Policy 1961-1963'' (1989) p 19.</ref>\n\nOn the two major issues, no consensus has been reached. Michael L. Krenn argues in 2017:\n:Fifty-some years after his assassination, John F. Kennedy remains an enigma. Was he the brash and impulsive president who brought the world to the brink of World War III with the Cuban Missile Crisis? Or was he the brave challenger of the American military-industrial complex who would have prevented the Vietnam War? Various studies portray him as a Cold War liberal, or a liberal Cold Warrior, or come up with pithy phrases to summarize the man and his foreign policy.<ref>Michael L. Krenn, \"Kennedy, Johnson, and the Nonaligned World,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (2017) 47#1 p 219.</ref>\n\nThe [[Containment]] policy meant fighting communist expansion where ever it occurred, and the Communists aimed where the American allies were weakest. When he became president in November 1963, Lyndon Johnson's primary commitment was to his domestic policy, so he tried to minimize public awareness and congressional oversight of the operations in the war.<ref>Gary Donaldson, ''America at war since 1945'' (1996) p. 96</ref> Most of his advisers were pessimistic about the long term possibilities, and Johnson feared that if Congress took control, it would demand \"Why Not Victory\", as [[Barry Goldwater]] put it, rather than containment.<ref>Niels Bjerre-Poulsen, ''Right face: organizing the American conservative movement 1945\u201365'' (2002) p. 267</ref>  American  Boots on the ground in Vietnam skyrocketed  from 16,000 soldiers in 1963 to over 500,000 in 1968, plus many others in support roles outside Vietnam. Johnson refused to allow the trained men of the Army reserves or the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to serve in Vietnam, because that would involve Congressional oversight. Instead he relied increasingly on the draft, which became increasingly unpopular.  With college deferments from the draft widely available, out of the 2.5 million Americans who served in Vietnam (out of 27 million Americans eligible to serve in the military) 80% came from poor and working-class backgrounds.<ref>{{cite book|author=John E.

South Vietnam had a large Well-equipped army, but it left nearly all the fighting to the Americans. In February 1968 the Viet Cong launched an all-out attack on South Vietnamese forces across the country in the [[Tet Offensive]]. The ARVN (South Vietnam's army) successfully fought off the attacks and reduced the [[Viet Cong]] to a state of ineffectiveness;  thereafter, it was the army of North Vietnam that was the main opponent.<ref>Mark W. Woodruff, ''Unheralded Victory: The Defeat of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army, 1961\u20131973'' (2006) p. 56</ref>  However the Tet Offensive proved a public relations disaster for Johnson, as the public increasingly realized the United States was deeply involved in a war that few people understood.  [[File:My Lai massacre.jpg|thumb|right|Civilians shot by American soldiers in the [[:My Lai massacre]].]]\nStarting in 1964, [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|the antiwar movement began.]]  Some opposed the war on moral grounds, rooting for the peasant Vietnamese against the modernizing capitalistic Americans.

Moscow and Beijing went along, and accepted Nixon's terms of pulling their support away from Vietnam. This allowed Nixon to turn that war over to the government of South Vietnam, withdrawing all American and Allied troops, while continuing a bombing threat.

He insisted that the President make [[Paul Warnke]] Director of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], over strong opposition by Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]].  The firecest debates came over continuing d\u00e9tente policies with Moscow.

The transition to the new professional all-professional force was finalized, and the draft forgotten. A dramatic expansion of salary bases and benefits for both enlisted and officers made career service much more attractive. Under the aggressive leadership of Defense Secretary [[Caspar Weinberger]], the development of the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]] bomber was reinstated, and there was funding for a new [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] bomber, as well as [[cruise missiles]], the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]], and a 600 ship Navy. The new weaponry was designed with Soviet targets in mind.  In terms of real dollars after taxation, defense spending jump 34 percent between 1981 in 1985.

During the 1990s, the United States mostly scaled back its foreign policy budget as well as its cold war defense budget which amounted to 6.5% of GDP while focusing on domestic economic prosperity under President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], who succeeded in achieving a budget surplus for 1999 and 2000. The United States also served as a peacekeeper in the warring ethnic disputes in the former [[Yugoslavia]] by cooperating as a [[UN peacekeeping|U.N. peacekeeper]].\n\n===Global war on terrorism===\nA decade of economic prosperity ended with the September 11, 2001 attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City. The surprise attack by terrorists belonging to a militant [[Al-Qaeda]] organization prompted a national mourning and paradigm shift in U.S. foreign policy. The focus on domestic prosperity during the 1990s gave way to a trend of [[unilateralism|unilateral action]] under President [[George W. Bush]] to combat what was seen to be the growing trend of fundamentalist [[terrorism]] in the Middle East. The United States declared a ''[[War on Terrorism]]''. This policy dominated U.S. foreign policy over the last decade as the nation embarked on two military campaigns in the Middle East, in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Although both campaigns attracted international support, particularly the fighting in Afghanistan, the scale and duration of the war has lessened the motivation of American allies. Furthermore, when no [[weapons of mass destruction|WMDs]] were found after a military conquest of Iraq, there was worldwide skepticism that the war had been fought to prevent terrorism, and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] has had serious negative public relations consequences for the image of the United States. The \"[[Bush Doctrine]]\" shifted diplomatic and security policy toward maximizing the spread of liberal political institutions and democratic values. The policy has been called \"democratic realism,\" \"national security liberalism,\" \"democratic globalism,\" or \"messianic universalism.\" The policy helped inspire democratic upheavals in the Middle East.<ref>Jonathan Monten, \"The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.s.

Jefferson called for an empire of liberty, with the United States showing the way to Republicanism. Efforts to seize or Purchase colonies in  Latin America were rejected in the 1850s. In 1898\u20131900 there was a fierce debate by [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]]  Who formed a special-purpose lobby the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]] to fight against taking control of the Philippines after Spain left the scene.<ref>Fred H. Harrington, \"The Anti-Imperialist Movement in the United States, 1898\u20131900,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review,'' 22#2 (1935), pp.&nbsp;211\u2013230. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1898467 in JSTOR]</ref> The chief proponents of going to war in response to the cruelty of the Spanish Empire \u2013 most notably William Jennings Bryan \u2013 insisted the United States should not follow in the same footsteps. The opponents of declaring war, led by President McKinley, decided that America had responsibilities and insisted on taking the Philippines. Congress made the decision not to take ownership of Cuba. Any excitement about becoming an imperial power was short-lived, however, and by 1905 expansionary interests under Theodore Roosevelt turned away from  Asia and began focusing on the Panama Canal. The Democrats decided by 1934 to make the Philippines independent, which was done in 1946. Hawaii became integrated into the United States, and no one could decide \u2013 to this day \u2013 on the long-term status of Puerto Rico.<ref>Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) pp 264, 287, 306.</ref>\n\nHowever, during the Cold War, and especially after 9/11, critics have charged that the United States has become a worldwide empire  on its own. In 1945 the United States was planning to withdraw all its forces from Europe as soon as possible, but the Soviet actions in Poland and Czechoslovakia And especially in Greece forced a rethinking. Heavily influenced by [[George Kennan]], Washington policymakers decided that the Soviet Union was an expansionary dictatorship  that threatened American interests. Moscow's weakness was that it had to keep expanding to survive, and that by containing or stopping its growth stability could be achieved in Europe. The result was the Truman Doctrine (1947) regarding Greece and Turkey. A second equally important consideration was the need to restore the world economy, which required rebuilding and reorganizing Europe for growth. This issue, more than the Soviet threat, was the main impetus behind the Marshall Plan of 1948. A third factor was the realization, especially by Britain and the three Benelux nations, that American military involvement was needed. Historians have commented on the importance of \"the eagerness with which America's friendship with sought and its leadership welcomed.&nbsp;... In Western Europe, America built an empire 'by invitation'-\u2013 in the striking phrase coined by [[Geir Lundestad]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=John Darwin|title=After Tamerlane: The Rise and Fall of Global Empires, 1400\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z12AiODd8kC&pg=PA470|year=2010|page=470|isbn=9781596917606}}</ref><ref>\"If this American expansion created what we could call an American empire, this was to a large extent an empire by invitation.\" Geir Lundestad, \"Empire by Invitation?

Hopkins, ''American Empire: a Global History'' (2019).</ref>  He argues that by the 21st century traditional economic imperialism was no longer in play, noting that the oil companies  opposed the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Instead, anxieties about The negative impact of globalization on rural and rust-belt America were at work says Hopkins:\n:These anxieties prepared the way for a conservative revival based on family, faith and flag that enabled the neo-conservatives to transform conservative patriotism into assertive nationalism after 9/11. In the short term, the invasion of Iraq was a manifestation of national unity. Placed in a longer perspective, it reveals a growing divergence between new globalised interests, which rely on cross-border negotiation, and insular nationalist interests, which seek to rebuild fortress America.<ref>Anthony G. Hopkins,  \"[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03086530601143412 Capitalism, nationalism and the new American empire].\" ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 35.1 (2007): 95-117, quoting page 95.</ref>\n\nIn 2001\u20132010 numerous scholars debated the \"America as Empire\" issue.<ref>A. G. Hopkins \"Comparing British and American empires\" ''Journal of Global History'' (2007) 2#3 pp. 395-404.</ref>  Conservative Harvard professor [[Niall Ferguson]] concludes that Worldwide military and economic power have combined to make the U.S. the most powerful empire in history. It is a good idea he thinks, because like the successful British Empire in the 19th century it works to globalize free markets, enhanced the rule of law and promote representative government. He fears, however,  that Americans lack the long-term commitment in  manpower and money to keep the Empire operating.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire'' (2004), [https://www.amazon.com/Colossus-Rise-Fall-American-Empire/dp/0143034790 excerpt]</ref>\n\nMany \u2013 perhaps most \u2013 scholars have decided that that the United States lacks the key essentials of an empire. For example, while there are American military bases all over, the American soldiers do not rule over the local people, and the United States government does not send out governors or permanent settlers like all the historic empires did.<ref>Nugent, ''Habits of Empire'' p 287.</ref>  Harvard historian [[Charles S. Maier]] has examined the America-as-Empire issue at length.  He says the traditional understanding of the word \"empire\" does not apply because the United States does not exert formal control over other nations nor engage in systematic conquest. The best term is that the United States is a \"hegemon.\" Its enormous influence through high technology, economic power, and impact on popular culture gives it an international outreach that stands in sharp contrast to the inward direction of historic empires.<ref>Charles S. Maier, ''Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors'' (2006).</ref><ref>Grace Vuoto, \"The Anglo-American Global Imperial Legacy: Is There a Better Way?\" ''Canadian Journal of History,'' (2007) 42#2, 259-70.</ref>\n\nWorld historian [[Anthony Pagden]] asks is the United States really an empire? \n:I think if we look at the history of the European empires, the answer must be no. It is often assumed that because America possesses the military capability to become an empire, any overseas interest it does have must necessarily be imperial.&nbsp;... In a number of crucial respects, the United States is, indeed, very un-imperial.&nbsp;... America bears not the slightest resemblance to ancient Rome. Unlike all previous European empires, it has no significant overseas settler populations in any of its formal dependencies and no obvious desire to acquire any.&nbsp;... It exercises no direct rule anywhere outside these areas, and it has always attempted to extricate itself as swiftly as possible from anything that looks as if it were about to develop into even in direct rule.<ref>Anthony Pagden, \"Imperialism, liberalism & the quest for perpetual peace, ''Daedalus'' 134.2 (2005): 46-57, quoting pp 52-53.

However a diplomat needed a wife\u2014As senior officials gauge the competence of a budding diplomat in terms of his wife's 'Commanding Beauty' and 'Gentle Charm'. It was essential for her to project the proper image of American society by maintaining a proper upper-class household full of servants, entertaining guests and dignitaries, and even taking part in informal information intelligence gathering.<ref>Molly M. Wood, \"'Commanding Beauty' and 'Gentle Charm': American Women and Gender in the Early Twentieth-Century Foreign Service.\" Diplomatic History 31.3 (2007): 505\u2013530.</ref>  The wife had to relate well to the high society lifestyle of European diplomacy. Family money helped a great deal, given the modest pay scales of the American diplomatic service, and the limited entertainment budgets. Extremely rich diplomats had an advantage, such as [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, 1938\u201340.  His numerous children were considered suitable spouses for  British aristocrats.  In 1944, his daughter [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]] married [[William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington|Billy Cavendish]], the Marquess of Hartington and elder son of the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], the head of one of England's most aristocratic families.\n\n[[Frances E. Willis]] (1899\u20131983) was a famous pioneer. She joined the foreign service after earning a PhD in political science from Stanford. She was the third woman in the foreign service, and practically all her postings were \"firsts\"\u2014the first woman ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]'', the first woman appointed deputy chief of mission, the first female Foreign Service officer (FSO) appointed ambassador, the first woman to serve as ambassador to three posts, the first woman appointed Career Minister in 1955 and the first woman appointed Career Ambassador in 1962. She was posted to Chile, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Britain, and Finland as well as the State Department. In 1953, she became the first woman American ambassador (to Switzerland) and later served as ambassasor to Norway and Ceylon. Her biographer credits her competence, Language skills, research abilities, hard work, and self-confidence, as well as mentoring from the undersecretary of state, Joseph Grew, and Ambassador Hugh Gibson.<ref>Philip Nash, \"'A Woman's Touch in Foreign Affairs'? The Career of Ambassador Frances E. Willis\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' (2002) 13#2 pp 1\u201319.</ref>\n\nSince the late 20th century, high-profile ambassadorships typically are selected by the White House and go to prominent political or financial supporters of the president. These amateurs are mostly sent to Western Europe or nations with strong economic ties to the U.S. Professional career ambassadors move up through the State Department hierarchy and typically are posted to smaller countries and those with lower trade with the United States. The vast majority of semiprofessional diplomats were appointed to the most powerful countries.<ref>Costel Calin,  and Kathy R. Fitzpatrick, \"Diplomatic Amateurs or Qualified Professionals? Profiling the American Ambassador,\" ''White House Studies'' (2013) 13#4 pp 387\u2013402.</ref>  The pattern varies according to presidential style.  For example, under President [[George W. Bush]] (2001\u20132009) the foreign service and the U.S. Agency for International Development were underfunded and often used for political rather than diplomatic reasons.<ref>J.

{"title_page": "Frans Hals catalogue raisonn\u00e9, 1989", "text_new": "The following is the list of 145 paintings indexed as autograph by [[Frans Hals]], written by the art historian and Hals specialist [[Claus Grimm]] in 1989. The list is by catalogue number and is more or less in order of creation, starting from around 1610 when Hals began painting on his own. Most of these works are still considered autograph, though one has since been reattributed to [[Judith Leyster]]. In addition to this list, Grimm added comments and additional entries to [[Seymour Slive]]'s lists of lost and doubtful paintings. He also rejected several Slive attributions, making his list is considerably shorter.

The list is by catalog number and more or less in order of creation, starting from around 1610 when Frans Hals began painting on his own. Most of these are still considered autograph, though since this work began, one has been reattributed to [[Judith Leyster]]. In addition to this list, Grimm added comments and additional entries to [[Seymour Slive]]'s lists of lost and doubtful paintings.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations.

He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

The leading body of the CWI is the World Congress, which elected an International Executive Committee (IEC) to govern between congresses. The IEC then appointed an International Secretariat (IS) which is responsible for the day-to-day work of the International. The majority of the IS founded a faction called  \u201cIn Defence of a Working Class and Trotskyist CWI\u201d (IDWCTCWI) in November 2018 at an IEC meeting, in opposition to the rest of the IEC. This faction held criticisms of a number of national sections of the CWI. The majority of the IEC disagreed with the faction's criticisms, and took issue with the methods used by faction members to conduct the debate, which included talk of expelling one of the sections the faction was criticising.\n\nThe majority of the [[Revolutionary Left (Spain)|Spanish]], [[Revolutionary Socialism (Venezuela)|Venezuelan]], Mexican, and [[Revolutionary Socialism (Portugal)|Portuguese sections]], the first three of which had joined the CWI in 2017 after leaving the International Marxist Tendency, initially supported the IS faction but in April 2019 split with them and then left the CWI altogether to form their own international tendency, [[International Revolutionary Left]]. <ref>https://izquierdarevolucionaria.net/index.php/english/11671-founding-congress-of-the-international-revolutionary-left</ref> In Spain, a minority which supported the CWI Majority reconstituted themselves as ''[[Revolutionary Socialism (Spain)|Socialismo Revolucionario]]'', which has been the CWI's section in Spain prior to its 2017 merger with ''Izquierda Revolucionaria''.

The faction attracted support from an overall minority of the CWI's national sections. Most of the IEC, and most of the CWI's national sections, stood in opposition to the faction. But both the Faction, and its opponents claimed a majority of the individual members.\n\nThe IEC outlined a process of discussion and debate to avoid a split, leading to a World Congress in January 2020, the highest decision-making body of the CWI. The Taaffe-led IS faction initially agreed, then withdrew their participation from the committee charged with organizing the debate, and declared they would not participate in the IEC or the World Congress. A Special Conference of the Socialist Party of England and Wales voted by a margin of 173 - 35 to support the Faction and sponsor the International Faction conference. This conference was held in July 2019, open only to CWI members who supported the faction, and asserted that they had 'dissolved and refounded' the CWI.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialistalternative.org/2019/07/26/bureaucratic-coup-will-not-stop-cwi-majority-from-building-a-strong-revolutionary-socialist-international/|title=Bureaucratic Coup Will Not Stop CWI Majority from Building a Strong Revolutionary Socialist International! {{!}} Socialist Alternative|last=Koritz|first=Joshua|access-date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistworld.net/index.php/international/europe/britain/10255-britain-socialist-party-conference-overwhelmingly-supports-refounding-cwi|title=Britain: Socialist Party conference overwhelmingly supports refounding CWI|last=Sell|first=Hannah|website=socialistworld.net|access-date=5 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190802215833/http://www.socialistworld.net/index.php/international/europe/britain/10255-britain-socialist-party-conference-overwhelmingly-supports-refounding-cwi|archive-date=2 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1262/taaffe-expels-his-majority/|title=Taaffe expels his majority \u2013 Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=5 August 2019}}</ref> The majority of the CWI continued operating and held an IEC meeting in August 2019, and declared they will \"provisionally organize the renewed international organization with the name \u201cCWI \u2013 Majority\u201d.\"<ref name=\"declaration\"/>. \n\nIn September 2019, a minority faction of the [[South Africa]]n section, the [[Workers and Socialist Party]] (WASP), left the CWI and formed the Marxist Workers Party in support of the Refounded CWI.<ref name=mwp>http://marxistworkersparty.org.za/?p=613</ref> The remainder of the WASP declared itself for the CWI Majority.<ref name=southaf>https://workerssocialistparty.co.za/the-workers-and-socialist-party-remains-a-force-for-working-class-unity/</ref> The same month, a majority of the [[Socialist Alternative (Germany)|German section]] voted by a 2 to 1 margin to support the CWI Majority.

parties.\n\nThe group was formerly known as the [[Committee for a Workers' International]]. As a result of a split in August 2019, in which a faction declared themselves the \"refounded CWI\", the remaining sections, after initially calling themselves the CWI Majority, renamed themselves International Socialist Alternative at their World Congress in February 2020.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Committee for a Workers' International}}\nA dispute broke out in the CWI in 2018 concerning what the CWI leadership described as a watering down\nof the Socialist Programme of its Irish section and the tendency of its leaders to see \"all struggles through the prism of the women\u2019s movement, rather than seeing how it interconnects with other struggles\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/socialist-party-documents-illustrate-criticism-from-international-comrades-1.3815624|title=Socialist Party documents illustrate criticism from international comrades|last=Editor|first=Fiach Kelly Deputy Political|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>. The Irish Section at the time had 3 TDs, although they lost one of them in the January 2020 election, and another left the Party during the course of the dispute<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/paul-murphy-leaves-socialist-party-to-launch-new-group-1.4031488|title=Paul Murphy leaves Socialist Party to launch new group|last=McGee|first=Harry|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>.\nIn 2019, the CWI split four ways. The leading body of the CWI is the World Congress, which elected an International Executive Committee (IEC) to govern between congresses. The IEC then appointed an International Secretariat (IS) which is responsible for the day-to-day work of the International. The majority of the IS founded a faction called  \u201cIn Defence of a Working Class and Trotskyist CWI\u201d (IDWCTCWI) in November 2018 at an IEC meeting, in opposition to the rest of the IEC. This faction held criticisms of a number of national sections of the CWI. The majority of the IEC disagreed with the faction's criticisms, and took issue with the methods used by faction members to conduct the debate, which included talk of expelling one of the sections the faction was criticising.\n\nThe majority of the [[Revolutionary Left (Spain)|Spanish]], [[Revolutionary Socialism (Venezuela)|Venezuelan]], Mexican, and [[Revolutionary Socialism (Portugal)|Portuguese sections]], the first three of which had joined the CWI in 2017 after leaving the International Marxist Tendency, initially supported the IS faction but in April 2019 split with them and then left the CWI altogether to form their own international tendency, [[International Revolutionary Left]]. <ref>https://izquierdarevolucionaria.net/index.php/english/11671-founding-congress-of-the-international-revolutionary-left</ref> In Spain, a minority which supported the CWI Majority reconstituted themselves as ''[[Revolutionary Socialism (Spain)|Socialismo Revolucionario]]'', which has been the CWI's section in Spain prior to its 2017 merger with ''Izquierda Revolucionaria''.
