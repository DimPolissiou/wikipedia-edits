He collaborated with the likes of fellow pop stars [[Melanie C]], [[Eliza Doolittle (singer)|Eliza Doolittle]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Katy B]], [[Kimberley Walsh]] and [[Pixie Lott]], on \"Greatest Day\", a track originally performed by British band, [[Take That]]. The track was produced by [[Gary Barlow]] and recorded at [[Sarm Studios]] in London.

The single debuted at number 44 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming not only Maynard's first single to miss the top-ten, but also his first to miss the top-forty altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 - Official Charts Company|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> Within a month Conor released his third single called \"Royalty\". The single is extracted from his second upcoming album, which is predicted to be released at the beginning of 2016.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the single \"[[I'm Famous]]\" by Marcus Butler was released featuring Maynard. It peaked at number 85 on the UK Singles Chart top 100, failing to reach the top 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/48966/marcus-butler-ft-conor-maynard/|title=MARCUS BUTLER FT CONOR MAYNARD - full Official Chart History - Official Charts Company|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> The single spent only one week on the chart. Maynard was also featured alongside Butler in the music video for the same song.\n\nConor performed at the Hertfordshire Summer Ball on 13 May 2016, along with other acts such as Becky Hill.\n\nIn July 2016, due to the success of his covers on YouTube, Conor announced he would be releasing an album of covers with one original track. A few of the covers included \"Pillowtalk\", \"One Dance\", \"Hello\" and \"Stitches\". The original was called \"This Is My Version\" and was written about a relationship he had previously been in. The album, ''Covers'', was released on 5 August 2016.\n\nMaynard featured on a dance track called \"Dancing in the Headlights\" by [[DJ Antoine]]. Maynard also featured on a track called \"Catch Me Here\" by Drumsound and Bassline Smith which Conor had already written for 2 years. On 23 December 2016 he released the single \"Are You Sure?\" with [[Kris Kross Amsterdam]] featuring vocals from [[Ty Dolla Sign]].\n\nIn an interview on 8 January 2018 with [[Caspar Lee]], Maynard discussed the status of his new album. He revealed that following the success of his debut album, he entered into a relationship and found it difficult to effectively split his time which resulted in the disappointing charting of ''[[Talking About]]'' and ''Royalty''. Maynard subsequently began making the majority of his income via online stream such as [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] as opposed to album sales and live performances. He then admitted that he wants to release a new album of original music online but is currently unable to because he is under contractual talks with his label. He also stated that once the situation is fixed he will be able to release original content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14AtQGTNm6Q|title=Conor Maynard - ON FAME, LOGAN PAUL & HIS BROTHER'S SCANDAL (Honest Interview)|first=|last=Caspar|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Maynard was also featured alongside Butler in the music video for the same song.\n\nConor performed at the Hertfordshire Summer Ball on 13 May 2016, along with other acts such as Becky Hill.\n\nIn July 2016, due to the success of his covers on YouTube, Conor announced he would be releasing an album of covers with one original track. A few of the covers included \"Pillowtalk\", \"One Dance\", \"Hello\" and \"Stitches\". The original was called \"This Is My Version\" and was written about a relationship he had previously been in. The album, ''Covers'', was released on 5 August 2016.\n\nMaynard featured on a dance track called \"Dancing in the Headlights\" by [[DJ Antoine]]. Maynard also featured on a track called \"Catch Me Here\" by Drumsound and Bassline Smith which Conor had already written for 2 years. On 23 December 2016 he released the single \"Are You Sure?\" with [[Kris Kross Amsterdam]] featuring vocals from [[Ty Dolla Sign]].\n\nIn an interview on 8 January 2018 with [[Caspar Lee]], Maynard discussed the status of his new album. He revealed that following the success of his debut album, he entered into a relationship and found it difficult to effectively split his time which resulted in the disappointing charting of ''[[Talking About]]'' and ''Royalty''. Maynard subsequently began making the majority of his income via online stream such as [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] as opposed to album sales and live performances. He then admitted that he wants to release a new album of original music online but is currently unable to because he is under contractual talks with his label. He also stated that once the situation is fixed he will be able to release original content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14AtQGTNm6Q|title=Conor Maynard - ON FAME, LOGAN PAUL & HIS BROTHER'S SCANDAL (Honest Interview)|first=|last=Caspar|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
