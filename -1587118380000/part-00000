He sings like he has a point to prove throughout ''The Burning''. A telling sign of the frontman's burgeoning confidence comes on \"Elysium\" \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he's communing with lost souls on \"Lightning\" or offering a consolatory ear on closer \"Native Son\", he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nMetal Temple deemed the album a 9/10 saying \u201c''The Burning''\u201d is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. Hawkins and Leslie's dual guitar attack is on point, Dawson's drums precise and well deftly executed. Taylor's vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal.

The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and Harris's love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of \"Bible Black\" sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/british-lion-arrys-other-army-return-on-sizzling-form|title=British Lion: \u2018Arry\u2019s other army return on sizzling form|last=January 2020|first=Dom Lawson 17|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nCryptic Rock said British Lion are one of the more interesting and intriguing side projects in [[Hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] today.

After attending [[Williams College]] and then the [[Yale]] School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in 1932, and co-founded the [[Actors Studio]] in 1947. With [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]] and [[Cheryl Crawford]], his actors' studio introduced \"[[Method Acting]]\" under the direction of [[Lee Strasberg]].

During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar.\n\nHis films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\"<ref name=Stevens/> His first such \"issue\" film was ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), with [[Gregory Peck]], which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'', one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was [[Marlon Brando]]'s breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', which introduced [[James Dean]] to movie audiences.\n\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1952 at the time of the [[Hollywood blacklist]], which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues.

At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a \"deeper question: 'Why America?

''Elia Kazan: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi (2000) pp. vii\u2013xi</ref> Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group's most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by [[Clifford Odets]], ''Waiting for Lefty'', and his performance was called \"dynamic,\" leading some to describe him as the \"proletarian thunderbolt.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|23}}\n\nAmong the themes that would run through all of his work were \"personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice\", writes film critic William Baer.<ref name=Kazan1/> Other critics have likewise noted his \"strong commitment to the social and social psychological\u2014rather than the purely political\u2014implications of drama\".<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|33}}\n\nBy the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including [[Robert Ardrey]]'s well-known play ''[[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]]''. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by [[Thornton Wilder]], ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and [[Fredric March]]. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Kazan won the [[New York Drama Critics Award]] for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]], and then directed ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' by [[Tennessee Williams]], both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a \"prize that launched his career.\"<ref name=Lahr>Lahr, John.

Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: [[Harry Morgan]], [[John Garfield]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Will Geer]], [[Howard Da Silva]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Lee J.

In 1951, [[Lee Strasberg]] became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the \"[[Method acting|Method]]\" to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s teachings. The \"Method\" school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.\n\nAmong Strasberg's students were [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Mildred Dunnock]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Maureen Stapleton]], [[Eli Wallach]], and [[James Whitmore]]. \nKazan directed two of the Studio's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Karl Malden and [[Marlon Brando]], in the [[Tennessee Williams]] play ''A Streetcar Named Desire''.\n\n==Film career==\nThough at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'', where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, [[antisemitism]], for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1949 he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'', which dealt with issues of racism in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.\n\nIn 1947, he directed the courtroom drama ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang!]]'', and in 1950 he directed ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'', starring [[Richard Widmark]], in a thriller shot on the streets of [[New Orleans]]. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in \"energizing\" the action scenes.<ref name=Freer/> He won the [[Venice Film Festival]] International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that [[Zero Mostel]] also act in the film, despite Mostel being \"blacklisted\" as a result of [[HUAC]] testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:\n:Each director has a favorite in his cast, ... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel ... I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met ... I constantly sought his company ... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the \"industry's\" blacklist ... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|383}}\n\n[[File:Brando - Leigh - 1951.jpg|thumb|Brando and Vivien Leigh in a scene from ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1951)]]\nIn 1951, after introducing and directing [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Karl Malden]] in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', which won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12.\n\nDespite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, but he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:\n\n:On \"Streetcar\" we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.<ref name=Stevens/><ref name=Freer/>\n\nKazan's next film was ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his \"first real film\" because of those factors.<ref name=Freer/>\n\nIn 1954 he again used Brando as a star in ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.  As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for 12 [[Academy Awards]], and won 8, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], for Marlon Brando.\n\n''On the Waterfront'' was also the screen debut for [[Eva Marie Saint]], who won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:\n\n{{quote|text=I ended up crying. Crying and laughing ... I mean there was such an attraction there ... That smile of his ... He was very tender and funny ... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.<ref name=Schickel>Schickel, Richard. ''Elia Kazan: A Biography'', HarperCollins (2005).</ref>{{rp|295\u2013296}}}}\n\n''Life'' magazine described ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' as the \"most brutal movie of the year\" but with \"the year's tenderest love scenes,\" and stating that Saint was a \"new discovery\" in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in ''On the Waterfront'' that she \"starts her real trip to fame.\"<ref>''Life'' magazine, July 19, 1954 pp. 45\u201350</ref>\n\nThe film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer [[Leonard Bernstein]].\n\n[[File:James Dean in East of Eden trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|<center>James Dean in ''East of Eden''</center>]]\nAfter the success of ''On the Waterfront'' he went on to direct the screen adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel, ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' in 1955. As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, [[James Dean]]. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag.<ref name=Springer>Springer, Claudia. ''James Dean Transfigured: The Many Faces of Rebel Iconography'', Univ. of Texas Press (2007)</ref>{{rp|194}} The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), directed by Kazan's friend, [[Nicholas Ray]], and then ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'', (dir. George Stevens, 1956)\n\nAuthor Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he \"kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.\"<ref name=Rathgeb>Rathgeb, Douglas L. ''The Making of Rebel Without a Cause'', McFarland (2004) p. 20</ref> As a result, Kazan was forced to \"baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers,\" so he wouldn't run away during production. Co-star [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that \"his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears.\"\n\nDean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director [[Nicholas Ray]] to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in ''Rebel Without a Cause''. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. \"Dean himself did not seem to believe it,\" notes Rathgeb. \"He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.\"<ref name=Rathgeb/>\n\nThe film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with an effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was ''East of Eden''.\n\nIn 1961, he introduced [[Warren Beatty]] in his first screen appearance with a starring role in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'' (1961), with [[Natalie Wood]]; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author [[Peter Biskind]] points out that Kazan \"was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.\"<ref name=Biskind>Biskind, Peter. ''Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America'', Simon & Schuster (2010) pp. 24\u201333</ref> Biskind notes also that they \"were wildly dissimilar\u2014mentor vs. prot\u00e9g\u00e9, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.\"<ref name=Biskind/>  Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:\n\n:Warren\u2014it was obvious the first time I saw him\u2014wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|603}}\n\nBiskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: \"The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HUAC. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something\u2014why did you name all those names?'\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\nBeatty recalled the episode: \"In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.\" Biskind describes how \"Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.\"<ref name=Biskind/> Beatty, years later, during a [[Kennedy Center]] tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan \"had given him the most important break in his career.\"<ref name=Biskind/>{{rp|23}}\n\nBeatty's costar, [[Natalie Wood]], was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer [[Suzanne Finstad]] notes that a \"turning point\" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'': \"She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie.\"<ref name=Finstad>Finstad, Suzanne. ''Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood'', Three Rivers Press (2001)</ref>{{rp|107}} In 1961, after a \"series of bad films, her career was already in decline,\" notes Rathgeb.<ref name=Rathgeb/>{{rp|199}} Kazan writes that the \"sages\" of the film community declared her as \"washed up\" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n\n:When I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J., I said to myself. I liked [[Robert Wagner|Bob Wagner]], I still do.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|602}}\n\nKazan cast her as the female lead in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'', and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, \"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on ''Splendor.''\"<ref name=Finstad/>{{rp|259}} She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of \"Kazan's wizardry ...  produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.\"<ref name=Finstad/>{{rp|260}}\n\nActor [[Gary Lockwood]], who also acted in the film, felt that \"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.\" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). \"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,\" writes Kazan.<ref name=Finstad/>{{rp|263}} \"And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.\"\n\n===Screenwriters===\nKazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[William Inge]]; in film, he worked again with Willams (''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''Baby Doll''), Inge (''Splendor in the Grass''), [[Budd Schulberg]] (''On the Waterfront'' and ''A Face in the Crowd''), [[John Steinbeck]] (''Viva Zapata!''), and [[Harold Pinter]] (''The Last Tycoon''). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, \"he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, ''[[The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond]]'', was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/11/unproduced-tennessee-williams-screenplay-finally-reaching-screens.html \"Unproduced Tennessee Williams screenplay finally reaching movie theaters\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 25, 2009</ref>\n\nWilliams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of \"creative slumps\" by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, \"Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.\"<ref name=Lahr/>\n\nAmong Kazan's other films were ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), ''East of Eden'' (1955), ''Baby Doll'' (1956), ''Wild River'' (1960), and ''The Last Tycoon'' (1976).\n\n==Literary career==\n{{expand section|date=July 2013}}\nIn between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including ''[[America America]]'' and ''[[The Arrangement (novel)|The Arrangement]]'', both of which tell the story of Kazan's Greek immigrant ancestors. Both novels were later made into films.\n\n==Directing style==\n\n===Preference for unknown actors===\nKazan strove for \"cinematic realism,\" a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict \"social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure.<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/news/la-et-casting-directors-20110221,0,5907423.story \"Countdown to the Oscars: No Oscar love for casting directors\"] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2011</ref> As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as [[Lee Remick]], [[Jo Van Fleet]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[James Dean]], and [[Jack Palance]], their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer [[George Stevens, Jr.]] that he felt that \"big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits ... they're not pliable anymore.\" Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:<ref name=Stevens>Stevens, George Jr. ''Conversations with the Great Moviemakers of Hollywood's Golden Age'', Alfred A. Knopf (2006) pp. 389\u2013408</ref>\n\n:Now what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nKazan goes on to describe how he got to understand James Dean, as an example:\n\n:When I met him he said, \"I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike{{nbsp}}...\" It was his way of communicating with me, saying \"I hope you like me,{{nbsp}}...\" I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love ... I went to [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, \"Go ahead.\"<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n===Topics of personal and social realism===\nKazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:\n\n:I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With ''East of Eden'' ... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time ... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kazan-Face-still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andy Griffith]], in first film role, with [[Patricia Neal]], from ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957) {{pufc|Kazan-Face-still.jpg|date=June 10, 2014}}]] -->\nFilm historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on \"reality\", although his style was not defined as \"naturalistic.\" She adds: \"He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.\"<ref name=Rapf>Rapf, Joanna E. ''On the Waterfront'', Cambridge Univ. Press (2003)</ref>{{rp|33}} Kazan states that \"unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|33}}\n\nIn his later years he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a\n\"collective art,\" as he once believed:\n\n:To be successful it should express the vision, the conviction, and the insistent presence of one person.<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nFilm author [[Peter Biskind]] described Kazan's career as \"fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|22}} Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:\n\n:I don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal ... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|22}}\n\nNonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', written by screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]], which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> Another political film was ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957). His protagonist, played by [[Andy Griffith]] (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn \"of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation.\" Kazan states, \"Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.\"<ref>Keyishian, Harry. ''Screening Politics: The Politician in American Movies'', Rowman & Littlefield (2003) p. 62</ref>\n\n===Use of \"Method\" acting===\n\nAs a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of [[method acting|\"Method\" actors]], especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, \"I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance ''including'' so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends ... The director is a ''desperate beast!'' ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> Actor [[Robert De Niro]] called him a \"master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nKazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:\n\n:I don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me ... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience ... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors ... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nHe explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:\n\n:When I talk to the actors they begin to give me ideas, and I grab them because the ideas they give me turn them on. I want the breath of life from them rather than the mechanical fulfillment of the movement which I asked for ... I love actors. I used to be an actor for eight years, so I do appreciate their job.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nKazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes, and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in ''[[Baby Doll]]'', for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Carroll Baker]], he privately asked Wallach, \"Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?\" Wallach writes, \"I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'\" Kazan replies, \"Good idea, play it that way.\"<ref name=Wallach>Wallach, Eli. ''The Good, the Bad, and Me: In My Anecdotage'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2005) p. 172</ref> Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:\n\n:What is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act ... The scene on the swings (Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker) in ''Baby Doll'' is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.<ref>Young, Jeff. ''Kazan: The Master Director Discusses his films \u2013 Interviews with Elia Kazan'', Newmarket Press (1999) p. 224</ref>\n\n===Being an \"actor's director\"===\nJoanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director [[Nicholas Ray]] considered him \"the best actor's director the United States has ever produced.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|22}} Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that \"he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method ... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism.\"<ref name=Hirsch>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/17/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood17-2010feb17 \"Elia Kazan, an actor's director\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 17, 2010</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were [[Patricia Neal]], who co-starred with [[Andy Griffith]] in ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957): \"He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.\"<ref name=Hirsch/> [[Anthony Franciosa]], a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:\n\n:He would always say, 'Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.' You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side\u2014no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence ... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.<ref>Salvi, Delia. ''Friendly Enemies: Maximizing the Director-Actor Relationship'', Watson-Guptill (2002) pp. 239\u2013240</ref>\n\nHowever, in order to get quality acting from [[Andy Griffith]], in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls \"an astonishing movie debut,\"<ref name=Schickel/>{{rp|338}} Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: \"I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.\"<ref>Williamson, Jerry Wayne. ''Hillbillyland: What the Movies Did to the Mountains and What the Mountains Did to the Movies'', Univ. of North Carolina Press Books (1995) p. 168</ref>\n\nActress [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] calls Kazan her \"best friend,\" and notes that \"he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life.\"<ref name=Hirsch/> \"He would find out if your life was like the character,\" says [[Carroll Baker]], star of ''Baby Doll'', \"he was the best director with actors.\"<ref name=Hirsch/>\n\nKazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'' (1976). He remembers that [[Robert De Niro]], the star of the film, \"would do almost anything to succeed,\" and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro \"is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.\"<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|766}}\n\nThe powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits.  Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, \"Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.\"<ref name=Kazan1/>{{rp|210}} Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|766}} Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that \"for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of [[Vito Corleone]] in [[The Godfather Part II|''The Godfather, part II'']], ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest.\"<ref>Brenner, Marie. \"Tender is the Plight\", ''Texas Monthly'', January 1977.</ref>\n\n[[Marlon Brando]], in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:\n:I have worked with many movie directors\u2014some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for ... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me ... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation ... He gave his cast freedom and ... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect ... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg ... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.\n\n:He was an arch-manipulator of actors' feelings, and he was extraordinarily talented; perhaps we will never see his like again.<ref name=Brando>Brando, Marlon; Lindsey, Robert.

Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] members who he said had been Communists: [[Clifford Odets]], [[J. Edward Bromberg]], Lewis Leverett, [[Morris Carnovsky]], [[Phoebe Brand]], Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and [[Paula Strasberg|Paula Miller]], who later married [[Lee Strasberg]].

Kazan was already \"denied accolades\" from the [[American Film Institute]], and other film critics' associations. According to Mills, \"It's time for the Academy to recognize this genius,\" adding that \"We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.\"<ref name=Mills/> In response, former vice president of the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], Joseph McBride, claimed that an honorary award recognizes \"the totality of what he represents, and Kazan's career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people's careers.\"<ref>Weinraub, Bernard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/movies/a-mccarthy-era-memory-that-can-still-chill.html \"New York Times\"]</ref>\n\nIn later interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first \"family,\" and the \"best thing professionally\" that ever happened to him:\n\n:The Group Theatre said that we shouldn't be committed to any fixed political program set by other people outside the organization. I was behaving treacherously to the Group when I met downtown at CP [Communist Party] headquarters, to decide among the Communists what we should do in the Group, and then come back and present a united front, pretending we had not been in caucus ... \n:I was tried by the Party and that was one of the reasons I became so embittered later. The trial was on the issue of my refusal to follow instructions, that we should strike in the Group Theatre, and insist that the membership have control of its organization. I said it was an artistic organization, and I backed up Clurman and Strasberg who were not Communists ... The trial left an indelible impression on me ... Everybody else voted against me and they stigmatized me and condemned my acts and attitude. They were asking for confession and self-humbling. I went home that night and told my wife \"I am resigning.\" But for years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. I still believed in it. But not in the American Communists. I used to make a difference and think: \"These people here are damned fools but in Russia they have got the real thing,\" until I learned about the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]], and gave up on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].<ref>Ciment 1974:&nbsp;22</ref>\n\nMills notes that prior to becoming a \"friendly witness,\" Kazan discussed the issues with Miller:\n:To defend a secrecy I don't think right and to defend people who have already been named or soon would be by someone else ... I hate the Communists and have for many years, and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.<ref name=Mills/>\n\nMiller put his arm around Kazan and retorted, \"Don't worry about what I'll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.\"<ref name=Mills/>\n\nIn his memoirs, Kazan writes that his testimony meant that \"the big shot had become the outsider.\" He also notes that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, [[Tennessee Williams]], with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams \"the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.\"<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|495}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\n[[File:Elia Kazan NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Elia Kazan in 1967]]\nElia Kazan was married three times.<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/> His first wife was playwright [[Molly Kazan|Molly Day Thacher]]. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter [[Nicholas Kazan]]. His second marriage, to the actress [[Barbara Loden]], lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to [[Frances Kazan|Frances Rudge]] continued until his death, in 2003, aged 94.\n\nIn 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to Kazan's birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:\n\n{{quote|In my own view, the solution is to talk about human beings and not about abstracts, to reveal the culture and the social moment as it is reflected in the behavior and the lives of individual people. Not to be \"correct.\" To be total. So I do not believe in any ideology that does not permit\u2014no encourage\u2014the freedom of the individual.<ref name=Ciment1>Ciment, Michel (ed.) ''Elia Kazan: An American Odyssey'', Bloomsbury Publ. U.K. (1988) p. 231</ref>}}\n\nHe also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:\n\n{{quote|I think you and I, all of us, have some sort of stake in the United States. If it fails, the failure will be that of us all. Of mankind itself. It will cost us all.&nbsp; ... I think of the United States as a country which is an arena and in that arena there is a drama being played out.&nbsp; ... I have seen that the struggle is the struggle of free men.<ref name=Ciment1/>}}\n\nElia Kazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment, September 28, 2003, aged 94.\n\n==Legacy==\nKazan became known as an \"actor's director\" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 21 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars.\nHe won as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947) and for ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954). Both ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951) and ''On the Waterfront'' were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight.\n\n[[File:Seated-Splendor-Stevens.JPG|thumb|left|On the set of ''Splendor in the Grass'' (1961)]]\nWith his many years with the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] and [[Actors Studio]] in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous \"for the power and intensity of his actors' performances.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of [[Marlon Brando]], [[James Dean]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Karl Malden]], and many others. Seven of Kazan's films won a total of 20 [[Academy Awards]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] commented that he \"doubted whether he, [[Robert De Niro]], or [[Al Pacino]], would have become actors without Mr. Kazan's influence.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nUpon his death, at the age of 94, the ''New York Times'' described him as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/> The ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career \"he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations\", adding that \"he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema\".<ref name=Kazan1/> Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the [[Wesleyan University]] Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.<ref>http://www.wesleyan.edu/cinema/</ref>\n\nHis controversial stand during his testimony in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) in 1952, became the low point in his career, although he remained convinced that he made the right decision to give the names of Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that \"I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn't betray it. I made a difficult decision.\"<ref name=Kazan1/>\n\nDuring his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]], who wrote ''On the Waterfront'', thanked his lifelong friend saying, \"Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] has directed a film documentary, ''[[A Letter to Elia]]''  (2010), considered to be an \"intensely personal and deeply moving tribute\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdsporch.org/archives/tag/martin-scorsese |title=Full Frame Benefit Screening of Martin Scorsese's \"A Letter to Elia\" |publisher=CDSPorch.org |date=Nov 16, 2010 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref> to Kazan.

After attending [[Williams College]] and then the [[Yale]] School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in 1932, and co-founded the [[Actors Studio]] in 1947. With [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]] and [[Cheryl Crawford]], his actors' studio introduced \"[[Method Acting]]\" under the direction of [[Lee Strasberg]]. Kazan acted in a few films, including ''[[City for Conquest]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/282564%7C282565/Robert-Osborne-on-Method-Acting.html|title=Robert Osborne on Method Acting|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=2017-10-03}}</ref>\n\nNoted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), and ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director, three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. He also received an Honorary Oscar.\n\nHis films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\"<ref name=Stevens/> His first such \"issue\" film was ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), with [[Gregory Peck]], which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'', one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was [[Marlon Brando]]'s breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', which introduced [[James Dean]] to movie audiences.\n\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in 1952 at the time of the [[Hollywood blacklist]], which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues [[Morris Carnovsky]] and [[Art Smith (actor)|Art Smith]], along with the work of playwright [[Clifford Odets]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/movies/a-mccarthy-era-memory-that-can-still-chill.html \"A McCarthy Era Memory That Can Still Chill] ''New York Times'', January 16, 1997</ref> The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee.<ref>Kazan, Elia, ''A Life''.

Kazan notes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that \"it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to [[Istanbul]] ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances ...

''Kazan: The Master Director Discusses his Films'', Newmarket Press N.Y. (1999) pp. 272\u2013273</ref>\n\nKazan notes some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film. He writes \"I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.\"<ref name=Young/> To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:\n\n{{quote|text=I hesitated about that for a long time.

To oppressed people, America is still a dream.<ref name=Young/>}}\n\nBefore undertaking the film, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a \"deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'\" His mother gave him the answer, however: \"A.E. brought us here.\" Kazan states that \"A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey.

They were called the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages.

Rapf.<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|23}}\n\nIn Kazan's autobiography, he writes of the \"lasting impact on him of the Group,\" noting in particular, [[Lee Strasberg]] and [[Harold Clurman]] as \"father figures\", along with his close friendship with playwright [[Clifford Odets]]. Kazan, during an interview with Michel Ciment, describes the Group:\n:The Group was the best thing professionally that ever happened to me. I met two wonderful men. Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, both of whom were around thirty years old. They were magnetic, fearless leaders.

In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by [[Clifford Odets]], ''Waiting for Lefty'', and his performance was called \"dynamic,\" leading some to describe him as the \"proletarian thunderbolt.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|23}}\n\nAmong the themes that would run through all of his work were \"personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice\", writes film critic William Baer.<ref name=Kazan1/> Other critics have likewise noted his \"strong commitment to the social and social psychological\u2014rather than the purely political\u2014implications of drama\".<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|33}}\n\nBy the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including [[Robert Ardrey]]'s well-known play ''[[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]]''. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by [[Thornton Wilder]], ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and [[Fredric March]]. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Kazan won the [[New York Drama Critics Award]] for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]], and then directed ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' by [[Tennessee Williams]], both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a \"prize that launched his career.\"<ref name=Lahr>Lahr, John.

Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: [[Harry Morgan]], [[John Garfield]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Will Geer]], [[Howard Da Silva]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Lee J. Cobb]] and [[Irwin Shaw]].<ref>Clifford Odets: American Playwright: The Years from 1906 to 1940, p. 410</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |title=Pinewood Lake website retrieved on 2010-09-10 |access-date=September 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727174723/http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123</ref>\n\n===Actors Studio===\n\nIn 1947, he founded the [[Actors Studio]], a non-profit workshop, with actors [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]] and [[Cheryl Crawford]]. In 1951, [[Lee Strasberg]] became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the \"[[Method acting|Method]]\" to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s teachings. The \"Method\" school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.\n\nAmong Strasberg's students were [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Mildred Dunnock]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Maureen Stapleton]], [[Eli Wallach]], and [[James Whitmore]]. \nKazan directed two of the Studio's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Karl Malden and [[Marlon Brando]], in the [[Tennessee Williams]] play ''A Streetcar Named Desire''.\n\n==Film career==\nThough at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'', where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, [[antisemitism]], for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1949 he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'', which dealt with issues of racism in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.\n\nIn 1947, he directed the courtroom drama ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang!]]'', and in 1950 he directed ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'', starring [[Richard Widmark]], in a thriller shot on the streets of [[New Orleans]]. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in \"energizing\" the action scenes.<ref name=Freer/> He won the [[Venice Film Festival]] International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that [[Zero Mostel]] also act in the film, despite Mostel being \"blacklisted\" as a result of [[HUAC]] testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:\n:Each director has a favorite in his cast, ... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel ... I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met ... I constantly sought his company ... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the \"industry's\" blacklist ... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|383}}\n\n[[File:Brando - Leigh - 1951.jpg|thumb|Brando and Vivien Leigh in a scene from ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1951)]]\nIn 1951, after introducing and directing [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Karl Malden]] in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', which won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12.\n\nDespite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, but he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:\n\n:On \"Streetcar\" we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.<ref name=Stevens/><ref name=Freer/>\n\nKazan's next film was ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his \"first real film\" because of those factors.<ref name=Freer/>\n\nIn 1954 he again used Brando as a star in ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.  As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for 12 [[Academy Awards]], and won 8, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], for Marlon Brando.\n\n''On the Waterfront'' was also the screen debut for [[Eva Marie Saint]], who won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:\n\n{{quote|text=I ended up crying. Crying and laughing ... I mean there was such an attraction there ... That smile of his ... He was very tender and funny ... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.<ref name=Schickel>Schickel, Richard. ''Elia Kazan: A Biography'', HarperCollins (2005).</ref>{{rp|295\u2013296}}}}\n\n''Life'' magazine described ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' as the \"most brutal movie of the year\" but with \"the year's tenderest love scenes,\" and stating that Saint was a \"new discovery\" in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in ''On the Waterfront'' that she \"starts her real trip to fame.\"<ref>''Life'' magazine, July 19, 1954 pp. 45\u201350</ref>\n\nThe film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer [[Leonard Bernstein]].\n\n[[File:James Dean in East of Eden trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|<center>James Dean in ''East of Eden''</center>]]\nAfter the success of ''On the Waterfront'' he went on to direct the screen adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel, ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' in 1955. As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, [[James Dean]]. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag.<ref name=Springer>Springer, Claudia. ''James Dean Transfigured: The Many Faces of Rebel Iconography'', Univ. of Texas Press (2007)</ref>{{rp|194}} The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), directed by Kazan's friend, [[Nicholas Ray]], and then ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'', (dir. George Stevens, 1956)\n\nAuthor Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he \"kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.\"<ref name=Rathgeb>Rathgeb, Douglas L. ''The Making of Rebel Without a Cause'', McFarland (2004) p. 20</ref> As a result, Kazan was forced to \"baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers,\" so he wouldn't run away during production. Co-star [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that \"his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears.\"\n\nDean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director [[Nicholas Ray]] to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in ''Rebel Without a Cause''. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. \"Dean himself did not seem to believe it,\" notes Rathgeb. \"He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.\"<ref name=Rathgeb/>\n\nThe film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with an effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was ''East of Eden''.\n\nIn 1961, he introduced [[Warren Beatty]] in his first screen appearance with a starring role in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'' (1961), with [[Natalie Wood]]; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author [[Peter Biskind]] points out that Kazan \"was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.\"<ref name=Biskind>Biskind, Peter. ''Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America'', Simon & Schuster (2010) pp. 24\u201333</ref> Biskind notes also that they \"were wildly dissimilar\u2014mentor vs. prot\u00e9g\u00e9, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.\"<ref name=Biskind/>  Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:\n\n:Warren\u2014it was obvious the first time I saw him\u2014wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|603}}\n\nBiskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: \"The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HUAC. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something\u2014why did you name all those names?'\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\nBeatty recalled the episode: \"In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.\" Biskind describes how \"Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.\"<ref name=Biskind/> Beatty, years later, during a [[Kennedy Center]] tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan \"had given him the most important break in his career.\"<ref name=Biskind/>{{rp|23}}\n\nBeatty's costar, [[Natalie Wood]], was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer [[Suzanne Finstad]] notes that a \"turning point\" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'': \"She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie.\"<ref name=Finstad>Finstad, Suzanne. ''Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood'', Three Rivers Press (2001)</ref>{{rp|107}} In 1961, after a \"series of bad films, her career was already in decline,\" notes Rathgeb.<ref name=Rathgeb/>{{rp|199}} Kazan writes that the \"sages\" of the film community declared her as \"washed up\" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n\n:When I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J., I said to myself. I liked [[Robert Wagner|Bob Wagner]], I still do.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|602}}\n\nKazan cast her as the female lead in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'', and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, \"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on ''Splendor.''\"<ref name=Finstad/>{{rp|259}} She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of \"Kazan's wizardry ...  produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.\"<ref name=Finstad/>{{rp|260}}\n\nActor [[Gary Lockwood]], who also acted in the film, felt that \"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.\" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). \"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,\" writes Kazan.<ref name=Finstad/>{{rp|263}} \"And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.\"\n\n===Screenwriters===\nKazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[William Inge]]; in film, he worked again with Willams (''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''Baby Doll''), Inge (''Splendor in the Grass''), [[Budd Schulberg]] (''On the Waterfront'' and ''A Face in the Crowd''), [[John Steinbeck]] (''Viva Zapata!''), and [[Harold Pinter]] (''The Last Tycoon''). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, \"he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, ''[[The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond]]'', was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/11/unproduced-tennessee-williams-screenplay-finally-reaching-screens.html \"Unproduced Tennessee Williams screenplay finally reaching movie theaters\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 25, 2009</ref>\n\nWilliams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of \"creative slumps\" by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, \"Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.\"<ref name=Lahr/>\n\nAmong Kazan's other films were ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), ''East of Eden'' (1955), ''Baby Doll'' (1956), ''Wild River'' (1960), and ''The Last Tycoon'' (1976).\n\n==Literary career==\n{{expand section|date=July 2013}}\nIn between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including ''[[America America]]'' and ''[[The Arrangement (novel)|The Arrangement]]'', both of which tell the story of Kazan's Greek immigrant ancestors. Both novels were later made into films.\n\n==Directing style==\n\n===Preference for unknown actors===\nKazan strove for \"cinematic realism,\" a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict \"social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure.<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/news/la-et-casting-directors-20110221,0,5907423.story \"Countdown to the Oscars: No Oscar love for casting directors\"] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2011</ref> As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as [[Lee Remick]], [[Jo Van Fleet]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[James Dean]], and [[Jack Palance]], their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer [[George Stevens, Jr.]] that he felt that \"big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits ... they're not pliable anymore.\" Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:<ref name=Stevens>Stevens, George Jr. ''Conversations with the Great Moviemakers of Hollywood's Golden Age'', Alfred A. Knopf (2006) pp. 389\u2013408</ref>\n\n:Now what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nKazan goes on to describe how he got to understand James Dean, as an example:\n\n:When I met him he said, \"I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike{{nbsp}}...\" It was his way of communicating with me, saying \"I hope you like me,{{nbsp}}...\" I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love ... I went to [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, \"Go ahead.\"<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n===Topics of personal and social realism===\nKazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:\n\n:I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With ''East of Eden'' ... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time ... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kazan-Face-still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andy Griffith]], in first film role, with [[Patricia Neal]], from ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957) {{pufc|Kazan-Face-still.jpg|date=June 10, 2014}}]] -->\nFilm historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on \"reality\", although his style was not defined as \"naturalistic.\" She adds: \"He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.\"<ref name=Rapf>Rapf, Joanna E. ''On the Waterfront'', Cambridge Univ. Press (2003)</ref>{{rp|33}} Kazan states that \"unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|33}}\n\nIn his later years he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a\n\"collective art,\" as he once believed:\n\n:To be successful it should express the vision, the conviction, and the insistent presence of one person.<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nFilm author [[Peter Biskind]] described Kazan's career as \"fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|22}} Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:\n\n:I don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal ... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|22}}\n\nNonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', written by screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]], which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> Another political film was ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957). His protagonist, played by [[Andy Griffith]] (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn \"of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation.\" Kazan states, \"Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.\"<ref>Keyishian, Harry. ''Screening Politics: The Politician in American Movies'', Rowman & Littlefield (2003) p. 62</ref>\n\n===Use of \"Method\" acting===\n\nAs a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of [[method acting|\"Method\" actors]], especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, \"I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance ''including'' so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends ... The director is a ''desperate beast!'' ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> Actor [[Robert De Niro]] called him a \"master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nKazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:\n\n:I don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me ... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience ... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors ... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nHe explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:\n\n:When I talk to the actors they begin to give me ideas, and I grab them because the ideas they give me turn them on. I want the breath of life from them rather than the mechanical fulfillment of the movement which I asked for ... I love actors. I used to be an actor for eight years, so I do appreciate their job.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\nKazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes, and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in ''[[Baby Doll]]'', for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Carroll Baker]], he privately asked Wallach, \"Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?\" Wallach writes, \"I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'\" Kazan replies, \"Good idea, play it that way.\"<ref name=Wallach>Wallach, Eli. ''The Good, the Bad, and Me: In My Anecdotage'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2005) p. 172</ref> Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:\n\n:What is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act ... The scene on the swings (Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker) in ''Baby Doll'' is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.<ref>Young, Jeff. ''Kazan: The Master Director Discusses his films \u2013 Interviews with Elia Kazan'', Newmarket Press (1999) p. 224</ref>\n\n===Being an \"actor's director\"===\nJoanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director [[Nicholas Ray]] considered him \"the best actor's director the United States has ever produced.\"<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|22}} Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that \"he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method ... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism.\"<ref name=Hirsch>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/17/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood17-2010feb17 \"Elia Kazan, an actor's director\"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 17, 2010</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were [[Patricia Neal]], who co-starred with [[Andy Griffith]] in ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957): \"He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.\"<ref name=Hirsch/> [[Anthony Franciosa]], a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:\n\n:He would always say, 'Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.' You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side\u2014no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence ... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.<ref>Salvi, Delia. ''Friendly Enemies: Maximizing the Director-Actor Relationship'', Watson-Guptill (2002) pp. 239\u2013240</ref>\n\nHowever, in order to get quality acting from [[Andy Griffith]], in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls \"an astonishing movie debut,\"<ref name=Schickel/>{{rp|338}} Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: \"I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.\"<ref>Williamson, Jerry Wayne. ''Hillbillyland: What the Movies Did to the Mountains and What the Mountains Did to the Movies'', Univ. of North Carolina Press Books (1995) p. 168</ref>\n\nActress [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] calls Kazan her \"best friend,\" and notes that \"he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life.\"<ref name=Hirsch/> \"He would find out if your life was like the character,\" says [[Carroll Baker]], star of ''Baby Doll'', \"he was the best director with actors.\"<ref name=Hirsch/>\n\nKazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'' (1976). He remembers that [[Robert De Niro]], the star of the film, \"would do almost anything to succeed,\" and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro \"is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.\"<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|766}}\n\nThe powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits.  Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, \"Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.\"<ref name=Kazan1/>{{rp|210}} Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film.<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|766}} Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that \"for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of [[Vito Corleone]] in [[The Godfather Part II|''The Godfather, part II'']], ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest.\"<ref>Brenner, Marie. \"Tender is the Plight\", ''Texas Monthly'', January 1977.</ref>\n\n[[Marlon Brando]], in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:\n:I have worked with many movie directors\u2014some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for ... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me ... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation ... He gave his cast freedom and ... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect ... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg ... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.\n\n:He was an arch-manipulator of actors' feelings, and he was extraordinarily talented; perhaps we will never see his like again.<ref name=Brando>Brando, Marlon; Lindsey, Robert.

Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] members who he said had been Communists: [[Clifford Odets]], [[J. Edward Bromberg]], Lewis Leverett, [[Morris Carnovsky]], [[Phoebe Brand]], Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and [[Paula Strasberg|Paula Miller]], who later married [[Lee Strasberg]].

Kazan was already \"denied accolades\" from the [[American Film Institute]], and other film critics' associations. According to Mills, \"It's time for the Academy to recognize this genius,\" adding that \"We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.\"<ref name=Mills/> In response, former vice president of the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], Joseph McBride, claimed that an honorary award recognizes \"the totality of what he represents, and Kazan's career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people's careers.\"<ref>Weinraub, Bernard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/movies/a-mccarthy-era-memory-that-can-still-chill.html \"New York Times\"]</ref>\n\nIn later interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first \"family,\" and the \"best thing professionally\" that ever happened to him:\n\n:The Group Theatre said that we shouldn't be committed to any fixed political program set by other people outside the organization. I was behaving treacherously to the Group when I met downtown at CP [Communist Party] headquarters, to decide among the Communists what we should do in the Group, and then come back and present a united front, pretending we had not been in caucus ... \n:I was tried by the Party and that was one of the reasons I became so embittered later. The trial was on the issue of my refusal to follow instructions, that we should strike in the Group Theatre, and insist that the membership have control of its organization. I said it was an artistic organization, and I backed up Clurman and Strasberg who were not Communists ... The trial left an indelible impression on me ... Everybody else voted against me and they stigmatized me and condemned my acts and attitude. They were asking for confession and self-humbling. I went home that night and told my wife \"I am resigning.\" But for years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. I still believed in it. But not in the American Communists. I used to make a difference and think: \"These people here are damned fools but in Russia they have got the real thing,\" until I learned about the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]], and gave up on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].<ref>Ciment 1974:&nbsp;22</ref>\n\nMills notes that prior to becoming a \"friendly witness,\" Kazan discussed the issues with Miller:\n:To defend a secrecy I don't think right and to defend people who have already been named or soon would be by someone else ... I hate the Communists and have for many years, and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.<ref name=Mills/>\n\nMiller put his arm around Kazan and retorted, \"Don't worry about what I'll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.\"<ref name=Mills/>\n\nIn his memoirs, Kazan writes that his testimony meant that \"the big shot had become the outsider.\" He also notes that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, [[Tennessee Williams]], with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams \"the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.\"<ref name=Kazan/>{{rp|495}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\n[[File:Elia Kazan NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Elia Kazan in 1967]]\nElia Kazan was married three times.<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/> His first wife was playwright [[Molly Kazan|Molly Day Thacher]]. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter [[Nicholas Kazan]]. His second marriage, to the actress [[Barbara Loden]], lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to [[Frances Kazan|Frances Rudge]] continued until his death, in 2003, aged 94.\n\nIn 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to Kazan's birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:\n\n{{quote|In my own view, the solution is to talk about human beings and not about abstracts, to reveal the culture and the social moment as it is reflected in the behavior and the lives of individual people. Not to be \"correct.\" To be total. So I do not believe in any ideology that does not permit\u2014no encourage\u2014the freedom of the individual.<ref name=Ciment1>Ciment, Michel (ed.) ''Elia Kazan: An American Odyssey'', Bloomsbury Publ. U.K. (1988) p. 231</ref>}}\n\nHe also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:\n\n{{quote|I think you and I, all of us, have some sort of stake in the United States. If it fails, the failure will be that of us all. Of mankind itself. It will cost us all.&nbsp; ...

I have seen that the struggle is the struggle of free men.<ref name=Ciment1/>}}\n\nElia Kazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment, September 28, 2003, aged 94.\n\n==Legacy==\nKazan became known as an \"actor's director\" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 21 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars.\nHe won as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947) and for ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954). Both ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951) and ''On the Waterfront'' were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight.\n\n[[File:Seated-Splendor-Stevens.JPG|thumb|left|On the set of ''Splendor in the Grass'' (1961)]]\nWith his many years with the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] and [[Actors Studio]] in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous \"for the power and intensity of his actors' performances.\"<ref name=Kazan1/> He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of [[Marlon Brando]], [[James Dean]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Karl Malden]], and many others. Seven of Kazan's films won a total of 20 [[Academy Awards]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] commented that he \"doubted whether he, [[Robert De Niro]], or [[Al Pacino]], would have become actors without Mr. Kazan's influence.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\nUpon his death, at the age of 94, the ''New York Times'' described him as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/> The ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career \"he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations\", adding that \"he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema\".<ref name=Kazan1/> Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the [[Wesleyan University]] Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.<ref>http://www.wesleyan.edu/cinema/</ref>\n\nHis controversial stand during his testimony in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) in 1952, became the low point in his career, although he remained convinced that he made the right decision to give the names of Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that \"I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn't betray it. I made a difficult decision.\"<ref name=Kazan1/>\n\nDuring his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]], who wrote ''On the Waterfront'', thanked his lifelong friend saying, \"Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.\"<ref name=\"Rothstein\"/>\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] has directed a film documentary, ''[[A Letter to Elia]]''  (2010), considered to be an \"intensely personal and deeply moving tribute\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdsporch.org/archives/tag/martin-scorsese |title=Full Frame Benefit Screening of Martin Scorsese's \"A Letter to Elia\" |publisher=CDSPorch.org |date=Nov 16, 2010 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref> to Kazan.

{"title_page": "Break of gauge", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2016}}\n{{Sidebar track gauge}}\nWith railways, a '''break of gauge''' occurs where a line of one [[rail gauge|gauge]] meets a line of a different gauge: specifically a different [[track gauge]]. Trains and [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] cannot run through without some form of [[bogie exchange|conversion between gauges]], and [[Cargo|freight]] and [[passenger]]s must otherwise be [[Transloading|transshipped]]. A break of gauge adds delays, cost, and inconvenience.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[Image:Gauge changing in Brest, Belarus 08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bogie exchange|Exchanging bogies]] at [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] on the [[Belarus\u2013Poland border|Belarusian-Polish border]]]]\n* Narrow-gauge railways often have smaller [[loading gauge]]s and sharper curves, which tend to reduce initial [[capital cost]]s. These railways were often economically marginal lines, perhaps through hilly and mountainous terrain, where it would not have been economic to build a full-size railway. Many of these rail lines were operated independently of potentially connecting lines, as competing companies built and operated them. Thus the cost of transfer between different gauges was often irrelevant. Only the building of union stations or the nationalization of railroads changed this.\n*Invading armies may be severely hampered (as when Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the USSR in World War II). Spain (which had been invaded by [[Napoleon]]) deliberately maintained a wider gauge than France for this reason. This did not change until the beginning of the high-speed, standard-gauge [[AVE]] in 1992. The rest of the network continues to run on wide gauge.\n*If the railways also have different loading gauges, the break of track gauge might help prevent the larger wagons straying onto lines with smaller tunnels.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70044948 |title=Tramway League. |newspaper=[[South Bourke and Mornington Journal]] |location=Richmond, Vic. |date=February 4, 1885 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |page=3 Edition: Weekly. |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n*Similarly, if the larger and smaller gauges use different couplers or brakes, the break of gauge tends to keep the different couplers separate.\n\n====For passengers====\nFor passenger trains the inconvenience is less, especially at major stations where many passengers change trains or end their journeys anyway. Therefore, some passenger-only railways have been built with gauges not otherwise used in the country concerned. For example, the high-speed railways (and some [[rapid transit]] lines) in Japan and Spain use {{RailGauge|1435mm|lk=on}} while their respective mainline railroad systems use {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} and {{RailGauge|1668mm|lk=on}}.\n\nFor night trains, which are very common in countries such as Russia, the requirement to change trains is more inconvenient. In this case, often the [[bogie]]s are [[Bogie exchange|replaced]], even if it takes much more time than having passengers change trains.\n\n====For towns along the lines====\nIf local government has influence over the construction of railways, some may see it as desirable for trains (and passengers) to stop in rather than pass through their town. For instance, prior to the US Civil War, many cities in the South had a break of gauge or two separate stations at different ends of town, necessitating a change of trains or time-consuming transshipment, which nonetheless brought commerce and profit to the towns. Not until the Civil War did state and Confederate authorities notice the military and economic problems this brought, and only the post-bellum Union government was able to largely solve those problems, by converting almost all lines to standard gauge.\n\n==={{anchor|Inconvenience}}Disadvantages===\n[[File:Bogies-exchange.jpg|thumb|[[Bogie exchange|Exchanging bogies]] at [[Ussuriysk]] (near [[Vladivostok]]) on the Chinese&ndash;Russian border]]\n[[File:001015 gauge buster.jpg|thumb|A [[transporter wagon]]: one solution to the break-of-gauge problem]]\n\nTransshipping freight from cars of one gauge to cars of another is very labour- and time-intensive, and increases the risk of damage to goods. If the capacity of the freight cars on both systems does not match, additional inefficiencies can arise. If the frequency is low, a train might need to wait a long time for its counterpart to arrive before transshipping. This might be avoided by storing the goods, but that is also costly and inconvenient.\n\nTechnical solutions to avoid transshipping include [[Variable gauge|variable gauge axles]], replacing the [[bogie]]s of cars, and using transporter cars that can carry a car of a different gauge.\n\nThe Spanish manufacturers ''[[Talgo]]'' and ''[[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]]'' have developed dual-gauge axles ([[Variable gauge|variable gauge axles]]) which permit through running between broad-gauge and standard-gauge lines. In Japan the ''[[Gauge Change Train]]'', built on Talgo patents{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, runs on both standard and narrow {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n\nBreaks-of-gauge might also be avoided by installing [[dual gauge|dual-gauge]] track, either permanently or as part of a project to replace one gauge with another.\n\nAt most breaks-of-gauge passengers have to change trains, but there are a few trains that run through, for example, the Talgo (variable-gauge axles, see above), and trains from Russia to China or Russia to Europe ([[bogie exchange]]), although on the latter two the passengers usually have to leave the train for some time whilst the accommodation work is done.\n\n====When buying trains====\nRailroads with unusual gauges or loading gauges have problems procuring trains, and may be forced to choose between an oligopoly or even a monopoly supplier that caters to their specific needs. This may be deliberate on the part of suppliers: some streetcar lines were built to unique specifications to ensure buyer lock-in. However, in modern times rail gauge itself is often not the most important factor, but rather other aspects like the electrification system or the loading gauge. Trains crossing the [[Channel Tunnel]], for instance, had to be custom made before [[High Speed 1]] was built, despite both Britain and France having standard gauge, because the British loading gauge is narrower and the legacy lines in the south of Britain were electrified through third rail rather than overhead wiring.\n\n==Overcoming a break of gauge==\n[[File:Break of gauge GWR Gloucester.jpg|thumb|A cartoon depicting the horrors of goods transfer at the break of gauge at Gloucester in 1843]]\n\nWhere trains encounter a different gauge, such as at the Spanish\u2013French border or the Russian\u2013Chinese one, the traditional solution has been [[transloading]] ([[transloading#Transloading versus transshipment|often called transshipment in discussions of break of gauge]]), that is, the transfer of passengers and freight to cars on the other system. When transloading from one gauge to another, often the quantities of rolling stock are unbalanced between the two systems, leading to more idle rolling stock on one system than the other. This is obviously far from optimal, and some other schemes have been devised.\n\nVarious solutions other than transloading were conceived even in the early era of railways in Britain<ref name=\"Rolt1989\">{{Harvnb|Rolt|1989}}.</ref>{{rp|202\u2013203}} (including [[rollbock]]s, [[transporter wagon]]s, [[dual gauge]], and even [[containerization]] or [[variable gauge]] axles), but they were not implemented during the nastiest flare-up of the [[Gauge War]] in the 1840s, which resulted in horrendous spectacles of confused and wasteful transloading.<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s biography of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (mastermind of the broad gauge) remarks on the apparent mysteriousness of this lack of implementation,<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} but a likely explanation is that the combatants at the time were more interested in winning the Gauge War, defeating the other gauge, than in demonstrating how peaceful coexistence could be developed. Rolt states that the shocking confusion seen in an [[editorial cartoon]] of transloading chaos at [[Gloucester]] in 1843 was deliberately [[wikt:contrived#Adjective|contrived]], as later admitted by a railway [[cargo|goods]] manager, as a [[spectacle]] for a visiting parliamentary committee.<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} Rolt states that the germ of the idea of [[containerization]] was known even at this time,<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} which is interesting in that the full potential of containerization was not thoroughly developed until a century later, after [[World War II]].\n\nLack of a standard gauge was a significant problem in transportation in the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Bogie exchange and variable gauge===\n{{main|Bogie exchange|Variable gauge}}\nOne common method to avoid transshipment is to build cars to the smaller of the two systems' [[loading gauge]]s with bogies that are easily removed and replaced with other bogies at an [[Bogie exchange|interchange]] location on the border. This takes a few minutes per car, but is quicker than [[Transloading#Transloading facilities|transshipment]] of goods.\n\nA more modern and sophisticated method is to have multigauge bogies whose wheels can be [[Variable gauge|moved inward and outward]]. Normally they are locked in place, but special equipment at the border unlocks the wheels and pushes them inward or outward to the new gauge, relocking the wheels when done. This can be done as the train moves slowly over special equipment.\n\n===Dual gauge and track gauge conversion===\n{{main|Dual gauge|Track gauge conversion}}\nIn some cases, breaks of gauge are avoided by installing dual-gauge track, either permanently or as part of a [[Track gauge conversion|changeover process]] to a single gauge.\n\n===Piggyback operation===\n{{main|Rollbock|Transporter wagon}}\nOne method of achieving interoperability between [[rolling stock]] of different gauges is to [[Piggyback (transportation)#Rail|piggyback]] stock of one gauge on special transporter wagons or even ordinary flat wagons fitted with rails. This enables rolling stock to reach workshops and other lines of the same gauge to which they are not otherwise connected. [[Transporter wagon|Piggyback]] operation by the trainload occurred as a temporary measure between [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] and [[Marree railway station|Marree]] during [[gauge conversion]] work in the 1950s to bypass steep gradients and [[washaways]] in the [[Flinders Ranges]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/railways.htm|title=Piggyback picture}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/company.htm|title=FLINDERS RANGES RESEARCH}}</ref>\n\nNarrow-gauge railways were favoured in the underground slate quarries of [[North Wales]], as tunnels could be smaller. The [[Padarn Railway]] operated transporter wagons on their {{RailGauge|4ft|lk=on}} gauge railway, each carrying four {{RailGauge|1ft10.75in}} slate trams. When the [[Great Western Railway]] acquired one of the narrow-gauge lines in [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], it deployed a similar type of transporter wagon to allow continued use of the quarries' existing slate wagons.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Adrian |date= Winter 1994 |title=G. W. R. Slate Tram Transporter Wagons |journal=British Railway Journal |issue=50 |pages=17\u201324}}</ref>\n\nTransporter wagons are most commonly used to transport narrow-gauge stock along standard-gauge lines.\n\nAt the [[Guinness brewery]] in [[Dublin]] there used to be {{RailGauge|1ft10in}} internal narrow gauge and {{RailGauge|5ft3in|lk=on}} gauge (standard gauge for Ireland), and to avoid the need for steam locomotives of both gauges the narrow-gauge engines were provided with standard-gauge converter wagons (named \"haulage trucks\"). The narrow-gauge steam locomotive was lowered into the haulage truck using a gantry, and its wheels rested on rollers, which in turn drove the haulage wagon wheels via a 3:1 reduction gear. Several of these locomotives survived into preservation, including locomotive No23 complete with haulage wagon and lifting gantry preserved at Brockham museum in 1966, and now at the [[Amberley Museum Railway]].\n\nMore rarely, standard-gauge vehicles are carried over narrow-gauge tracks using adaptor vehicles; examples include the [[Rollbock]]e transporter wagon arrangements in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic, and the milk transporter wagons of the [[Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway]] in England.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, Japan is developing the [[Train on Train]] piggyback concept.\n\n===Containerisation===\n{{Main|Containerisation}} \nThe widespread use of [[Intermodal container#Rail|containers]] since the 1960s has made break of gauge less of a problem, since containers are efficiently transferred from one mode to another by suitable large [[Container crane|cranes]].\n\nIt helps if the lengths of the wagons on each gauge are the same so the containers can be transferred from one train to the other with no longitudinal movement along the trains. The different wagons should carry the same number of containers. Delays to each train depends on how many cranes can operate simultaneously.\n\nContainer cranes are relatively portable, so that if the break of gauge transshipment hub changes from time to time, the cranes can be moved around as required. [[Fork lift]] trucks can also be used.\n\nIt has been reported that, for example, when containers are shipped by a \"direct train\" from China to Europe, it is only containers, and not the railcars, which move from China's railway network to that of Kazakhstan. At the border station at [[Khorgos]], two trains (the Chinese {{RailGauge|sg|allk=on|disp=or}} one and the Kazakh {{RailGauge|1520mm|lk=on|disp=or}} one) would stand side by side at parallel tracks, while the cranes would move the containers from one train to the other in as short a time as 47 minutes.<ref name=forbes2016>{{cite|\nurl=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/01/28/why-china-europe-silk-road-rail-transport-is-growing-fast\n|date=2016-01-28\n|title=Why The China-Europe 'Silk Road' Rail Network Is Growing Fast\n|first=Wade |last=Shepard \n|periodical=Forbes \n}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n===Minor breaks of gauge===\nWherever there are narrow-gauge lines that connect with a standard-gauge line, there is technically a break of gauge. If the amount of traffic transferred between lines is small, this might be a small inconvenience only. In Austria and Switzerland there are numerous breaks-of-gauge between standard-gauge main lines and narrow-gauge railways.\n\nMany internal Swiss railways that operate in the more mountainous regions are {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}}, and most are equipped with [[rack railway|rack]] assistance to deal with the relatively steep gradients encountered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/switzerland/switzerland.gif|accessdate=2011-02-19|title=enlarged map}}</ref> Through running of standard-gauge trains on rack sections would not be possible, but dual-gauge track exists in many places where the gradient is relatively flat to carry standard- and metre-gauge stock. There are also some 800-mm-gauge railways which are entirely rack operated.\n\nThe effects of a minor break of gauge can be minimized by placing it at the point where a cargo must be removed from cars anyway. An example of this is the [[East Broad Top Railroad]] in the US, which had a [[coal breaker|coal wash and preparation plant]] at its break of gauge in [[Mount Union, Pennsylvania]]. The coal was unloaded from narrow-gauge cars of the EBTR, and after processing was loaded into standard-gauge cars of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].\n\n=== Nominal breaks of gauge ===\nThe line between Finland and Russia has a nominal break of gauge; Finnish gauge is {{RailGauge|1524mm|lk=on}} whereas [[Russian gauge]] is {{RailGauge|1520mm|lk=on}}. This does not usually prevent through-running, and in fact, such a service exists in the form of the [[Allegro (train)|Allegro]] high-speed service between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. The nominal {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} difference is generally within tolerance, and the present Russian gauge is actually a redefinition of the older {{RailGauge|1524mm}}.\n\nThe [[Iberian gauge]] is actually three slightly different gauges: {{RailGauge|1672mm}} in Spain, {{RailGauge|1664mm}} in Portugal, and the newer, redefined {{RailGauge|1668mm|lk=on}}. Through-running is done with vehicles having a gauge within certain tolerances. [[Indian gauge]], {{RailGauge|1676mm|lk=on}}, is also compatible with Iberian gauge, although there are no actual railway connections between the two. Despite this, old Spanish and Portuguese rolling stock have been reused in Argentina and Chile, both of which use Indian gauge.\n\nA nominal break of gauge with [[standard gauge]] exists as well: on the Hong Kong [[MTR]] network, lines owned by [[MTR Corporation]] use {{RailGauge|1432mm|lk=on}} rather than the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} employed on those owned by [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation|KCR Corporation]], despite the lack of physical connections between the two networks.\n\n=== Other types of breaks ===\nA large railway may have main lines with heavy tracks, and branch lines with light track. Light locomotives and rolling stock can operate on all lines, but heavy locomotives and rolling stock can only operate on heavy track.  Heavy rolling stock might be able to operate on lighter track at reduced speed.  Light track can be upgraded to heavy track by installing heavy rails, etc., and this can be done without changing the track gauge.\n\n==Gauge conversions==\n{{Main|Track gauge conversion}}\n\n===Gauge orphan===\nWhen a main line is converted to a different gauge, branch lines can be cut off and made relatively useless, at least for freight trains, until they too are converted to the new gauge. These severed branches can be called '''gauge orphans'''.\n\n===Gauge outreach===\nThe opposite of a gauge orphan is a line of one gauge which reaches into the territory composed mainly of another gauge. Examples include five broad-gauge lines from Victoria, Australia, which crossed the border into otherwise standard-gauge New South Wales. Similarly, the standard-gauge line from Albury to Melbourne in 1962 which eliminated most transshipment at Albury, especially the need for passengers to change trains in the middle of the night.\n\nTwo Russian broad-gauge lines reach out from Ukraine, one (the [[Uzhhorod\u2013Ko\u0161ice broad-gauge track|Uzhhorod\u2013Ko\u0161ice line]]) into Slovakia to carry minerals; another (the [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line|Metallurgy Line]]) into Poland to carry heavy iron ore and steel products without the need for transshipment as would be the case if there were a break of gauge at the border. There are plans to extend the Slovak line to Vienna.<ref name=broad-gauge-to-wien-2010/>\n\nIn 1994, the [[Rail Baltica]] proposal emerged to build a 728&nbsp;km north\u2013south line to link European standard-gauge railways from Poland to [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, and via [[Riga]], Latvia, to [[Tallinn]], Estonia.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] July 2011, p 25.</ref> In the shorter term (the 2010s) it will only be built to Kaunas.\n\nThe gauge outreach from [[Kalgoorlie]] to [[Perth]] partly replaced the original narrow-gauge line, and partly rebuilt that line with better curves and gradients as double-track dual gauge. Because of lack of space at the main Perth station, standard-gauge passenger trains terminate one station short at [[East Perth railway station|East Perth]].\n\n==Other issues==\nWhile track gauge is the most important factor preventing through running between adjacent systems, other issues can also be a hindrance, including [[structure gauge]], [[loading gauge]], [[axleload]]s, [[Railway coupling|couplings]], [[Railway brake#Air versus vacuum brakes|brakes]], [[railway electrification system|electrification systems]], [[railway signal|signalling]] systems, [[multiple unit]] controls, [[Safeworking|rules and regulations]], driver certification, righthand or lefthand running, repairs (how to make and pay for repairs while rolling stock is on other railway's territory) and language. The structure gauge, loading gauge and axleload problems are solved by simply using the smaller options for through running. The general solution is often to custom-build vehicles to fit all the standards to be encountered. Trains can be built to accept four voltages, to have dual signaling systems equipment, etc. All of these solutions, however, usually result in either more expensive trains or less comfort for passengers (e.g. through less room inside the train if it has a smaller loading gauge) or \u2013 in the case of freight railways \u2013 less room for cargo, making [[double-stack rail transport|double stacking]] impossible or other negative effects.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Europe===\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n* [[Gloucester]] was the earliest significant break of gauge between the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} and {{RailGauge|7ft0.25in|lk=on}} systems.\n* 1864 \u2013 [[Southern Railway routes west of Salisbury#Break of Gauge|Yeovil]]\n\n====Russian gauge meeting western gauge====\n[[File:Bogie change station at Chop station Ukraine.jpg|thumb|Bogie-exchange station in Ukraine]]\n* [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] ({{RailGauge|1435mm}}).\n:vs. Former Soviet Union countries: Russia, [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]],  [[Moldova]] ({{RailGauge|1520mm}}).

Trains and [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] cannot run through without some form of [[bogie exchange|conversion between gauges]], and [[Cargo|freight]] and [[passenger]]s must otherwise be [[Transloading|transshipped]]. A break of gauge adds delays, cost, and inconvenience.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[Image:Gauge changing in Brest, Belarus 08.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bogie exchange|Exchanging bogies]] at [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] on the [[Belarus\u2013Poland border|Belarusian-Polish border]]]]\n* Narrow-gauge railways often have smaller [[loading gauge]]s and sharper curves, which tend to reduce initial [[capital cost]]s. These railways were often economically marginal lines, perhaps through hilly and mountainous terrain, where it would not have been economic to build a full-size railway. Many of these rail lines were operated independently of potentially connecting lines, as competing companies built and operated them. Thus the cost of transfer between different gauges was often irrelevant. Only the building of union stations or the nationalization of railroads changed this.\n*Invading armies may be severely hampered (as when Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the USSR in World War II). Spain (which had been invaded by [[Napoleon]]) deliberately maintained a wider gauge than France for this reason. This did not change until the beginning of the high-speed, standard-gauge [[AVE]] in 1992. The rest of the network continues to run on wide gauge.\n*If the railways also have different loading gauges, the break of track gauge might help prevent the larger wagons straying onto lines with smaller tunnels.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70044948 |title=Tramway League. |newspaper=[[South Bourke and Mornington Journal]] |location=Richmond, Vic. |date=February 4, 1885 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |page=3 Edition: Weekly. |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n*Similarly, if the larger and smaller gauges use different couplers or brakes, the break of gauge tends to keep the different couplers separate.\n\n====For passengers====\nFor passenger trains the inconvenience is less, especially at major stations where many passengers change trains or end their journeys anyway. Therefore, some passenger-only railways have been built with gauges not otherwise used in the country concerned. For example, the high-speed railways (and some [[rapid transit]] lines) in Japan and Spain use {{RailGauge|1435mm|lk=on}} while their respective mainline railroad systems use {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} and {{RailGauge|1668mm|lk=on}}.\n\nFor night trains, which are very common in countries such as Russia, the requirement to change trains is more inconvenient. In this case, often the [[bogie]]s are [[Bogie exchange|replaced]], even if it takes much more time than having passengers change trains.\n\n====For towns along the lines====\nIf local government has influence over the construction of railways, some may see it as desirable for trains (and passengers) to stop in rather than pass through their town. For instance, prior to the US Civil War, many cities in the South had a break of gauge or two separate stations at different ends of town, necessitating a change of trains or time-consuming transshipment, which nonetheless brought commerce and profit to the towns. Not until the Civil War did state and Confederate authorities notice the military and economic problems this brought, and only the post-bellum Union government was able to largely solve those problems, by converting almost all lines to standard gauge.\n\n==={{anchor|Inconvenience}}Disadvantages===\n[[File:Bogies-exchange.jpg|thumb|[[Bogie exchange|Exchanging bogies]] at [[Ussuriysk]] (near [[Vladivostok]]) on the Chinese&ndash;Russian border]]\n[[File:001015 gauge buster.jpg|thumb|A [[transporter wagon]]: one solution to the break-of-gauge problem]]\n\nTransshipping freight from cars of one gauge to cars of another is very labour- and time-intensive, and increases the risk of damage to goods. If the capacity of the freight cars on both systems does not match, additional inefficiencies can arise. If the frequency is low, a train might need to wait a long time for its counterpart to arrive before transshipping. This might be avoided by storing the goods, but that is also costly and inconvenient.\n\nTechnical solutions to avoid transshipping include [[Variable gauge|variable gauge axles]], replacing the [[bogie]]s of cars, and using transporter cars that can carry a car of a different gauge.\n\nThe Spanish manufacturers ''[[Talgo]]'' and ''[[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]]'' have developed dual-gauge axles ([[Variable gauge|variable gauge axles]]) which permit through running between broad-gauge and standard-gauge lines. In Japan the ''[[Gauge Change Train]]'', built on Talgo patents{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, runs on both standard and narrow {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n\nBreaks-of-gauge might also be avoided by installing [[dual gauge|dual-gauge]] track, either permanently or as part of a project to replace one gauge with another.\n\nAt most breaks-of-gauge passengers have to change trains, but there are a few trains that run through, for example, the Talgo (variable-gauge axles, see above), and trains from Russia to China or Russia to Europe ([[bogie exchange]]), although on the latter two the passengers usually have to leave the train for some time whilst the accommodation work is done.\n\n====When buying trains====\nRailroads with unusual gauges or loading gauges have problems procuring trains, and may be forced to choose between an oligopoly or even a monopoly supplier that caters to their specific needs. This may be deliberate on the part of suppliers: some streetcar lines were built to unique specifications to ensure buyer lock-in. However, in modern times rail gauge itself is often not the most important factor, but rather other aspects like the electrification system or the loading gauge. Trains crossing the [[Channel Tunnel]], for instance, had to be custom made before [[High Speed 1]] was built, despite both Britain and France having standard gauge, because the British loading gauge is narrower and the legacy lines in the south of Britain were electrified through third rail rather than overhead wiring.\n\n==Overcoming a break of gauge==\n[[File:Break of gauge GWR Gloucester.jpg|thumb|A cartoon depicting the horrors of goods transfer at the break of gauge at Gloucester in 1843]]\n\nWhere trains encounter a different gauge, such as at the Spanish\u2013French border or the Russian\u2013Chinese one, the traditional solution has been [[transloading]] ([[transloading#Transloading versus transshipment|often called transshipment in discussions of break of gauge]]), that is, the transfer of passengers and freight to cars on the other system. When transloading from one gauge to another, often the quantities of rolling stock are unbalanced between the two systems, leading to more idle rolling stock on one system than the other. This is obviously far from optimal, and some other schemes have been devised.\n\nVarious solutions other than transloading were conceived even in the early era of railways in Britain<ref name=\"Rolt1989\">{{Harvnb|Rolt|1989}}.</ref>{{rp|202\u2013203}} (including [[rollbock]]s, [[transporter wagon]]s, [[dual gauge]], and even [[containerization]] or [[variable gauge]] axles), but they were not implemented during the nastiest flare-up of the [[Gauge War]] in the 1840s, which resulted in horrendous spectacles of confused and wasteful transloading.<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s biography of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (mastermind of the broad gauge) remarks on the apparent mysteriousness of this lack of implementation,<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} but a likely explanation is that the combatants at the time were more interested in winning the Gauge War, defeating the other gauge, than in demonstrating how peaceful coexistence could be developed. Rolt states that the shocking confusion seen in an [[editorial cartoon]] of transloading chaos at [[Gloucester]] in 1843 was deliberately [[wikt:contrived#Adjective|contrived]], as later admitted by a railway [[cargo|goods]] manager, as a [[spectacle]] for a visiting parliamentary committee.<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} Rolt states that the germ of the idea of [[containerization]] was known even at this time,<ref name=\"Rolt1989\"/>{{rp|202\u2013203}} which is interesting in that the full potential of containerization was not thoroughly developed until a century later, after [[World War II]].\n\nLack of a standard gauge was a significant problem in transportation in the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===Bogie exchange and variable gauge===\n{{main|Bogie exchange|Variable gauge}}\nOne common method to avoid transshipment is to build cars to the smaller of the two systems' [[loading gauge]]s with bogies that are easily removed and replaced with other bogies at an [[Bogie exchange|interchange]] location on the border. This takes a few minutes per car, but is quicker than [[Transloading#Transloading facilities|transshipment]] of goods.\n\nA more modern and sophisticated method is to have multigauge bogies whose wheels can be [[Variable gauge|moved inward and outward]]. Normally they are locked in place, but special equipment at the border unlocks the wheels and pushes them inward or outward to the new gauge, relocking the wheels when done. This can be done as the train moves slowly over special equipment.\n\n===Dual gauge and track gauge conversion===\n{{main|Dual gauge|Track gauge conversion}}\nIn some cases, breaks of gauge are avoided by installing dual-gauge] track, either permanently or as part of a [[Track gauge conversion|changeover process]] to a single gauge.\n\n===Piggyback operation===\n{{main|Rollbock|Transporter wagon}}\nOne method of achieving interoperability between [[rolling stock]] of different gauges is to [[Piggyback (transportation)#Rail|piggyback]] stock of one gauge on special transporter wagons or even ordinary flat wagons fitted with rails. This enables rolling stock to reach workshops and other lines of the same gauge to which they are not otherwise connected. [[Transporter wagon|Piggyback]] operation by the trainload occurred as a temporary measure between [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] and [[Marree railway station|Marree]] during [[gauge conversion]] work in the 1950s to bypass steep gradients and [[washaways]] in the [[Flinders Ranges]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/railways.htm|title=Piggyback picture}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/company.htm|title=FLINDERS RANGES RESEARCH}}</ref>\n\nNarrow-gauge railways were favoured in the underground slate quarries of [[North Wales]], as tunnels could be smaller. The [[Padarn Railway]] operated transporter wagons on their {{RailGauge|4ft|lk=on}} gauge railway, each carrying four {{RailGauge|1ft10.75in}} slate trams. When the [[Great Western Railway]] acquired one of the narrow-gauge lines in [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], it deployed a similar type of transporter wagon to allow continued use of the quarries' existing slate wagons.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Adrian |date= Winter 1994 |title=G. W. R. Slate Tram Transporter Wagons |journal=British Railway Journal |issue=50 |pages=17\u201324}}</ref>\n\nTransporter wagons are most commonly used to transport narrow-gauge stock along standard-gauge lines.\n\nAt the [[Guinness brewery]] in [[Dublin]] there used to be {{RailGauge|1ft10in}} internal narrow gauge and {{RailGauge|5ft3in|lk=on}} gauge (standard gauge for Ireland), and to avoid the need for steam locomotives of both gauges the narrow-gauge engines were provided with standard-gauge converter wagons (named \"haulage trucks\"). The narrow-gauge steam locomotive was lowered into the haulage truck using a gantry, and its wheels rested on rollers, which in turn drove the haulage wagon wheels via a 3:1 reduction gear. Several of these locomotives survived into preservation, including locomotive No23 complete with haulage wagon and lifting gantry preserved at Brockham museum in 1966, and now at the [[Amberley Museum Railway]].\n\nMore rarely, standard-gauge vehicles are carried over narrow-gauge tracks using adaptor vehicles; examples include the [[Rollbock]]e transporter wagon arrangements in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic, and the milk transporter wagons of the [[Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway]] in England.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, Japan is developing the [[Train on Train]] piggyback concept.\n\n===Containerisation===\n{{Main|Containerisation}} \nThe widespread use of [[Intermodal container#Rail|containers]] since the 1960s has made break of gauge less of a problem, since containers are efficiently transferred from one mode to another by suitable large [[Container crane|cranes]].\n\nIt helps if the lengths of the wagons on each gauge are the same so the containers can be transferred from one train to the other with no longitudinal movement along the trains. The different wagons should carry the same number of containers. Delays to each train depends on how many cranes can operate simultaneously.\n\nContainer cranes are relatively portable, so that if the break of gauge transshipment hub changes from time to time, the cranes can be moved around as required. [[Fork lift]] trucks can also be used.\n\nIt has been reported that, for example, when containers are shipped by a \"direct train\" from China to Europe, it is only containers, and not the railcars, which move from China's railway network to that of Kazakhstan. At the border station at [[Khorgos]], two trains (the Chinese {{RailGauge|sg|allk=on|disp=or}} one and the Kazakh {{RailGauge|1520mm|lk=on|disp=or}} one) would stand side by side at parallel tracks, while the cranes would move the containers from one train to the other in as short a time as 47 minutes.<ref name=forbes2016>{{cite|\nurl=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/01/28/why-china-europe-silk-road-rail-transport-is-growing-fast\n|date=2016-01-28\n|title=Why The China-Europe 'Silk Road' Rail Network Is Growing Fast\n|first=Wade |last=Shepard \n|periodical=Forbes \n}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n===Minor breaks of gauge===\nWherever there are narrow-gauge lines that connect with a standard-gauge line, there is technically a break of gauge. If the amount of traffic transferred between lines is small, this might be a small inconvenience only. In Austria and Switzerland there are numerous breaks-of-gauge between standard-gauge main lines and narrow-gauge railways.\n\nMany internal Swiss railways that operate in the more mountainous regions are {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}}, and most are equipped with [[rack railway|rack]] assistance to deal with the relatively steep gradients encountered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/switzerland/switzerland.gif|accessdate=2011-02-19|title=enlarged map}}</ref> Through running of standard-gauge trains on rack sections would not be possible, but dual-gauge track exists in many places where the gradient is relatively flat to carry standard- and metre-gauge stock. There are also some 800-mm-gauge railways which are entirely rack operated.\n\nThe effects of a minor break of gauge can be minimized by placing it at the point where a cargo must be removed from cars anyway. An example of this is the [[East Broad Top Railroad]] in the US, which had a [[coal breaker|coal wash and preparation plant]] at its break of gauge in [[Mount Union, Pennsylvania]]. The coal was unloaded from narrow-gauge cars of the EBTR, and after processing was loaded into standard-gauge cars of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].\n\n=== Nominal breaks of gauge ===\nThe line between Finland and Russia has a nominal break of gauge; Finnish gauge is {{RailGauge|1524mm|lk=on}} whereas [[Russian gauge]] is {{RailGauge|1520mm|lk=on}}. This does not usually prevent through-running, and in fact, such a service exists in the form of the [[Allegro (train)|Allegro]] high-speed service between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. The nominal {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} difference is generally within tolerance, and the present Russian gauge is actually a redefinition of the older {{RailGauge|1524mm}}.\n\nThe [[Iberian gauge]] is actually three slightly different gauges: {{RailGauge|1672mm}} in Spain, {{RailGauge|1664mm}} in Portugal, and the newer, redefined {{RailGauge|1668mm|lk=on}}. Through-running is done with vehicles having a gauge within certain tolerances. [[Indian gauge]], {{RailGauge|1676mm|lk=on}}, is also compatible with Iberian gauge, although there are no actual railway connections between the two. Despite this, old Spanish and Portuguese rolling stock have been reused in Argentina and Chile, both of which use Indian gauge.\n\nA nominal break of gauge with [[standard gauge]] exists as well: on the Hong Kong [[MTR]] network, lines owned by [[MTR Corporation]] use {{RailGauge|1432mm|lk=on}} rather than the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} employed on those owned by [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation|KCR Corporation]], despite the lack of physical connections between the two networks.\n\n=== Other types of breaks ===\nA large railway may have main lines with heavy tracks, and branch lines with light track. Light locomotives and rolling stock can operate on all lines, but heavy locomotives and rolling stock can only operate on heavy track.  Heavy rolling stock might be able to operate on lighter track at reduced speed.  Light track can be upgraded to heavy track by installing heavy rails, etc., and this can be done without changing the track gauge.\n\n==Gauge conversions==\n{{Main|Track gauge conversion}}\n\n===Gauge orphan===\nWhen a main line is converted to a different gauge, branch lines can be cut off and made relatively useless, at least for freight trains, until they too are converted to the new gauge. These severed branches can be called '''gauge orphans'''.\n\n===Gauge outreach===\nThe opposite of a gauge orphan is a line of one gauge which reaches into the territory composed mainly of another gauge. Examples include five broad-gauge lines from Victoria, Australia, which crossed the border into otherwise standard-gauge New South Wales. Similarly, the standard-gauge line from Albury to Melbourne in 1962 which eliminated most transshipment at Albury, especially the need for passengers to change trains in the middle of the night.\n\nTwo Russian broad-gauge lines reach out from Ukraine, one (the [[Uzhhorod\u2013Ko\u0161ice broad-gauge track|Uzhhorod\u2013Ko\u0161ice line]]) into Slovakia to carry minerals; another (the [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line|Metallurgy Line]]) into Poland to carry heavy iron ore and steel products without the need for transshipment as would be the case if there were a break of gauge at the border. There are plans to extend the Slovak line to Vienna.<ref name=broad-gauge-to-wien-2010/>\n\nIn 1994, the [[Rail Baltica]] proposal emerged to build a 728&nbsp;km north\u2013south line to link European standard-gauge railways from Poland to [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, and via [[Riga]], Latvia, to [[Tallinn]], Estonia.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] July 2011, p 25.</ref> In the shorter term (the 2010s) it will only be built to Kaunas.\n\nThe gauge outreach from [[Kalgoorlie]] to [[Perth]] partly replaced the original narrow-gauge line, and partly rebuilt that line with better curves and gradients as double-track dual gauge. Because of lack of space at the main Perth station, standard-gauge passenger trains terminate one station short at [[East Perth railway station|East Perth]].\n\n==Other issues==\nWhile track gauge is the most important factor preventing through running between adjacent systems, other issues can also be a hindrance, including [[structure gauge]], [[loading gauge]], [[axleload]]s, [[Railway coupling|couplings]], [[Railway brake#Air versus vacuum brakes|brakes]], [[railway electrification system|electrification systems]], [[railway signal|signalling]] systems, [[multiple unit]] controls, [[Safeworking|rules and regulations]], driver certification, righthand or lefthand running, repairs (how to make and pay for repairs while rolling stock is on other railway's territory) and language. The structure gauge, loading gauge and axleload problems are solved by simply using the smaller options for through running. The general solution is often to custom-build vehicles to fit all the standards to be encountered. Trains can be built to accept four voltages, to have dual signaling systems equipment, etc. All of these solutions, however, usually result in either more expensive trains or less comfort for passengers (e.g. through less room inside the train if it has a smaller loading gauge) or \u2013 in the case of freight railways \u2013 less room for cargo, making [[double-stack rail transport|double stacking]] impossible or other negative effects.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Europe===\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n* [[Gloucester]] was the earliest significant break of gauge between the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} and {{RailGauge|7ft0.25in|lk=on}} systems.\n* 1864 \u2013 [[Southern Railway routes west of Salisbury#Break of Gauge|Yeovil]]\n\n====Russian gauge meeting western gauge====\n[[File:Bogie change station at Chop station Ukraine.jpg|thumb|Bogie-exchange station in Ukraine]]\n* [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] ({{RailGauge|1435mm}}).\n:vs. Former Soviet Union countries: Russia, [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]],  [[Moldova]] ({{RailGauge|1520mm}}).

Private railways often use other gauges.\n\nWhile most of the Japanese urban rail/metro lines use {{RailGauge|1067mm}} rail gauge, a considerable number of lines (including all lines of the [[Osaka Metro]]) are still using their own different gauges including {{RailGauge|762mm}}, {{RailGauge|1372mm}}, and {{RailGauge|1435mm}}.<ref>http://www.jterc.or.jp/topics/josei_shinpo3.14/5_chokutu_unten.pdf</ref> This prevented the creation of some [[through train]] services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sc.city.kawasaki.jp/faq/contents_detail.php?frmId=12992|title=\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02\uff1a\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093|website=sc.city.kawasaki.jp}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Hokkaido Railway Company]] (JR Hokkaido) started working on a transporter train by trainload concept called \"[[Train on Train]]\" to carry narrow-gauge freight trains at faster speeds on standard-gauge flatcars. The [[Seikan Tunnel]] has beien converted by JR Hokkaido to dual gauge to accommodate the [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]].\n\nAn experimental variable gauge \"[[Gauge Change Train]]\" has also been tested since 1998 as a means to allow through services from high-speed standard-gauge Shinkansen lines to narrow-gauge regional lines. Its first deployment is expected to be [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] Nagasaki route.\n\n====North Korea====\nThe [[Rail transport in North Korea|North Korea]]n rail system has some breaks of gauge. Several parts of the [[Paektusan Ch'\u014fngny\u014fn Line]] on the stretch between Wiy\u014fn and Hyesan Ch'\u014fngny\u014fn are dual gauged to allow connections to the [[Paektusan Rimch'\u014fl Line]] and the [[Samjiy\u014fn Line]].<ref>http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoHumanCultureDetail.aspx?mc=CC0501&sc=A33005001&tid=CC040100007874&direct=1&direct=1</ref> Also, the line connecting to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] from Rajin to Khasan is dual gauged for standard gauge and Russian gauge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=112&aid=0002232229|title=\ub77c\uc9c4-\ud558\uc0b0(\ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544) \ucca0\ub3c4, 10\uc6d4 \uc911\uc21c \uccab \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc6b4\ud589|publisher=news.naver.com}}</ref>\n\n====Sakhalin====\nIn the 20th century, railroads on the entire Sakhalin used the same {{RailGauge|3ft6in}} narrow gauge as Japan, as part of it was under Japan's control when railway construction began.  One stretch of rail that used {{RailGauge|600mm}} narrow gauge was converted to match the {{RailGauge|3ft6in}} narrow gauge after Russia took control of it.\n\nStarting from the 1970s, a train ferry service was provided to connect Sakhalin and the Russia mainland, requiring bogie exchange on wagons to allow operation on the Russian mainland {{RailGauge|1520mm}} broad gauge.\n\nIn 2003, the Russian government started to convert the entire network to dual gauge with {{RailGauge|3ft6in}} and {{RailGauge|1520mm}}. Work is 70% done as of 2016, and is expected to be complete by 2018. The entire island's rolling stock is expected to be replaced by {{RailGauge|1520mm}} rolling stock by 2020, thus eliminating the break of gauge between Sakhalin and the Russian mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-russia.ru/FarEast/news.asp?id=730322&sec=1671|title=\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 - \u0414\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 -  interfax-russia.ru|website=www.interfax-russia.ru}}</ref>\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n[[File:Taiwan Railways Route Map 201301.svg|thumb|Route of THSR shown in orange; all others are operated by TRA, Taiwan]]\n\nLike Japan, [[rail transport in Taiwan]] uses the {{RailGauge|3ft6in}} gauge for the majority of its railway network, but {{RailGauge|sg}} standard gauge for its high-speed rail; however, gauge differences are less of a problem as [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]] generally uses separate rolling stocks and its own discrete railway, and at most locations runs on routes kilometres away from the conventional [[Taiwan Railways Administration]] railway network.\n\n===Africa===\n* Rail lines linked by ferries on convenient rivers or lakes.

Edith's siblings were; Florence Mary (b. 1867), Mary Lilian (b. 1870) and John Frederick S. (1872\u20131923).{{sfn|Unger|1997}}\n\nShe was educated at [[Norwich High School for Girls]], then boarding schools in [[Clevedon]], Somerset and [[Peterborough]] (Laurel Court).{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAfter a period as a governess, including for a family in [[Brussels]] from 1890 to 1895, she returned home to care for her father during a serious illness. The experience led her to become a nurse after her father's recovery.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}} In April 1896, at the age of 30, Cavell applied to become a nurse probationer at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}} under Matron [[Eva Luckes]]. She worked in various hospitals in England, including [[St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney|Shoreditch Infirmary]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|p=8}} (since renamed St Leonard's Hospital). As a private travelling nurse, treating patients in their homes, Cavell travelled to tend patients with cancer, gout, pneumonia, pleurisy, eye issues and appendicitis.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}}\n\nCavell was sent to assist with the [[typhoid]] outbreak in [[Maidstone]] during 1897.  Along with other staff she was awarded the Maidstone Medal.{{sfn|Gazet|2015}}\n\nIn 1907, Cavell was recruited by Dr [[Antoine Depage]] to be [[matron]] of a newly established nursing school, L'\u00c9cole Belge d'Infirmi\u00e8res Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es (or the Berkendael Medical Institute) on the Rue de la Culture (now Rue Franz Merjay), in [[Ixelles]], Brussels.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} By 1910, \"Miss Cavell 'felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal' and, therefore, launched the nursing journal, ''L'infirmi\u00e8re''\".{{sfn|Judson|1941}} Within a year, she was training nurses for three hospitals, twenty-four schools, and thirteen kindergartens in Belgium.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, she was visiting her widowed mother in Norfolk. She returned to Brussels, where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the [[Red Cross]].\n\n== Return to Brussels ==\nCavell had been offered a position as matron in a Brussels clinic. She worked closely with Dr Depage who was part of a \"growing body of people\" in the medical profession in Belgium. He realised that the care that was being provided by the religious institutions had not been keeping up with medical advances. In 1910, Cavell was asked if she would be the matron for the new secular hospital at [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]].{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=3}}\n\n== First World War and execution ==\n\nIn November 1914, after the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation of Brussels]], Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. Wounded British and French soldiers as well as Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince R\u00e9ginald [[House of Cro\u00ff|de Cro\u00ff]] at his ch\u00e2teau of [[Bellignies]] near Mons. From there, they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell, Louis S\u00e9verin, and others in Brussels, where their hosts would furnish them with money to reach the Dutch frontier, and provide them with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} This placed Cavell in violation of [[German military law]].{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} German authorities became increasingly suspicious of the nurse's actions, which were further fuelled by her outspokenness.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}\n\nShe was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers. She had been betrayed by [[Georges Gaston Quien]], who was later convicted by a French court as a collaborator.{{sfn|The Mount Washington News|1934}}{{sfn|Palm Beach Daily News|1936}} She was held in Saint-Gilles prison for ten weeks, the last two of which were spent in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She made three depositions to the German police (on 8, 18 and 22 August), admitting that she had been instrumental in conveying about 60 British and 15 French soldiers, as well as about 100 French and Belgian civilians of military age, to the frontier and had sheltered most of them in her house.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nAt her [[court-martial]], she was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers, in addition to young Belgian men, to cross the Dutch border and eventually enter Britain. She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial. Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when they arrived safely in Britain. This admission confirmed that Cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier, but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} Her fellow defendants included Prince Reginald's sister, [[Princess Marie of Cro\u00ff]].\n\nThe penalty, according to German military law, was death. Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code determined that \"at time of war, anyone who with the intention of aiding a hostile power, or of causing harm to the German or allied troops\" commits any of the crimes defined in paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code \"shall be punished with death for war treason\". Specifically, Cavell was charged under paragraph 90 (1) no. 3 ''Reichsstrafgesetzbuch'', for \"conveying troops to the enemy\", a crime normally punishable by life imprisonment in peacetime.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} It was possible to charge Cavell with war treason as paragraph 160 of the German Military Code extended application of paragraph 58 to foreigners \"present in the zone of war\".\n[[File:C. 1916 Edith Cavell propaganda stamp.JPG|thumbnail|right|A [[cinderella stamp|propaganda stamp]] issued shortly after Cavell's death]]\nWhile the [[First Geneva Convention]] ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel, that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action. This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention, which was the version in force at the time,{{sfn|Bevans|1968|p=972}} and justified prosecution on the basis of German law.\n\nThe British government could do nothing to help her. Sir Horace Rowland of the [[Foreign Office]] said, \"I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell; I am afraid we are powerless.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised that, \"Any representation by us will do her more harm than good.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} The [[United States]], however, had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure. [[Hugh S. Gibson]], First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany's already damaged reputation. Later, he wrote:{{sfn|Gibson|1917}}\n\n{{Quote|We reminded [German civil governor Baron von der Lancken] of the burning of [[Leuven|Louvain]] and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', and told him that this murder would rank with those two affairs and would stir all civilised countries with horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see Miss Cavell shot than have harm come to the humblest German soldier, and his only regret was that they had not \"three or four old English women to shoot.\"}}\n\nBaron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives, German as well as Allied. However, [[Traugott von Sauberzweig|General von Sauberzweig]], the military governor of Brussels, ordered that \"in the interests of the State\" the implementation of the death penalty against Baucq and Cavell should be immediate,{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} denying higher authorities an opportunity to consider clemency.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} Cavell was defended by lawyer Sadi Kirschen from Brussels. Of the twenty-seven defendants, five were condemned to death: Cavell, Baucq (an architect in his thirties), [[Louise Thuliez]], S\u00e9verin and Countess Jeanne de Belleville. Of the five sentenced to death, only Cavell and Baucq were executed; the other three were granted reprieve.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nCavell was arrested not for espionage, as many were led to believe, but for \"war treason\", despite not being a German national.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She may have been recruited by the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted.{{sfn|Rankin|2008|p=36\u201337}} Rankin cites the published statement of [[M. R. D. Foot]], historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6.{{sfn|Watson|2014|}} The former director-general of MI5, [[Stella Rimington]], announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence gathering aspect to Cavell's network. The [[BBC Radio 4]] programme that presented Rimington's quote, noted Cavell's use of secret codes and, though amateurish, other network members' successful transmission of intelligence.{{sfn|Singh|2015}}\n\nWhen in custody, Cavell was questioned in French, but her trial was minuted in German; which some assert gave the prosecutor the opportunity to misinterpret her answers. Although she may have been misrepresented, she made no attempt to defend herself, but responded to have channelled \"''environ deux cents''\" soldiers to the Dutch border. Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor; a previous defender, who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant, Elizabeth Wilkins,{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} was ultimately rejected by the governor.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n[[File:Bellows, George Wesley, The Murder of Edith Cavell, 1918.jpg|thumb|[[George Bellows]], ''The Murder of Edith Cavell'', 1918, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe night before her execution, she told the Reverend Stirling Gahan, the Anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her [[Holy Communion]], \"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\"{{sfn|Gahan|1925|pp=288\u201389}} These words are inscribed on her statue on St Martin's Place (A400) <ref>https://www.bing.com/maps?q=london+st+martin-in-the-fields&form=EDNTHT&mkt=en-us&httpsmsn=1&refig=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&sp=3&qs=SC&pq=london+st+martin%27&sk=PRES1AS2&sc=8-17&cvid=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&cc=US&setlang=en-US</ref>, northeast of [[Trafalgar Square]] in London.  Her final words to the German [[Lutheran]] prison chaplain, Paul Le Seur, were recorded as, \"Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.\"{{sfn|Peterson|2018}}\n\nFrom his sick bed [[Brand Whitlock]], the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, wrote a personal note on Cavell's behalf to [[Moritz von Bissing]], the Governor-General of Belgium. Hugh Gibson; Maitre G. de Leval, the legal adviser to the United States legation; and {{ill|Rodrigo Saavedra y Vinent|es}}, 2nd Marques de Villalobar, the Spanish minister, formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of execution.{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1920}} Despite these efforts, on 11 October, Baron von der Lancken allowed the execution to proceed.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} Sixteen men, forming two firing squads, carried out the sentence pronounced on her and on four Belgian men at the [[Tir national]]{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} shooting range in [[Schaerbeek]], at 7:00{{nbsp}}am on 12 October 1915. There are conflicting reports of the details of Cavell's execution. However, according to the eyewitness account of the Reverend Le Seur, who attended Cavell in her final hours, eight soldiers fired at Cavell while the other eight executed Baucq.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Her execution, certification of death, and burial were all witnessed by the German poet [[Gottfried Benn]] in his capacity as a 'Senior Doctor in the Brussels Government since the first days of the (German) occupation'. Benn wrote a detailed account titled \"Wie Miss Cavell erschossen wurde\" (''How Miss Cavell was shot'', 1928).{{sfn|Benn|2013}}\n\nThere is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code. Supposedly, the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} The British post-war Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War however regarded the verdict as legally correct.{{sfn|Macdonell|1920|p=424}}\n\nOn instructions from the Spanish minister, Belgian women immediately buried her body next to Saint-Gilles Prison.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} After the war, her body was taken back to Britain for a memorial service at [[Westminster Abbey]] and then transferred to Norwich, to be laid to rest at Life's Green on the east side of the cathedral. The King had to grant an exception to an [[Order in Council]] of 1854, which prevented any burials in the grounds of the cathedral, to allow the reburial.{{sfn|Gazette|31332}}\n\n== First World War propaganda ==\n{{see also| British propaganda during World War I}}\n[[File:British Empire Union WWI poster.jpg|thumb|An anti-German post-First World War poster from the [[British Empire Union]], including Cavell's grave]]\n[[File:The Cavell Case.jpg|thumb|''The Cavell Case'' (1919), an American film]]\n[[File:Edith Cavell - Uccle.jpg|thumb|Edith Cavell ([[Uccle]] 2015), by Nathalie Lambert]]\nIn the months and years following Cavell's death, countless newspaper articles, pamphlets, images, and books publicised her story. She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain, and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States. She was a popular icon because of her sex, her nursing profession, and her apparently heroic approach to death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}}  Her execution was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity.\n\nNews reports shortly following Cavell's execution were found to be only true in part.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Even the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' repeated the fictional account of Cavell's execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Allegedly, while she lay unconscious, the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}  Along with the invasion of Belgium, and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', Cavell's execution was widely publicised in both Britain and North America by [[Wellington House]], the British War Propaganda Bureau.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBecause of the British government's decision to publicise Cavell's story as part of its propaganda effort, she became the most prominent British female casualty of the First World War.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell's case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBefore the First World War, Cavell was not well known outside nursing circles.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} This allowed two different depictions of the truth about her in British [[propaganda]], which were a reply to enemy attempts to justify her shooting, including the suggestion that Cavell, during her interrogation, had given information that incriminated others. In November 1915, the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony.\n\nOne image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} This view depicted her as having helped Allied soldiers to escape, but innocent of 'espionage', and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda, such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop forces that could arrange the judicial murder of an innocent British woman.\n\nAnother representation of a side of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious, reserved, brave, and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others. This portrayal has been illustrated in numerous biographical sources, from personal first-hand experiences of the Red Cross nurse. Pastor Le Seur, the German army chaplain, recalled at the time of her execution, \"I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a [[martyr]]{{nbsp}}... but she was ready to die for her country{{nbsp}}...  Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful [[Christians|Christian]]\".{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Another account from Anglican chaplain, the Reverend Gahan, remembers Cavell's words, \"I have no fear or shrinking; I have seen death so often it is not strange, or fearful to me!\"{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} In this interpretation, her stoicism was seen as remarkable for a non-combatant woman, and brought her even greater renown than a man in similar circumstances would have received.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n== German response ==\n\nThe Imperial German Government thought that it had acted fairly towards Cavell. In a letter, German Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Dr Alfred Zimmermann (not to be confused with [[Arthur Zimmermann]], German Secretary for Foreign Affairs) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government:\n\n{{quote|It was a pity that Miss Cavell had to be executed, but it was necessary. She was judged justly ... It is undoubtedly a terrible thing that the woman has been executed; but consider what would happen to a State, particularly in war, if it left crimes aimed at the safety of its armies to go unpunished because they were committed by women.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}}}}\nFrom the perspective of the German government, had it released Cavell there might have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished. It took the view that it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the world's condemnation. Its laws did not make distinctions between sexes; the only exception to this being that, according to legal customs, women in a \"delicate\" (probably this means \"pregnant\") condition should not be executed.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} However, in January 1916, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]] decreed that, from then, on capital punishment should not be carried out on women without his explicit prior endorsement.{{sfn|Hull|2014|pp=108\u201309}}\n\nThe German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts. The court paid particular attention to this point, releasing several people because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The condemned, in contrast, knew full well what they were doing and the punishment for committing their crimes because \"numerous public proclamations had pointed out the fact that aiding enemies\u2019 armies was punishable with death.\"{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The Allied response to this was the same as to [[Bethmann-Hollweg]]'s announcement of the invasion of Belgium, or the notice given in the papers of intent to sink such ships as the {{RMS|Lusitania}}; to make a public proclamation of a thing does not make it right.\n\n== Burial and memorials ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many of the list items are not cited-->\n[[File:Edith Cavell monument.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Cavell outside [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:XII Execution of Edith Cavell painting by Brian Whelan 2015.jpg|thumb|''XII \u2013 Execution of Edith Cavell'', one of 14 paintings on Cavell by [[Brian Whelan]] in [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Edith Cavel Memorial - statue.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble statue of Edith Cavell in nurse's uniform backed by a large granite column|Detail of the [[Edith Cavell Memorial]], St Martin's Place, London]]\n[[File:Schaerbeek Rue Colonel Bourg Enclos des fusill\u00e9s 02.jpg|thumb|War memorial in Rue Colonel Bourg, [[Schaerbeek]] including Cavell's name]]\n[[File:Monument Cavell-Depage Bxl.JPG|thumb|Monument to Edith Cavell and [[Marie Depage]], Brussels]]\n[[File:CavellVanQEIIJ60.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Cavell Van]] at [[Bodiam railway station]]]]\n\nCavell's remains were returned to Britain after the war.  As the ship bearing the coffin arrived in Dover, a full [[peal]] of [[Grandsire]] [[Method ringing#Method names|Triples]] (5040 Changes, Parker's Twelve-Part) was rung on the bells of the parish church.  The peal was notable: \"Rung with the bells deeply muffled with the exception of the Tenor which was open at back stroke, in token of respect to Nurse Cavell, whose body arrived at Dover during the ringing and rested in the town till the following morning.

On 19 May 1919, her body was reburied at the east side of [[Norwich Cathedral]]; a graveside service is still held each October.{{sfn|Norwich Cathedral}} The railway van known as the [[Cavell Van]] that conveyed her remains from Dover to London is kept as a memorial on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]] and is usually open to view at [[Bodiam railway station]].\n\nIn the Church of England's [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]], the day appointed for the commemoration of Cavell is 12 October. This is a memorial in her honour rather than formal [[canonisation]], and so not a \"saint's feast day\" in the traditional sense.\n\nFollowing Cavell's death, many memorials were created around the world to remember her. A patriotic song, \"Remember Nurse Cavell\" (words by Gordon V. Thompson, music by Jules Brazil) appeared with 1915 British copyright. The name [[Mount Edith Cavell]] was given in 1916 to a massive peak in Canada's Jasper National Park.  A memorial statue was unveiled on 12 October 1918 by [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] in the grounds of Norwich Cathedral, during the opening of a home for nurses, which also bore her name.{{sfn|The Times|1918}}\n\nTo commemorate her centenary in 2015, work went ahead to restore Cavell's grave in the grounds of Norwich Cathedral after being awarded a \u00a350,000 grant.{{sfn|BBC News|2014b}} Fourteen paintings by [[Brian Whelan]] were commissioned by [[Norwich Cathedral]] to commemorate the life and death of Edith Cavell.{{sfn|Whelan|2015|p=12}}\n\nDuring October 2015, a railway carriage (Cavell Van) used to transport Cavell's body back to the United Kingdom was on display outside the [[The Forum, Norwich|Forum]], Norwich.{{sfn|BBC News|2015}} [[Norwich Cathedral]] held a memorial service, performed live on BBC Radio 4 on 11 October 2015.

She is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers from both sides without discrimination and in helping some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium during the [[World War I|First World War]], for which she was arrested. She was accused of [[treason]], found guilty by a [[court-martial]] and sentenced to death.  Despite international pressure for mercy, she was shot by a German firing squad. Her execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage.\n\nThe night before her execution, she said, \"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\" These words were later inscribed on a memorial to her near [[Trafalgar Square]]. Her strong [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] beliefs propelled her to help all those who needed it, both German and Allied soldiers. She was quoted as saying, \"I can\u2019t stop while there are lives to be saved.\"{{sfn|Judson|1941}} The [[Church of England]] commemorates her in its Calendar of Saints on 12 October.\n\nCavell, who was 49 at the time of her execution, was already notable as a pioneer of modern nursing in Belgium.\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\n[[File:Nurse Edith Cavell 1865-1915 Q32930.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cavell in a garden in Brussels with her two dogs before the outbreak of war]]\n[[File:Nurse Edith Cavell 1865-1915; Brussels Q70204.jpg|thumb|Cavell (seated centre) with a group of multinational student nurses whom she trained in Brussels]]\nCavell was born on 4 December 1865{{sfn|Unger|1997}} in [[Swardeston]], a village near [[Norwich]], where her father was vicar for 45 years.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She was the eldest of the four children of the Reverend Frederick Cavell (1824\u20131910) and his wife Louisa Sophia Warming (1835\u20131918). Edith's siblings were; Florence Mary (b. 1867), Mary Lilian (b. 1870) and John Frederick S. (1872\u20131923).{{sfn|Unger|1997}}\n\nShe was educated at [[Norwich High School for Girls]], then boarding schools in [[Clevedon]], Somerset and [[Peterborough]] (Laurel Court).{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAfter a period as a governess, including for a family in [[Brussels]] from 1890 to 1895, she returned home to care for her father during a serious illness. The experience led her to become a nurse after her father's recovery.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}} In April 1896, at the age of 30, Cavell applied to become a nurse probationer at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}} under Matron [[Eva Luckes]]. She worked in various hospitals in England, including [[St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney|Shoreditch Infirmary]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|p=8}} (since renamed St Leonard's Hospital). As a private travelling nurse, treating patients in their homes, Cavell travelled to tend patients with cancer, gout, pneumonia, pleurisy, eye issues and appendicitis.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}}\n\nCavell was sent to assist with the [[typhoid]] outbreak in [[Maidstone]] during 1897.  Along with other staff she was awarded the Maidstone Medal.{{sfn|Gazet|2015}}\n\nIn 1907, Cavell was recruited by Dr [[Antoine Depage]] to be [[matron]] of a newly established nursing school, L'\u00c9cole Belge d'Infirmi\u00e8res Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es (or the Berkendael Medical Institute) on the Rue de la Culture (now Rue Franz Merjay), in [[Ixelles]], Brussels.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} By 1910, \"Miss Cavell 'felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal' and, therefore, launched the nursing journal, ''L'infirmi\u00e8re''\".{{sfn|Judson|1941}} Within a year, she was training nurses for three hospitals, twenty-four schools, and thirteen kindergartens in Belgium.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, she was visiting her widowed mother in Norfolk. She returned to Brussels, where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the [[Red Cross]].\n\n== Return to Brussels ==\nCavell had been offered a position as matron in a Brussels clinic. She worked closely with Dr Depage who was part of a \"growing body of people\" in the medical profession in Belgium. He realised that the care that was being provided by the religious institutions had not been keeping up with medical advances. In 1910, Cavell was asked if she would be the matron for the new secular hospital at [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]].{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=3}}\n\n== First World War and execution ==\n\nIn November 1914, after the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation of Brussels]], Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. Wounded British and French soldiers as well as Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince R\u00e9ginald [[House of Cro\u00ff|de Cro\u00ff]] at his ch\u00e2teau of [[Bellignies]] near Mons. From there, they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell, Louis S\u00e9verin, and others in Brussels, where their hosts would furnish them with money to reach the Dutch frontier, and provide them with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} This placed Cavell in violation of [[German military law]].{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} German authorities became increasingly suspicious of the nurse's actions, which were further fuelled by her outspokenness.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}\n\nShe was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers. She had been betrayed by [[Georges Gaston Quien]], who was later convicted by a French court as a collaborator.{{sfn|The Mount Washington News|1934}}{{sfn|Palm Beach Daily News|1936}} She was held in Saint-Gilles prison for ten weeks, the last two of which were spent in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She made three depositions to the German police (on 8, 18 and 22 August), admitting that she had been instrumental in conveying about 60 British and 15 French soldiers, as well as about 100 French and Belgian civilians of military age, to the frontier and had sheltered most of them in her house.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nAt her [[court-martial]], she was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers, in addition to young Belgian men, to cross the Dutch border and eventually enter Britain. She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial. Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when they arrived safely in Britain. This admission confirmed that Cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier, but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} Her fellow defendants included Prince Reginald's sister, [[Princess Marie of Cro\u00ff]].\n\nThe penalty, according to German military law, was death. Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code determined that \"at time of war, anyone who with the intention of aiding a hostile power, or of causing harm to the German or allied troops\" commits any of the crimes defined in paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code \"shall be punished with death for war treason\". Specifically, Cavell was charged under paragraph 90 (1) no. 3 ''Reichsstrafgesetzbuch'', for \"conveying troops to the enemy\", a crime normally punishable by life imprisonment in peacetime.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} It was possible to charge Cavell with war treason as paragraph 160 of the German Military Code extended application of paragraph 58 to foreigners \"present in the zone of war\".\n[[File:C. 1916 Edith Cavell propaganda stamp.JPG|thumbnail|right|A [[cinderella stamp|propaganda stamp]] issued shortly after Cavell's death]]\nWhile the [[First Geneva Convention]] ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel, that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action. This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention, which was the version in force at the time,{{sfn|Bevans|1968|p=972}} and justified prosecution on the basis of German law.\n\nThe British government could do nothing to help her. Sir Horace Rowland of the [[Foreign Office]] said, \"I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell; I am afraid we are powerless.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised that, \"Any representation by us will do her more harm than good.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} The [[United States]], however, had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure. [[Hugh S. Gibson]], First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany's already damaged reputation. Later, he wrote:{{sfn|Gibson|1917}}\n\n{{Quote|We reminded [German civil governor Baron von der Lancken] of the burning of [[Leuven|Louvain]] and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', and told him that this murder would rank with those two affairs and would stir all civilised countries with horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see Miss Cavell shot than have harm come to the humblest German soldier, and his only regret was that they had not \"three or four old English women to shoot.\"}}\n\nBaron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives, German as well as Allied. However, [[Traugott von Sauberzweig|General von Sauberzweig]], the military governor of Brussels, ordered that \"in the interests of the State\" the implementation of the death penalty against Baucq and Cavell should be immediate,{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} denying higher authorities an opportunity to consider clemency.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} Cavell was defended by lawyer Sadi Kirschen from Brussels. Of the twenty-seven defendants, five were condemned to death: Cavell, Baucq (an architect in his thirties), [[Louise Thuliez]], S\u00e9verin and Countess Jeanne de Belleville. Of the five sentenced to death, only Cavell and Baucq were executed; the other three were granted reprieve.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nCavell was arrested not for espionage, as many were led to believe, but for \"war treason\", despite not being a German national.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She may have been recruited by the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted.{{sfn|Rankin|2008|p=36\u201337}} Rankin cites the published statement of [[M. R. D. Foot]], historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6.{{sfn|Watson|2014|}} The former director-general of MI5, [[Stella Rimington]], announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence gathering aspect to Cavell's network. The [[BBC Radio 4]] programme that presented Rimington's quote, noted Cavell's use of secret codes and, though amateurish, other network members' successful transmission of intelligence.{{sfn|Singh|2015}}\n\nWhen in custody, Cavell was questioned in French, but her trial was minuted in German; which some assert gave the prosecutor the opportunity to misinterpret her answers. Although she may have been misrepresented, she made no attempt to defend herself, but responded to have channelled \"''environ deux cents''\" soldiers to the Dutch border. Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor; a previous defender, who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant, Elizabeth Wilkins,{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} was ultimately rejected by the governor.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n[[File:Bellows, George Wesley, The Murder of Edith Cavell, 1918.jpg|thumb|[[George Bellows]], ''The Murder of Edith Cavell'', 1918, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe night before her execution, she told the Reverend Stirling Gahan, the Anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her [[Holy Communion]], \"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\"{{sfn|Gahan|1925|pp=288\u201389}} These words are inscribed on her statue on St Martin's Place (A400) <ref>https://www.bing.com/maps?q=london+st+martin-in-the-fields&form=EDNTHT&mkt=en-us&httpsmsn=1&refig=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&sp=3&qs=SC&pq=london+st+martin%27&sk=PRES1AS2&sc=8-17&cvid=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&cc=US&setlang=en-US</ref>, northeast of [[Trafalgar Square]] in London.  Her final words to the German [[Lutheran]] prison chaplain, Paul Le Seur, were recorded as, \"Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.\"{{sfn|Peterson|2018}}\n\nFrom his sick bed [[Brand Whitlock]], the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, wrote a personal note on Cavell's behalf to [[Moritz von Bissing]], the Governor-General of Belgium. Hugh Gibson; Maitre G. de Leval, the legal adviser to the United States legation; and {{ill|Rodrigo Saavedra y Vinent|es}}, 2nd Marques de Villalobar, the Spanish minister, formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of execution.{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1920}} Despite these efforts, on 11 October, Baron von der Lancken allowed the execution to proceed.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} Sixteen men, forming two firing squads, carried out the sentence pronounced on her and on four Belgian men at the [[Tir national]]{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} shooting range in [[Schaerbeek]], at 7:00{{nbsp}}am on 12 October 1915. There are conflicting reports of the details of Cavell's execution. However, according to the eyewitness account of the Reverend Le Seur, who attended Cavell in her final hours, eight soldiers fired at Cavell while the other eight executed Baucq.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Her execution, certification of death, and burial were all witnessed by the German poet [[Gottfried Benn]] in his capacity as a 'Senior Doctor in the Brussels Government since the first days of the (German) occupation'. Benn wrote a detailed account titled \"Wie Miss Cavell erschossen wurde\" (''How Miss Cavell was shot'', 1928).{{sfn|Benn|2013}}\n\nThere is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code. Supposedly, the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} The British post-war Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War however regarded the verdict as legally correct.{{sfn|Macdonell|1920|p=424}}\n\nOn instructions from the Spanish minister, Belgian women immediately buried her body next to Saint-Gilles Prison.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} After the war, her body was taken back to Britain for a memorial service at [[Westminster Abbey]] and then transferred to Norwich, to be laid to rest at Life's Green on the east side of the cathedral. The King had to grant an exception to an [[Order in Council]] of 1854, which prevented any burials in the grounds of the cathedral, to allow the reburial.{{sfn|Gazette|31332}}\n\n== First World War propaganda ==\n{{see also| British propaganda during World War I}}\n[[File:British Empire Union WWI poster.jpg|thumb|An anti-German post-First World War poster from the [[British Empire Union]], including Cavell's grave]]\n[[File:The Cavell Case.jpg|thumb|''The Cavell Case'' (1919), an American film]]\n[[File:Edith Cavell - Uccle.jpg|thumb|Edith Cavell ([[Uccle]] 2015), by Nathalie Lambert]]\nIn the months and years following Cavell's death, countless newspaper articles, pamphlets, images, and books publicised her story. She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain, and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States. She was a popular icon because of her sex, her nursing profession, and her apparently heroic approach to death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}}  Her execution was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity.\n\nNews reports shortly following Cavell's execution were found to be only true in part.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Even the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' repeated the fictional account of Cavell's execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Allegedly, while she lay unconscious, the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}  Along with the invasion of Belgium, and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', Cavell's execution was widely publicised in both Britain and North America by [[Wellington House]], the British War Propaganda Bureau.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBecause of the British government's decision to publicise Cavell's story as part of its propaganda effort, she became the most prominent British female casualty of the First World War.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell's case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBefore the First World War, Cavell was not well known outside nursing circles.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} This allowed two different depictions of the truth about her in British [[propaganda]], which were a reply to enemy attempts to justify her shooting, including the suggestion that Cavell, during her interrogation, had given information that incriminated others. In November 1915, the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony.\n\nOne image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} This view depicted her as having helped Allied soldiers to escape, but innocent of 'espionage', and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda, such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop forces that could arrange the judicial murder of an innocent British woman.\n\nAnother representation of a side of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious, reserved, brave, and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others. This portrayal has been illustrated in numerous biographical sources, from personal first-hand experiences of the Red Cross nurse. Pastor Le Seur, the German army chaplain, recalled at the time of her execution, \"I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a [[martyr]]{{nbsp}}... but she was ready to die for her country{{nbsp}}...  Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful [[Christians|Christian]]\".{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Another account from Anglican chaplain, the Reverend Gahan, remembers Cavell's words, \"I have no fear or shrinking; I have seen death so often it is not strange, or fearful to me!\"{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} In this interpretation, her stoicism was seen as remarkable for a non-combatant woman, and brought her even greater renown than a man in similar circumstances would have received.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n== German response ==\n\nThe Imperial German Government thought that it had acted fairly towards Cavell. In a letter, German Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Dr Alfred Zimmermann (not to be confused with [[Arthur Zimmermann]], German Secretary for Foreign Affairs) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government:\n\n{{quote|It was a pity that Miss Cavell had to be executed, but it was necessary. She was judged justly ... It is undoubtedly a terrible thing that the woman has been executed; but consider what would happen to a State, particularly in war, if it left crimes aimed at the safety of its armies to go unpunished because they were committed by women.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}}}}\nFrom the perspective of the German government, had it released Cavell there might have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished. It took the view that it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the world's condemnation. Its laws did not make distinctions between sexes; the only exception to this being that, according to legal customs, women in a \"delicate\" (probably this means \"pregnant\") condition should not be executed.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} However, in January 1916, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]] decreed that, from then, on capital punishment should not be carried out on women without his explicit prior endorsement.{{sfn|Hull|2014|pp=108\u201309}}\n\nThe German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts. The court paid particular attention to this point, releasing several people because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The condemned, in contrast, knew full well what they were doing and the punishment for committing their crimes because \"numerous public proclamations had pointed out the fact that aiding enemies\u2019 armies was punishable with death.\"{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The Allied response to this was the same as to [[Bethmann-Hollweg]]'s announcement of the invasion of Belgium, or the notice given in the papers of intent to sink such ships as the {{RMS|Lusitania}}; to make a public proclamation of a thing does not make it right.\n\n== Burial and memorials ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many of the list items are not cited-->\n[[File:Edith Cavell monument.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Cavell outside [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:XII Execution of Edith Cavell painting by Brian Whelan 2015.jpg|thumb|''XII \u2013 Execution of Edith Cavell'', one of 14 paintings on Cavell by [[Brian Whelan]] in [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Edith Cavel Memorial - statue.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble statue of Edith Cavell in nurse's uniform backed by a large granite column|Detail of the [[Edith Cavell Memorial]], St Martin's Place, London]]\n[[File:Schaerbeek Rue Colonel Bourg Enclos des fusill\u00e9s 02.jpg|thumb|War memorial in Rue Colonel Bourg, [[Schaerbeek]] including Cavell's name]]\n[[File:Monument Cavell-Depage Bxl.JPG|thumb|Monument to Edith Cavell and [[Marie Depage]], Brussels]]\n[[File:CavellVanQEIIJ60.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Cavell Van]] at [[Bodiam railway station]]]]\n\nCavell's remains were returned to Britain after the war.  As the ship bearing the coffin arrived in Dover, a full [[peal]] of [[Grandsire]] [[Method ringing#Method names|Triples]] (5040 Changes, Parker's Twelve-Part) was rung on the bells of the parish church.  The peal was notable: \"Rung with the bells deeply muffled with the exception of the Tenor which was open at back stroke, in token of respect to Nurse Cavell, whose body arrived at Dover during the ringing and rested in the town till the following morning. The ringers of 1-2-3-4-5-6 are ex-soldiers, F. Elliot having been eight months Prisoner of War in Germany.\"  Deep (or full) muffling is normally only used for the deaths of sovereigns.{{sfn|KCACR}}  A peal using the same method, with the bells half muffled, was rung for the centenary of her repatriation.{{sfn|Baldock|2019}}  After an overnight pause in the parish church the body was conveyed to London and a [[state funeral]] was held at [[Westminster Abbey]]. On 19 May 1919, her body was reburied at the east side of [[Norwich Cathedral]]; a graveside service is still held each October.{{sfn|Norwich Cathedral}} The railway van known as the [[Cavell Van]] that conveyed her remains from Dover to London is kept as a memorial on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]] and is usually open to view at [[Bodiam railway station]].\n\nIn the Church of England's [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]], the day appointed for the commemoration of Cavell is 12 October. This is a memorial in her honour rather than formal [[canonisation]], and so not a \"saint's feast day\" in the traditional sense.\n\nFollowing Cavell's death, many memorials were created around the world to remember her.
