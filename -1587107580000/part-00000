In 1921 it became the subject of the first Soviet Georgian historical film, directed by [[Ivan Perestiani]], \"The Murder of General Gryaznov\".\n\n=== Sir Frank Renouf ===\nHer first marriage ended in a 1990 divorce, and in 1991 she married New Zealander Sir [[Francis Renouf]], a merchant banker and former POW in a German camp, who had worked alongside [[Hermann Abs]] of the [[Deutsche Bank]] to reconstruct Germany's postwar banking system.<ref name=\"RenAut\">''Sir Francis Renouf: an autobiography'' (1997, Steele Roberts, Wellington) {{ISBN|0-9583712-0-2}}</ref> At the time of the wedding, Sir Francis was seventy-two years old and his wife forty-four years of age.\n\nAsked by the press about his reaction to marrying a Countess, Sir Francis told society columnist [[Nigel Dempster]]: \"... obviously it's a Russian title, but she's called Lady Renouf now so it doesn't matter.\"<ref name=\"Dempster1\">''Renouf's new Lady'', [[Nigel Dempster]], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 17 January 1991.</ref> Their matrimonial home in [[Eaton Square]], Belgravia, was the former home of [[Neville Chamberlain]], the British Prime Minister from May 1937 to May 1940. Sir Francis was the focus of media interest after losing a substantial part of his fortune and investors' money in the [[Crash of 1987|1987 stockmarket crash]] and undergoing a dramatic divorce from his [[Susan Renouf|second wife]] in Sydney. The new Lady Renouf found herself the subject of their reporting, as there was already a considerable tabloid media circus surrounding Sir Francis's second wife. They interviewed her long estranged and terminally ill father Arthur Mainwaring, who was a [[Korean War]] reconnaissance [[Aerial photography|aerial photographer]] and continued this role for the local [[Port Macquarie]] News. Arthur Mainwaring, whose parents owned a hotel by the ocean at The Entrance, had also been a part-time courier driver to aid local businesses when travelling between his coastal home and his city studio 100 miles away (allowing the press to have further fun at Sir Francis's expense by portraying his new wife as the daughter of a truck driver). According to ''The Age'', the marriage dissolved after a few months following articles which portrayed Lady Renouf as from humble origins in Australia:\n\n<blockquote>Their union collapsed in 1991 after only a few months, when Sir Frank reportedly discovered the then Countess Griaznoff was a truckie's daughter from The Entrance, on the NSW central coast and not a Russian noblewoman. He later described the marriage as a \"nasty accident.\"<ref name=\"TheAge1\"/></blockquote>\n\nSir Francis and Lady Renouf parted company shortly after the media ridicule surrounding their marriage, which formally ended in divorce five years later, despite his attempts at reconciliation. He suffered a heart attack and stroke soon after the divorce was finalised.{{fact?|date=June 2017}}\n\nDuring the fallout from her marriage to Sir Francis she had claimed her father was deceased,<ref name=\"smh\"/> with the occupation of hotelier,<ref name=\"Australian\"/> on her marriage certificate.<ref name=\"Sproull\">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20943861-2702,00.html</ref> According to ''The Australian'', her father, a \"retired courier driver and photographer for the Port Macquarie News said he had never owned a hotel.\" Renouf believed her long-estranged and terminally ill father was dead at the time of her second marriage, and put hotelier on the certificate because among many other occupations he had been part of the family business, a long established hotel at [[The Entrance, New South Wales|The Entrance]].<ref name=\"Australian\"/> For many years his main occupation was as an aerial photographer, and while travelling between The Entrance and his studio in [[Sydney]] he assisted friends and local businesses, acting as a courier for packages.\n\n==Globe Theatre Advisory Board==\nDuring her honeymoon in New Zealand in the early 1990s, Renouf had been invited to add stitches to a giant New Zealand wool tapestry curtain which was its national contribution to the Globe Theatre reconstruction project. This led to her joining the Globe's advisory board on her return to London and raising funds for the completion. Renouf and her associates sponsored the building of the Globe's Wardrobe of Robes Room. Her design for an [[Elizabethan]] [[knot garden|Knot and Maze Garden]] for the reconstruction of [[William Shakespeare]]\u2019s [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] outside the Globe was blocked by the Provost of [[Southwark Cathedral]], [[Colin Slee]], who objected to the possibility that his windows might be overlooked by members of the public.<ref name=\"Derwent\"/>\n\n==Activism==\nAfter providing legal support to Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], Renouf explained to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in March 2009, \"our concern is not Holocaust denial, but debate denial. People should have the freedom to question the accepted view of what happened. That questioning is part of our culture.\"<ref name=\"Harrison\"/>\n\nShe has said her interest began when a Jewish member of a committee which she had convened objected to [[suckling pig]] being an option on the menu at a dinner she was organising in 1997 for the [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe]] restoration. ''[[The Australian]]'' traced the woman, a \"retired American art gallery owner named Wylma Wayne\", who denied Renouf's recollections and insisted that her objections had not been related to [[kosher]] issues.<ref name=\"Australian\"/>\n\n==Palestine==\nIn January 2001 Lady Renouf had an announcement published in the Personal Column of ''[[The Times]]'': \"On 'Holocaust' Day remember their 3.5 million Palestinian refugees.\"<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 January 2001, p 25.</ref> This elicited correspondence from Eric Lowe, a British veteran of the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|1945-48 war against Zionist terrorism]] and editor of ''Palestine Scrapbook''.

Penguin Books and Lipstadt|Irving's libel case]] against the historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]], she first became interested in the use of the term [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|Holocaust]] in relation to World War II history, having had no special interest in or knowledge of the period previously.\n\nShe attended the two-month libel action Irving brought against Lipstadt and expressed interest in Irving's ideas and the reaction to them. \"I found on Irving's side of the courtroom a solitary person representing himself, backed up by enormous forensic research and tremendously capable debate based on substance and fact... On the other side of the courtroom I saw 21-25 people with laptops connected it seems to the [[Israel]]i government.

Sir Francis was the focus of media interest after losing a substantial part of his fortune and investors' money in the [[Crash of 1987|1987 stockmarket crash]] and undergoing a dramatic divorce from his [[Susan Renouf|second wife]] in Sydney. The new Lady Renouf found herself the subject of their reporting, as there was already a considerable tabloid media circus surrounding Sir Francis's second wife. They interviewed her long estranged and terminally ill father Arthur Mainwaring, who was a [[Korean War]] reconnaissance [[Aerial photography|aerial photographer]] and continued this role for the local [[Port Macquarie]] News. Arthur Mainwaring, whose parents owned a hotel by the ocean at The Entrance, had also been a part-time courier driver to aid local businesses when travelling between his coastal home and his city studio 100 miles away (allowing the press to have further fun at Sir Francis's expense by portraying his new wife as the daughter of a truck driver). According to ''The Age'', the marriage dissolved after a few months following articles which portrayed Lady Renouf as from humble origins in Australia:\n\n<blockquote>Their union collapsed in 1991 after only a few months, when Sir Frank reportedly discovered the then Countess Griaznoff was a truckie's daughter from The Entrance, on the NSW central coast and not a Russian noblewoman. He later described the marriage as a \"nasty accident.\"<ref name=\"TheAge1\"/></blockquote>\n\nSir Francis and Lady Renouf parted company shortly after the media ridicule surrounding their marriage, which formally ended in divorce five years later, despite his attempts at reconciliation. He suffered a heart attack and stroke soon after the divorce was finalised.{{fact?|date=June 2017}}\n\nDuring the fallout from her marriage to Sir Francis she had claimed her father was deceased,<ref name=\"smh\"/> with the occupation of hotelier,<ref name=\"Australian\"/> on her marriage certificate.<ref name=\"Sproull\">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20943861-2702,00.html</ref> According to ''The Australian'', her father, a \"retired courier driver and photographer for the Port Macquarie News said he had never owned a hotel.\" Renouf believed her long-estranged and terminally ill father was dead at the time of her second marriage, and put hotelier on the certificate because among many other occupations he had been part of the family business, a long established hotel at [[The Entrance, New South Wales|The Entrance]].<ref name=\"Australian\"/> For many years his main occupation was as an aerial photographer, and while travelling between The Entrance and his studio in [[Sydney]] he assisted friends and local businesses, acting as a courier for packages.\n\n==Globe Theatre Advisory Board==\nDuring her honeymoon in New Zealand in the early 1990s, Renouf had been invited to add stitches to a giant New Zealand wool tapestry curtain which was its national contribution to the Globe Theatre reconstruction project. This led to her joining the Globe's advisory board on her return to London and raising funds for the completion. Renouf and her associates sponsored the building of the Globe's Wardrobe of Robes Room. Her design for an [[Elizabethan]] [[knot garden|Knot and Maze Garden]] for the reconstruction of [[William Shakespeare]]\u2019s [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] outside the Globe was blocked by the Provost of [[Southwark Cathedral]], [[Colin Slee]], who objected to the possibility that his windows might be overlooked by members of the public.<ref name=\"Derwent\"/>\n\n==Activism==\nAfter providing legal support to Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], Renouf explained to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in March 2009, \"our concern is not Holocaust denial, but debate denial. People should have the freedom to question the accepted view of what happened. That questioning is part of our culture.\"<ref name=\"Harrison\"/>\n\nShe has said her interest began when a Jewish member of a committee which she had convened objected to [[suckling pig]] being an option on the menu at a dinner she was organising in 1997 for the [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe]] restoration. ''[[The Australian]]'' traced the woman, a \"retired American art gallery owner named Wylma Wayne\", who denied Renouf's recollections and insisted that her objections had not been related to [[kosher]] issues.<ref name=\"Australian\"/>\n\n==Palestine==\nIn January 2001 Lady Renouf had an announcement published in the Personal Column of ''[[The Times]]'': \"On 'Holocaust' Day remember their 3.5 million Palestinian refugees.\"<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 January 2001, p 25.</ref> This elicited correspondence from Eric Lowe, a British veteran of the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|1945-48 war against Zionist terrorism]] and editor of ''Palestine Scrapbook''.

Penguin Books and Lipstadt|Irving's libel case]] against the historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]], she first became interested in the use of the term [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|Holocaust]] in relation to World War II history, having had no special interest in or knowledge of the period previously.\n\nShe attended the two-month libel action Irving brought against Lipstadt and expressed interest in Irving's ideas and the reaction to them. \"I found on Irving's side of the courtroom a solitary person representing himself, backed up by enormous forensic research and tremendously capable debate based on substance and fact...

The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.
