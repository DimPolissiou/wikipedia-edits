Public reaction was so enthusiastic that chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was directed to develop it as a standard [[production vehicle]].\n\nSjoberg selected 85 engineers to be \"Team Viper\", with development beginning in March 1989. The team asked the then-Chrysler subsidiary [[Lamborghini]] to cast a prototype aluminum block for the sports car to use in May. The production body was completed in fall 1989, with a [[chassis]] prototype running in December. Though a [[V8 engine]] was first used in the [[Development mule|test mule]], the V10 engine, which the production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990. Official approval from Chrysler chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] came in May 1990. One year later, [[Carroll Shelby]] piloted a [[pre-production car]] as the [[Safety car|pace vehicle]] in the [[Indianapolis 500]] race. In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with the first [[retail]] shipments beginning in January 1992.\n\n== {{anchor|SR}} Models ==\n=== {{anchor|first}} First generation (SR I; 1991&ndash;1995) ===\n{{Main|Dodge Viper (SR I)}}{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = DODGE Viper Gen 1.JPG\n| image2 = Dodge Viper RT-10 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (13).jpg\n| image3 = 1992 Dodge Viper engine.JPG\n| caption3 = Dodge Viper (SR I).\n}}\nThe first prototype was tested in January 1989. It debuted in 1991 with two [[Pre-production car|pre-production models]] as the [[Safety car|pace car]] for the [[Indianapolis 500]] when Dodge was forced to substitute it in place of the Japanese-built [[Dodge Stealth]] because of complaints from the [[United Auto Workers]], and went on sale in January 1992 as the ''RT/10 [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]''.\n\n[[Lamborghini]] (then owned by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]]) helped with the design of the [[V10 engine]] for the Viper, which was based on the [[Chrysler LA engine|Chrysler's LA]] [[V8 engine]]. A major contributor to the Viper since the beginning was Dick Winkles, the chief power engineer, who had spent time in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dRqgSuHAjgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA296#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Car: The Definitive Visual History of the Automobile|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780756689384|page=296|language=en|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOriginally engineered to be a performance car, the Viper contained no exterior-mounted door handles or key cylinders and no [[air conditioning]] (however, this was added as an option in later models, and [[climate control]]s featured a \"snowflake\" icon, which indicated a potential setting for the A/C). The roof was made from [[canvas]], and the windows were made from vinyl and used zippers to open and close, much like the [[Jeep Wrangler (YJ)|Jeep Wrangler]]. However, the Viper was still equipped with some domestic features, including manually-adjustable sport leather-trimmed [[bucket seat]]s with lumbar support, an [[Vehicle audio|AM-FM stereo cassette player]] with clock and [[high fidelity]] sound system, and interior carpeting. Aluminium [[alloy wheels]] were larger in diameter due to the larger [[brake]]s. A lightweight [[fiberglass]] [[Hardtop|hard roof]] option on later models was also available to cover the canvas soft roof, and was shipped with each new car. There were also no [[airbags]], in the interest of weight reduction. Adjustable performance [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was also an available option for most Vipers.\n\nThe engine weighs {{convert|711|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and generates a maximum power output of {{convert|400|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|465|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&nbsp;rpm, and due to the long-gearing allowed by the engine, provides fuel economy at a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]-rated {{convert|12|mpgus|abbr=on}} in the city and {{convert|20|mpgus|abbr=on}} on the highway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008f.jsp?hiddenField=Manufacturer&year=1994&make=Dodge |title=Vehicle Table |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date=September 10, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103053726/http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008f.jsp?hiddenField=Manufacturer&year=1994&make=Dodge |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref> The body is a tubular [[steel]] frame with resin [[transfer molding]] (RTM) [[fiberglass]] panels.

The [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] relocated the exposed side [[exhaust pipe]]s to a single [[muffler]] at the rear exiting via two large central [[tailpipe]]s during the middle of the model year, which reduced back pressure, and therefore increased the power to {{convert|415|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. [[Torque]] would also increase by {{convert|23|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|488|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A removable [[hardtop]] was now available along with a sliding glass window.

In 1997, the RT/10 would receive a power increase to 450&nbsp;hp along with air-bags and power windows. In 1998, both of the versions of the Viper were equipped with second-generation air bags, revised [[exhaust manifold]]s (saving {{convert|24|lb|0|abbr=on}} over the previous cast iron components) along with a revised [[camshaft]].\n\nIn 1998, the GT2 Commemorative Edition was released. With the FIA GT2 Team and Driver series wins in October 1997, Team Viper set forth with the creation of a unique Viper called the GT2 Commemorative Edition. There would be 100 offered through the top Dodge Viper dealers.\n\nThe team started working on the concept in November 1997 with design concept approve in January 1998, prototype parts in February 1998, pricing approval of $85,200 in April 1998, and production from June 16 to July 7, 1998. The vehicles were the first to be built in VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) sequential order with the first having 001 as its last three on the VIN and the last being 100.\n\nThe GT2 exterior is best known for its white with blue stripes paint, large rear wing, front dive planes and splitter, side sills, American flag, BBS rims, and GTS-R badging. Its this badging that causes many to refer to the vehicle as the GTS-R. However, the GTS-R was the race version of the Viper and not street legal.\n\nThe GT2 interior is best known for the blue accent trim, Oreca 5-point racing harness, and the center dash plaque with the vehicles unique production number.\n\nThe GT2 power increased by 10 horsepower to 460 HP with the use of K&N air filter and smooth tubes connecting the filter to the intake manifold. Torque increased by 10 to 500 foot pounds.\n\nOf the 100 number vehicles, number 100 was kept by the Chrysler museum until it was later sold into private ownership. Number 051 was given to Oreca Team driver Olivier Beretta. However, due to Monaco's import regulations, Olivier was unable to take delivery. The vehicle was later sold at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale's auction and is in private hands. Number 052 was given to Oreca Team driver Justin Bell. He kept the vehicle for several years before being sold into private hands.\n\nThe GT2 is regarded as the pinnacle of the Gen II (Generation Two) GTS Viper coupe collectability.\n\nAny reference to the GT2 being built to meet any homologation effort are inaccurate.\n\nIn 1999, ACR performance package was released.  With the increase of Viper owner's \"tracking\" their vehicles, Team Viper created a track ready version of the GTS.\n\nThe ACR used the same K&N air filter and smooth tubes from the GT2 for the power gains along with the BBS rims.  A new 5-point harness with the ACR logo was installed for both the driver and passenger.  For 1999, Koni adjustable shocks were installed and changed to Dynamics later in the 2000 model year.  Lastly, the spring rates were increased.  The vehicle could be painted in solid color or with stripes with the color choices changing yearly.  The ACR came standard with air conditioning and radio deleted, but could be added back in as a $10,000 option.  A small amount were produced yearly that were AC and radio delete.\n\nIn 2000, the Dodge Viper was updated to lighter [[hypereutectic]] [[piston]]s and received factory frame improvements. While the hypereutectic pistons provided less expansion, the [[forged]] pistons were preferred by customers for the [[supercharged]] and [[turbocharged]] aftermarket packages. TSB ([[Technical Service Bulletin]]) recalls (998 and 999) were done at local dealerships to repair the 1996 to 1999 Viper frames by adding gussets with rivets near the steering box. 2001 saw the addition of [[Anti-lock braking system]].\n\n2002 would be the final year of the second generation of the Viper. Dodge would build 360 \u201cFinal Edition\u201d cars (326 coup\u00e9s and 34 ACR editions)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/06/dodge-slithers-out-new-2010-viper-final-edition/|title=Dodge slithers out new 2010 Viper Final Edition models|author=Jeremy Korzeniewski|work=Autoblog}}</ref> to commemorate the final year. These models are painted red with white [[Racing stripe|stripes]], paying tribute to the famous race-winning [[Oreca]] cars. The RT/10 was replaced by the SRT-10 roadster in 2003, and the GTS was replaced in 2006 by the SRT-10 coup\u00e9.\n\nColors would vary throughout the second generation. Dodge would offer three or four colors per model year. Some colors such as steel gray were only offered for one model year (MY2000) while other colors such as red were offered during the entire second generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theviperstore.com/Viper_Paint_Codes.htm|title=Dodge Viper Paint Codes and factory Colors information|work=theviperstore.com}}</ref>  Interior colors and wheel options would also vary throughout the second generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgeviperhistoricalsociety.com/build_info.htm|title=Dodge Viper Historical Society, Build Info|work=dodgeviperhistoricalsociety.com}}</ref> The cobalt blue colour of the Dodge Viper GTS seen in the [[Viper (TV series)]] was exclusively available to the series.\n\nStripes would be an option beginning in 1996. The GTS stripes were larger, fuller stripes than the stripes offered on the 96 RT/10. The GTS had twin stripes (8 inches wide with a 4-inch gap in between) that ran from the front bumper all the way through the rear bumper. 1996 was the only model year in which the stripes would run through the rear [[license plate]] area. Stripes on later models would run from front to rear but did not run through the rear license plate area.\n\n=== {{anchor|ZB}} Third generation (ZB I, 2003\u20132007) ===\n{{Main|Dodge Viper (ZB I)}}\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = 2005-03-04 Motorshow Geneva 117.JPG\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = 2005-03-04 Motorshow Geneva 120.JPG\n| caption2 = The third generation of the Viper would receive heavy design updates, designed by Osamu Shikado.\n}}\nThe Dodge Viper underwent a major redesign in 2002, courtesy of DaimlerChrysler's [[Street and Racing Technology]] group, taking cues from the Dodge Viper GTS-R concept presented in 2000. The new Viper SRT-10, which replaced both the GTS and the RT/10, was heavily restyled with sharp, angled bodywork. The engine's displacement was increased to {{convert|8285|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, which, with other upgrades, increased the maximum power output to {{convert|500|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|525|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,200 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2003-dodge-viper-srt-10-first-drive-review|title=2003 Dodge Viper SRT-10|date=May 2002|first=Barry|last=Winfield|publisher=[[Car & Driver]]|access-date=September 30, 2018}}</ref> Despite the power increase, the engine weight was reduced to about {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The chassis was also improved, becoming more rigid and weighing approximately {{convert|80|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than the previous model. An even lighter and stronger chassis was planned, but was abandoned because of cost. The initial model introduced was a convertible. In 2004, Dodge introduced a limited-edition Mamba package; Mamba-edition cars featured black interiors, with red stitching and trim, price increased by about $3,000. 200 cars with the Mamba package  were produced.\n\nThe Viper SRT-10 Coup\u00e9 was introduced at the 2005 [[Detroit Auto Show]] as a 2006 model. It shares many of its body panels with the convertible, but borrows its side and rear styling from the Competition Coup\u00e9 concept. The coup\u00e9 looks much like the previous Viper GTS and retains the \"double-bubble\" roof shape of the original along with the original GTS' tail lights, as well as offering the original GTS Blue with white stripes paint scheme on the initial run of First Edition cars like the original Viper coup\u00e9. The engine is [[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]]-certified to produce a maximum power output of {{convert|510|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|535|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,200 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/viper/2006/2006-dodge-viper-srt10-coupe/|title=ROAD TEST: 2006 DODGE VIPER SRT10 COUPE|date=January 3, 2006|first=Matt|last=Stone|publisher=MotorTrend|access-date=September 30, 2018}}</ref> Unlike the original coup\u00e9, the chassis was not modified.\n\nNo cars were produced for the 2007 model year; instead, Chrysler extended production of the 2006 model while preparing the updated 2008 model.\n\n=== {{anchor|fourth}} Fourth generation (ZB II, 2008\u20132010) ===\n{{main|Dodge Viper (ZB II)}}\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = San Francisco, Dodge Viper SRT-10.jpg\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Dodge Viper 4th Generation Toronto.JPG\n| caption2 = The fourth generation of the Viper would receive heavy mechanical changes over its predecessor and a redesigned engine cover\n}}\n\nIn 2008, with the introduction of the {{cvt|8382|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[V10 engine]], the power output was raised to {{convert|600 or 608|PS|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,100 rpm and {{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,000 rpm.

The engine was developed with some external assistance from [[McLaren Automotive]] and [[Ricardo Consulting Engineers]]. [[Electronic control unit|Electronic engine control]] was developed by [[Continental AG]]; the controller can monitor the [[crankshaft]] and [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit.\n\nChanges outside of the engine were less extreme, but a distinction between the third and fourth generation of the Viper is the vented engine cover. The [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56 transmission]] was replaced with a new [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|Tremec TR6060]] with triple first-gear [[Synchronizer (automotive)|synchronizers]] and doubles for higher gears. The [[Dana 44|Dana M44-4]] [[rear axle]] from the 2003\u20132006 model now had a [[GKN]] ViscoLok speed-sensing [[limited-slip differential]] that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under [[acceleration]]. Another performance upgrade was the removal of [[run-flat tire]]s; the new [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] (springs, [[anti-roll bar]]s, and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.\n\n{{Citation needed span|The modifications made to the 2008 [[model year]] car were enough for [[Chrysler]] to make it distinct from the first SRT-10, and the 2008 model became known as Gen IV,|date=February 2009}} just in time for release with [[Chevrolet]]'s {{convert|638|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Corvette ZR1]]. Another notable change was the reworked [[exhaust system]]; previous third-generation cars had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, which was done initially to help improve the car's exhaust note, since the first two generations of the Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes. The car now featured a new exhaust system with no crossover, reducing the heat that entered the cockpit.\n\nThe electrical system was completely revised for 2008. Changes included a 180-amp [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], twin electric [[cooling fan]]s, electronic [[throttle]]s, and completely new VENOM [[engine management system]]. CAN bus architecture had been combined with pre-existing systems to allow for regulatory compliance. The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher-capacity [[fuel pump]] and filtration system.<ref>{{cite web |title= First Look: 2008 Dodge Viper Coupe and Convertible |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/112_0702_2008_dodge_viper/engine.html |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=June 18, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Viper ACR made a return for the ZB II generation and was put through its paces at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] clocking in a record time of 7:22.1.

The car's Viper-derived V10 engine generates {{convert|745|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. According to the company, it can accelerate from {{convert|0-60|mph|kph|abbr=on}} in a 3.0 seconds and can attain a maximum speed of {{convert|218|mph|kph|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Concept vehicles ==\n=== Viper GTS-R Concept ===\n[[File:2000 Dodge Viper GTS-R Concept (31740152596).jpg|thumb|Dodge Viper Competition Coup\u00e9 at the Chrysler Museum]] \nTen years after the first Viper Concept was revealed, the 2000 GTS-R concept was shown. Osamu Shikado was responsible for the vehicle's exterior which is 3&nbsp;inches lower and 2&nbsp;inches wider than the production Viper at the time. Shikado used race inspired lines with an aggressive stance. Most of these design cues were adapted to the 2003 ZB I generation Viper along with the interior. These included a higher belt line, a side gill, 'bump-up' rear fender shape, and a more defined side crease. Viewed from above, the front-to-rear stripe now is tapered.\n\nUnlike most concepts, the 2000 Viper Concept was made as a complete car. It features a complete functional interior with air conditioning, adjustable pedals, and a premium sounds system. Only one was ever made featuring a dry-sump V10 engine producing {{cvt|500|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, fifty more than the then outgoing model, and {{cvt|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The body is a single moulded carbon-fiber shell, with some subtle changes compared with the then outgoing model. An inch and a half has been taken out between the sill and the roof, which together with a chassis sitting two inches lower, gives the car a lower profile. Three inches have been added to the wheelbase and two inches to the track. The doors have also been lengthened, which combined with the longer wheelbase makes entry and exit from the car easier. Brakes are 14-inch ventilated discs with four-piston calipers. The front has the 19-inch wheels with P285/30 ZR Goodyear tires up and 20-inch rear wheels with P335/30 ZR tires.\n\n=== Mopar Concept Coup\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Viper Mopar.JPG|right|thumb|\"Mopar Concept Coup\u00e9\" Viper at the 2007 [[Detroit Auto Show]]]]\nA prototype 2008 [[Mopar]] Viper coup\u00e9, with {{convert|675|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, appeared at the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|2007 North American International Auto Show]], but was not planned for production. The concept appeared to have been a sneak peek at the then upcoming ZB II Viper ACR. Performance parts from this car are sold by [[Mopar]].\n\n=== SRT-10 Carbon ===\nFor the 2003 [[SEMA#2003|SEMA]] show, Chrysler displayed a highly tuned Viper SRT-10 in coup\u00e9 body style. The vehicle's name comes from the carbon fiber used to reduce the weight by 150&nbsp;lbs bringing the total to  3,200&nbsp;lbs. However, even more significant were the engine modifications, which increased power to {{cvt|625|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}; no torque or RPM figures were given. Along with the carbon fiber hardtop, a front splitter and rear wing were added; however those parts were not nearly as significant as those on the later SRT-10 ACR, and no downforce/drag information was provided to show that they were even functional. The car was only a concept.\n\nThis car was used as a test mule for the development for the Generation V SRT Viper. The car is no longer a show car, and most of its specialty parts were taken off during development for the new Generation V SRT Viper.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.insideline.com/dodge/viper/2003-sema-dodge-viper-srt-10-carbon.html |title=Dodge Viper SRT-10 Carbon |first=Ron |last=Batt |date=September 15, 2009 |publisher=insideline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101208153606/http://www.insideline.com/dodge/viper/2003-sema-dodge-viper-srt-10-carbon.html |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Firepower ===\n{{Main|Chrysler Firepower}}\nThe [[Chrysler Firepower]] was a grand touring concept based on the Viper chassis that would have been equipped with the Hemi [[V8 engine]] coupled with an [[automatic transmission]].

It was powered by Chrysler's 2.7&nbsp;L [[Chrysler LH engine|LH]] V6 engine instead of the Viper's V10, which produced {{convert|220|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}}. It never reached production. Dodge produced a limited-production Copperhead Edition Dodge Viper, with copper-colored paint similar to the concept car and other changes.\n\n=== SEMA Concept ===\n\nThe SEMA concept car is a version of 2013 SRT Viper coupe demonstrating Mopar products for SRT Viper. Changes include yellow body colour, carbon fiber parts at underhood, exposed carbon fiber performance cross X-Brace trimmed in a satin finish, a decal-cut Viper \"Stryker\" logo in the center of X-Brace, engine cover in carbon fiber and aluminum with the SRT logo, prototype aluminum oil filler cap with the SRT logo, a carbon fiber aero package, Mopar coil springs, full black interior with yellow accents, Sabelt hard-shell seats with a six-point safety harness, seat edging in black Katzkin leather with yellow accents in the perforations, Mopar billet aluminum shift knob, billet aluminum HVAC bezels and controls, carbon fiber bulkhead satchel with a universal integrated quick-release camera mount, polished chrome door-sill guards with the Viper logo, race-inspired sand-blasted aluminum Mopar bright pedal kit with the Viper logo etched in the pedals, footrest pedal with \"Stryker\" logo, optional \"Track Pack\" wheels finished in hyperblack, a front tow hook and an LED fog lamp kit.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in the 2012 [[SEMA#2012|SEMA]] show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/10/12/chrysler-previews-sema-showcars/|title=Chrysler previews SEMA showcars}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-llc-reveals-custom-vehicles-headed-for-2012-sema-show-173885081.html|title=Chrysler Group LLC Reveals Custom Vehicles Headed for 2012 SEMA Show}}</ref>\n\nThe Mopar performance parts found in the SEMA concept car were sold as 2013 SRT Viper components.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/10/31/2013-srt-viper-with-mopar-accessories-sema-2012/|title=2013 SRT Viper with Mopar accessories shines at SEMA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mopar-announces-top-performance-parts-and-accessories-for-all-new-2013-srt-viper-176576231.html|title=Mopar Announces Top Performance Parts and Accessories for All-new 2013 SRT Viper}}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Viper Television Series (1994\u20131998) ===\n{{Main|Viper (TV series)}}\n\nChrysler launched a TV series called [[Viper (TV series)|Viper]] in 1994 to serve as a promotional tool for the Viper. The show ran until 1998 with 1 NBC season and 3 syndicated follow-up seasons. Viper is a TV series about a special task force set up by the federal government to fight crime in the fictional city of Metro City, California that is perpetually under siege from one crime wave after another. The weapon used by this task force is a grey assault vehicle known as ''The Defender'' that masquerades as a Dodge Viper RT/10 roadster (and later, the Viper GTS coupe). The series takes place in \"the near future\". The primary brand of vehicles driven in the show were Chrysler or subsidiary companies. The series ran on NBC for one season in 1994 before being revived two years later for three more seasons of first-run syndication. Reruns of the series have appeared on Sci-Fi Channel and USA Network.\n\nThe Viper Defender \"star car\" was designed by Chrysler Corporation engineers unlike most Hollywood Film/TV cars that are usually customized by film picture designers. The car was built on a heavily modified RT/10 Chassis and is a completely functional prototype. Only 14 Defenders were made. The exterior design of the car was produced by Chrysler stylist Steve Ferrerio.\n\nThe Defender is a fictional assault vehicle that is said to be a highly sophisticated vehicle (contrary to the normal Viper's spartan nature) that can, at the flick of a switch, transform from a red RT/10 (later a blue GTS) into a grey/silver weaponized armored coupe.\n\n== Motorsport ==\n[[File:Lemans_chrysler_viper.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A Chrysler Viper GTS-R running at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n[[File:3_Greg_Crick_(TAS),_Dodge_Viper_GTS_ACR.JPG|thumb|right|The Dodge Viper GTS-ACR that won the [[2006 Australian GT Championship]]|220x220px]]\n[[File:Dodge Viper Coupe.JPG|thumb|right|A Viper Competition Coupe GT3 being driven by a privateer team]]\n\n=== Phase SR II ===\n{{Main|Chrysler Viper GTS-R}}\nIn 1996, a race car based on the Viper was built, and was called the Chrysler Viper GTS-R (in American races, was named the Dodge Viper GTS-R). The construction was done by [[Chrysler]] and by the teams [[Reynard Motorsport]] and [[Oreca]]. The numbers the car used were vast, with numbers like #91, #51, #2, #92, and #52.\n\nThe car was unveiled in 1996 at the [[IMSA GT Championship]], with the team Canaska Southwind, which competed in the GTS-1 class, the highest for GTS classes. Its first race was at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and managed to finish at the 29th position, but fortunately the team would improve greatly, finishing 12th position in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. The car wasn't able to reach much further however, which meant the team had to switch to GTS-2. [[Oreca]] had planned for racing in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with their own GTS-R.\n\nBoth teams appeared at the [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] each with two entries.  Three of those four cars managed to finish with Canaska Southwind earning the best result in tenth place.  The two teams returned to their respective series afterwards. Oreca finished the year with three races in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] getting an eighth place at [[Brands Hatch]], ninth at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]], and sixth at [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro]]. Canaska Southwind concluded the season by finishing second in class at [[Mosport]] and sixth overall.\n\nFor the later years 1999 and 2000, the efforts made by Oreca had expanded, racing in both the [[ALMS]] and [[FIA GT Championship]] respectively, earning them nine wins, and one by the racing team [[Paul Belmondo]]. Another team named Chamberlain had improved to finish second overall in the FIA GT. Back at ALMS, Oreca had taken the title, with six wins. Later at Le Mans, Oreca would go on to win their second consecutive win, with the top six positions in every class being taken by various GTS-Rs. The GTS-R had made its first appearance in the [[FFSA GT Championship]], and saw the first overall win for [[Zakspeed]] in the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring|24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring]]. Oreca left the FIA GT in 1999 to focus on ALMS, leaving the privateers to race there, and got 11 races out of it for Oreca. They did lose to the then-new [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] factory racing team, but still won the championship. Back at the FIA GT, the Viper racing teams won four races, but were outrun by the [[Lister Storm]] racing teams, with them winning five races for them. This let them settle for second and third. In the FFSA, the three teams DDO, ART, and MMI teams would win a total of eight victories.\n\nThe Oreca racing team had left competition to focus on [[Le Mans Prototype]] racing for 2001. The rest of the teams left at later years, and the Viper GTS-R began fading by 2004, then left completely by 2010.\n\nIn 2006, a modified Dodge Viper GTS-ACR driven by Greg Crick under the team Crickcars.com entered the [[Australian GT Championship]] and won it, with 713 points in total.\n\n=== Phase ZB I ===\n\nA new race car called the Viper Competition Coupe took the GTS-R's place for the second phase. The Viper Competition Coupe had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the road legal Viper, but increased power to {{convert|520|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|540|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.<ref name=\"SRT Heritage\">{{cite web | url = http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/heritage/viper-competition-coupe/ | title = Viper Competition Coupe | publisher = Street & Racing Technology | accessdate = May 20, 2017}}</ref> The Competition Coupe had a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no interior trim and an [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-legal roll cage.  The exterior design of the Competition Coupe was based on the Viper GTS-R concept from 2000. Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper included a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone suspension system, new spherical bearing control arm attachments, two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable blade-type rear anti-roll bar. The anti-lock braking system added a distribution control system.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/viper/competition-coupe.html|title=2003 Dodge Viper Competition Coupe: Racing Only|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref> The initial price of the car is around $100,000.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe Viper Competition Coupe was initially built for use in the Viper Challenge Championship one-make series starting in 2003.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Competition Coupe was later adapted for use in the [[Group GT3]] instituted by the FIA, allowing its use in a variety of series in Europe and North America. French racing team [[Oreca]] made further modifications to the car, to allow it to race in Group GT2. Privateer teams used these cars to compete for certain series, with Racing Box in Europe for the [[International GT Open]] and Woodhouse Racing and Primetime Race Group in the United States carrying out independent programs in the [[American Le Mans Series]].\n\n=== Phase VX I ===\n\n==== SRT Viper GTS-R ====\n[[File:2013 SRT Viper GTR-R.JPG|thumb|An SRT Viper GTS-R performing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans|220x220px]]\n\nThe GTS-R returned in competition, but this time as an [[LM GTE]] class race car and instead, was constructed and designed by SRT Motorsports and [[Riley Technologies]]. It includes Michelin GT tires. The car retained the number #91 but had a new number for it called #93.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 New York Auto Show, and it made its racing debut at the [[2012 Mid-Ohio Sports Car Challenge]] where two GTS-Rs, driven by Kuno Wittmer and [[Dominik Farnbacher]] with car #91, and [[Marc Goossens]] and [[Tommy Kendall]] with car #93, finished 10th and 12th in the GT class, which was 23rd and 25th overall.\n\nThe racing team entering 2012 [[ALMS]] included Dominik Farnbacher, Marc Goossens, [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]], Tommy Kendall, [[Jonathan Bomarito]], and Kuno Wittmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/05/2013-srt-viper-gts-r-alms-2012-new%20york/|title=2013 SRT Viper coils up to take a bite out of ALMS with GTS-R competition model|last=Joseph|first=Noah|date=April 5, 2012|publisher=autoblog|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe two GTS-Rs of SRT Motorsports finished 3rd in the GT class championship.

In the opening round, the [[2014 24 Hours of Daytona]], SRT took 3rd and 6th in class (12th and 27th overall, completing 675 and 653 laps respectively). Both cars were repainted at Watkins Glen in the red and white livery used in the late 1990s to early 2000s. The No. 93 Viper won class at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Brickyard Grand Prix in July 2014, after both cars took podium positions in the previous races at The Glen and Mosport.\n\nIn March 2014, Chrysler announced that it was withdrawing the Vipers from the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref name=\"lm24\" /> The Vipers ended the season at [[Petit Le Mans]] with a team championship and driver's championship by Kuno Wittmer.

Public reaction was so enthusiastic that chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was directed to develop it as a standard [[production vehicle]].\n\nSjoberg selected 85 engineers to be \"Team Viper\", with development beginning in March 1989. The team asked the then-Chrysler subsidiary [[Lamborghini]] to cast a prototype aluminum block for the sports car to use in May. The production body was completed in fall 1989, with a [[chassis]] prototype running in December. Though a [[V8 engine]] was first used in the [[Development mule|test mule]], the V10 engine, which the production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990. Official approval from Chrysler chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] came in May 1990. One year later, [[Carroll Shelby]] piloted a [[pre-production car]] as the [[Safety car|pace vehicle]] in the [[Indianapolis 500]] race. In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with the first [[retail]] shipments beginning in January 1992.\n\n== {{anchor|SR}} Models ==\n=== {{anchor|first}} First generation (SR I; 1991&ndash;1995) ===\n{{Main|Dodge Viper (SR I)}}{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = DODGE Viper Gen 1.JPG\n| image2 = Dodge Viper RT-10 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (13).jpg\n| image3 = 1992 Dodge Viper engine.JPG\n| caption3 = Dodge Viper (SR I).\n}}\nThe first prototype was tested in January 1989.

The roof was made from [[canvas]], and the windows were made from vinyl and used zippers to open and close, much like the [[Jeep Wrangler (YJ)|Jeep Wrangler]]. However, the Viper was still equipped with some domestic features, including manually-adjustable sport leather-trimmed [[bucket seat]]s with lumbar support, an [[Vehicle audio|AM-FM stereo cassette player]] with clock and [[high fidelity]] sound system, and interior carpeting. Aluminium [[alloy wheels]] were larger in diameter due to the larger [[brake]]s. A lightweight [[fiberglass]] [[Hardtop|hard roof]] option on later models was also available to cover the canvas soft roof, and was shipped with each new car. There were also no [[airbags]], in the interest of weight reduction.

The [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] relocated the exposed side [[exhaust pipe]]s to a single [[muffler]] at the rear exiting via two large central [[tailpipe]]s during the middle of the model year, which reduced back pressure, and therefore increased the power to {{convert|415|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. [[Torque]] would also increase by {{convert|23|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|488|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A removable [[hardtop]] was now available along with a sliding glass window.

In 1997, the RT/10 would receive a power increase to 450&nbsp;hp along with air-bags and power windows. In 1998, both of the versions of the Viper were equipped with second-generation air bags, revised [[exhaust manifold]]s (saving {{convert|24|lb|0|abbr=on}} over the previous cast iron components) along with a revised [[camshaft]].\n\nIn 1998, the GT2 Commemorative Edition was released. With the FIA GT2 Team and Driver series wins in October 1997, Team Viper set forth with the creation of a unique Viper called the GT2 Commemorative Edition. There would be 100 offered through the top Dodge Viper dealers.\n\nThe team started working on the concept in November 1997 with design concept approve in January 1998, prototype parts in February 1998, pricing approval of $85,200 in April 1998, and production from June 16 to July 7, 1998. The vehicles were the first to be built in VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) sequential order with the first having 001 as its last three on the VIN and the last being 100.\n\nThe GT2 exterior is best known for its white with blue stripes paint, large rear wing, front dive planes and splitter, side sills, American flag, BBS rims, and GTS-R badging. Its this badging that causes many to refer to the vehicle as the GTS-R. However, the GTS-R was the race version of the Viper and not street legal.\n\nThe GT2 interior is best known for the blue accent trim, Oreca 5-point racing harness, and the center dash plaque with the vehicles unique production number.\n\nThe GT2 power increased by 10 horsepower to 460 HP with the use of K&N air filter and smooth tubes connecting the filter to the intake manifold. Torque increased by 10 to 500 foot pounds.\n\nOf the 100 number vehicles, number 100 was kept by the Chrysler museum until it was later sold into private ownership. Number 051 was given to Oreca Team driver Olivier Beretta. However, due to Monaco's import regulations, Olivier was unable to take delivery. The vehicle was later sold at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale's auction and is in private hands. Number 052 was given to Oreca Team driver Justin Bell. He kept the vehicle for several years before being sold into private hands.\n\nThe GT2 is regarded as the pinnacle of the Gen II (Generation Two) GTS Viper coupe collectability.\n\nAny reference to the GT2 being built to meet any homologation effort are inaccurate.\n\nIn 1999, ACR performance package was released.  With the increase of Viper owner's \"tracking\" their vehicles, Team Viper created a track ready version of the GTS.\n\nThe ACR used the same K&N air filter and smooth tubes from the GT2 for the power gains along with the BBS rims.  A new 5-point harness with the ACR logo was installed for both the driver and passenger.  For 1999, Koni adjustable shocks were installed and changed to Dynamics later in the 2000 model year.  Lastly, the spring rates were increased.  The vehicle could be painted in solid color or with stripes with the color choices changing yearly.  The ACR came standard with air conditioning and radio deleted, but could be added back in as a $10,000 option.  A small amount were produced yearly that were AC and radio delete.\n\nIn 2000, the Dodge Viper was updated to lighter [[hypereutectic]] [[piston]]s and received factory frame improvements. While the hypereutectic pistons provided less expansion, the [[forged]] pistons were preferred by customers for the [[supercharged]] and [[turbocharged]] aftermarket packages. TSB ([[Technical Service Bulletin]]) recalls (998 and 999) were done at local dealerships to repair the 1996 to 1999 Viper frames by adding gussets with rivets near the steering box. 2001 saw the addition of [[Anti-lock braking system]].\n\n2002 would be the final year of the second generation of the Viper. Dodge would build 360 \u201cFinal Edition\u201d cars (326 coup\u00e9s and 34 ACR editions)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/06/dodge-slithers-out-new-2010-viper-final-edition/|title=Dodge slithers out new 2010 Viper Final Edition models|author=Jeremy Korzeniewski|work=Autoblog}}</ref> to commemorate the final year. These models are painted red with white [[Racing stripe|stripes]], paying tribute to the famous race-winning [[Oreca]] cars. The RT/10 was replaced by the SRT-10 roadster in 2003, and the GTS was replaced in 2006 by the SRT-10 coup\u00e9.\n\nColors would vary throughout the second generation. Dodge would offer three or four colors per model year. Some colors such as steel gray were only offered for one model year (MY2000) while other colors such as red were offered during the entire second generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theviperstore.com/Viper_Paint_Codes.htm|title=Dodge Viper Paint Codes and factory Colors information|work=theviperstore.com}}</ref>  Interior colors and wheel options would also vary throughout the second generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgeviperhistoricalsociety.com/build_info.htm|title=Dodge Viper Historical Society, Build Info|work=dodgeviperhistoricalsociety.com}}</ref> The cobalt blue colour of the Dodge Viper GTS seen in the [[Viper (TV series)]] was exclusively available to the series.\n\nStripes would be an option beginning in 1996. The GTS stripes were larger, fuller stripes than the stripes offered on the 96 RT/10. The GTS had twin stripes (8 inches wide with a 4-inch gap in between) that ran from the front bumper all the way through the rear bumper. 1996 was the only model year in which the stripes would run through the rear [[license plate]] area.

The chassis was also improved, becoming more rigid and weighing approximately {{convert|80|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than the previous model. An even lighter and stronger chassis was planned, but was abandoned because of cost. The initial model introduced was a convertible. In 2004, Dodge introduced a limited-edition Mamba package; Mamba-edition cars featured black interiors, with red stitching and trim, price increased by about $3,000. 200 cars with the Mamba package  were produced.\n\nThe Viper SRT-10 Coup\u00e9 was introduced at the 2005 [[Detroit Auto Show]] as a 2006 model. It shares many of its body panels with the convertible, but borrows its side and rear styling from the Competition Coup\u00e9 concept. The coup\u00e9 looks much like the previous Viper GTS and retains the \"double-bubble\" roof shape of the original along with the original GTS' tail lights, as well as offering the original GTS Blue with white stripes paint scheme on the initial run of First Edition cars like the original Viper coup\u00e9.

The engine was developed with some external assistance from [[McLaren Automotive]] and [[Ricardo Consulting Engineers]]. [[Electronic control unit|Electronic engine control]] was developed by [[Continental AG]]; the controller can monitor the [[crankshaft]] and [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit.\n\nChanges outside of the engine were less extreme, but a distinction between the third and fourth generation of the Viper is the vented engine cover. The [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56 transmission]] was replaced with a new [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|Tremec TR6060]] with triple first-gear [[Synchronizer (automotive)|synchronizers]] and doubles for higher gears. The [[Dana 44|Dana M44-4]] [[rear axle]] from the 2003\u20132006 model now had a [[GKN]] ViscoLok speed-sensing [[limited-slip differential]] that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under [[acceleration]]. Another performance upgrade was the removal of [[run-flat tire]]s; the new [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] (springs, [[anti-roll bar]]s, and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.\n\n{{Citation needed span|The modifications made to the 2008 [[model year]] car were enough for [[Chrysler]] to make it distinct from the first SRT-10, and the 2008 model became known as Gen IV,|date=February 2009}} just in time for release with [[Chevrolet]]'s {{convert|638|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Corvette ZR1]]. Another notable change was the reworked [[exhaust system]]; previous third-generation cars had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, which was done initially to help improve the car's exhaust note, since the first two generations of the Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes. The car now featured a new exhaust system with no crossover, reducing the heat that entered the cockpit.\n\nThe electrical system was completely revised for 2008. Changes included a 180-amp [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], twin electric [[cooling fan]]s, electronic [[throttle]]s, and completely new VENOM [[engine management system]]. CAN bus architecture had been combined with pre-existing systems to allow for regulatory compliance. The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher-capacity [[fuel pump]] and filtration system.<ref>{{cite web |title= First Look: 2008 Dodge Viper Coupe and Convertible |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/112_0702_2008_dodge_viper/engine.html |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=June 18, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Viper ACR made a return for the ZB II generation and was put through its paces at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] clocking in a record time of 7:22.1.

Osamu Shikado was responsible for the vehicle's exterior which is 3&nbsp;inches lower and 2&nbsp;inches wider than the production Viper at the time. Shikado used race inspired lines with an aggressive stance. Most of these design cues were adapted to the 2003 ZB I generation Viper along with the interior. These included a higher belt line, a side gill, 'bump-up' rear fender shape, and a more defined side crease. Viewed from above, the front-to-rear stripe now is tapered.\n\nUnlike most concepts, the 2000 Viper Concept was made as a complete car. It features a complete functional interior with air conditioning, adjustable pedals, and a premium sounds system. Only one was ever made featuring a dry-sump V10 engine producing {{cvt|500|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, fifty more than the then outgoing model, and {{cvt|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The body is a single moulded carbon-fiber shell, with some subtle changes compared with the then outgoing model. An inch and a half has been taken out between the sill and the roof, which together with a chassis sitting two inches lower, gives the car a lower profile. Three inches have been added to the wheelbase and two inches to the track. The doors have also been lengthened, which combined with the longer wheelbase makes entry and exit from the car easier. Brakes are 14-inch ventilated discs with four-piston calipers. The front has the 19-inch wheels with P285/30 ZR Goodyear tires up and 20-inch rear wheels with P335/30 ZR tires.\n\n=== Mopar Concept Coup\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Viper Mopar.JPG|right|thumb|\"Mopar Concept Coup\u00e9\" Viper at the 2007 [[Detroit Auto Show]]]]\nA prototype 2008 [[Mopar]] Viper coup\u00e9, with {{convert|675|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, appeared at the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|2007 North American International Auto Show]], but was not planned for production. The concept appeared to have been a sneak peek at the then upcoming ZB II Viper ACR. Performance parts from this car are sold by [[Mopar]].\n\n=== SRT-10 Carbon ===\nFor the 2003 [[SEMA#2003|SEMA]] show, Chrysler displayed a highly tuned Viper SRT-10 in coup\u00e9 body style. The vehicle's name comes from the carbon fiber used to reduce the weight by 150&nbsp;lbs bringing the total to  3,200&nbsp;lbs. However, even more significant were the engine modifications, which increased power to {{cvt|625|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}; no torque or RPM figures were given. Along with the carbon fiber hardtop, a front splitter and rear wing were added; however those parts were not nearly as significant as those on the later SRT-10 ACR, and no downforce/drag information was provided to show that they were even functional. The car was only a concept.\n\nThis car was used as a test mule for the development for the Generation V SRT Viper. The car is no longer a show car, and most of its specialty parts were taken off during development for the new Generation V SRT Viper.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.insideline.com/dodge/viper/2003-sema-dodge-viper-srt-10-carbon.html |title=Dodge Viper SRT-10 Carbon |first=Ron |last=Batt |date=September 15, 2009 |publisher=insideline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101208153606/http://www.insideline.com/dodge/viper/2003-sema-dodge-viper-srt-10-carbon.html |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Firepower ===\n{{Main|Chrysler Firepower}}\nThe [[Chrysler Firepower]] was a grand touring concept based on the Viper chassis that would have been equipped with the Hemi [[V8 engine]] coupled with an [[automatic transmission]].

Viper is a TV series about a special task force set up by the federal government to fight crime in the fictional city of Metro City, California that is perpetually under siege from one crime wave after another. The weapon used by this task force is a grey assault vehicle known as ''The Defender'' that masquerades as a Dodge Viper RT/10 roadster (and later, the Viper GTS coupe). The series takes place in \"the near future\". The primary brand of vehicles driven in the show were Chrysler or subsidiary companies. The series ran on NBC for one season in 1994 before being revived two years later for three more seasons of first-run syndication. Reruns of the series have appeared on Sci-Fi Channel and USA Network.\n\nThe Viper Defender \"star car\" was designed by Chrysler Corporation engineers unlike most Hollywood Film/TV cars that are usually customized by film picture designers. The car was built on a heavily modified RT/10 Chassis and is a completely functional prototype. Only 14 Defenders were made. The exterior design of the car was produced by Chrysler stylist Steve Ferrerio.\n\nThe Defender is a fictional assault vehicle that is said to be a highly sophisticated vehicle (contrary to the normal Viper's spartan nature) that can, at the flick of a switch, transform from a red RT/10 (later a blue GTS) into a grey/silver weaponized armored coupe.\n\n== Motorsport ==\n[[File:Lemans_chrysler_viper.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A Chrysler Viper GTS-R running at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n[[File:3_Greg_Crick_(TAS),_Dodge_Viper_GTS_ACR.JPG|thumb|right|The Dodge Viper GTS-ACR that won the [[2006 Australian GT Championship]]|220x220px]]\n[[File:Dodge Viper Coupe.JPG|thumb|right|A Viper Competition Coupe GT3 being driven by a privateer team]]\n\n=== Phase SR II ===\n{{Main|Chrysler Viper GTS-R}}\nIn 1996, a race car based on the Viper was built, and was called the Chrysler Viper GTS-R (in American races, was named the Dodge Viper GTS-R). The construction was done by [[Chrysler]] and by the teams [[Reynard Motorsport]] and [[Oreca]]. The numbers the car used were vast, with numbers like #91, #51, #2, #92, and #52.\n\nThe car was unveiled in 1996 at the [[IMSA GT Championship]], with the team Canaska Southwind, which competed in the GTS-1 class, the highest for GTS classes. Its first race was at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and managed to finish at the 29th position, but fortunately the team would improve greatly, finishing 12th position in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. The car wasn't able to reach much further however, which meant the team had to switch to GTS-2. [[Oreca]] had planned for racing in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with their own GTS-R.\n\nBoth teams appeared at the [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] each with two entries.  Three of those four cars managed to finish with Canaska Southwind earning the best result in tenth place.  The two teams returned to their respective series afterwards. Oreca finished the year with three races in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] getting an eighth place at [[Brands Hatch]], ninth at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]], and sixth at [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro]]. Canaska Southwind concluded the season by finishing second in class at [[Mosport]] and sixth overall.\n\nFor the later years 1999 and 2000, the efforts made by Oreca had expanded, racing in both the [[ALMS]] and [[FIA GT Championship]] respectively, earning them nine wins, and one by the racing team [[Paul Belmondo]]. Another team named Chamberlain had improved to finish second overall in the FIA GT. Back at ALMS, Oreca had taken the title, with six wins. Later at Le Mans, Oreca would go on to win their second consecutive win, with the top six positions in every class being taken by various GTS-Rs. The GTS-R had made its first appearance in the [[FFSA GT Championship]], and saw the first overall win for [[Zakspeed]] in the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring|24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring]]. Oreca left the FIA GT in 1999 to focus on ALMS, leaving the privateers to race there, and got 11 races out of it for Oreca. They did lose to the then-new [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] factory racing team, but still won the championship. Back at the FIA GT, the Viper racing teams won four races, but were outrun by the [[Lister Storm]] racing teams, with them winning five races for them. This let them settle for second and third. In the FFSA, the three teams DDO, ART, and MMI teams would win a total of eight victories.\n\nThe Oreca racing team had left competition to focus on [[Le Mans Prototype]] racing for 2001. The rest of the teams left at later years, and the Viper GTS-R began fading by 2004, then left completely by 2010.\n\nIn 2006, a modified Dodge Viper GTS-ACR driven by Greg Crick under the team Crickcars.com entered the [[Australian GT Championship]] and won it, with 713 points in total.\n\n=== Phase ZB I ===\n\nA new race car called the Viper Competition Coupe took the GTS-R's place for the second phase. The Viper Competition Coupe had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the road legal Viper, but increased power to {{convert|520|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|540|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.<ref name=\"SRT Heritage\">{{cite web | url = http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/heritage/viper-competition-coupe/ | title = Viper Competition Coupe | publisher = Street & Racing Technology | accessdate = May 20, 2017}}</ref> The Competition Coupe had a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no interior trim and an [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-legal roll cage.  The exterior design of the Competition Coupe was based on the Viper GTS-R concept from 2000. Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper included a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone suspension system, new spherical bearing control arm attachments, two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable blade-type rear anti-roll bar. The anti-lock braking system added a distribution control system.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/viper/competition-coupe.html|title=2003 Dodge Viper Competition Coupe: Racing Only|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref> The initial price of the car is around $100,000.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe Viper Competition Coupe was initially built for use in the Viper Challenge Championship one-make series starting in 2003.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Competition Coupe was later adapted for use in the [[Group GT3]] instituted by the FIA, allowing its use in a variety of series in Europe and North America. French racing team [[Oreca]] made further modifications to the car, to allow it to race in Group GT2. Privateer teams used these cars to compete for certain series, with Racing Box in Europe for the [[International GT Open]] and Woodhouse Racing and Primetime Race Group in the United States carrying out independent programs in the [[American Le Mans Series]].\n\n=== Phase VX I ===\n\n==== SRT Viper GTS-R ====\n[[File:2013 SRT Viper GTR-R.JPG|thumb|An SRT Viper GTS-R performing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans|220x220px]]\n\nThe GTS-R returned in competition, but this time as an [[LM GTE]] class race car and instead, was constructed and designed by SRT Motorsports and [[Riley Technologies]]. It includes Michelin GT tires. The car retained the number #91 but had a new number for it called #93.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 New York Auto Show, and it made its racing debut at the [[2012 Mid-Ohio Sports Car Challenge]] where two GTS-Rs, driven by Kuno Wittmer and [[Dominik Farnbacher]] with car #91, and [[Marc Goossens]] and [[Tommy Kendall]] with car #93, finished 10th and 12th in the GT class, which was 23rd and 25th overall.\n\nThe racing team entering 2012 [[ALMS]] included Dominik Farnbacher, Marc Goossens, [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]], Tommy Kendall, [[Jonathan Bomarito]], and Kuno Wittmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/05/2013-srt-viper-gts-r-alms-2012-new%20york/|title=2013 SRT Viper coils up to take a bite out of ALMS with GTS-R competition model|last=Joseph|first=Noah|date=April 5, 2012|publisher=autoblog|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe two GTS-Rs of SRT Motorsports finished 3rd in the GT class championship.

In the opening round, the [[2014 24 Hours of Daytona]], SRT took 3rd and 6th in class (12th and 27th overall, completing 675 and 653 laps respectively). Both cars were repainted at Watkins Glen in the red and white livery used in the late 1990s to early 2000s. The No. 93 Viper won class at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Brickyard Grand Prix in July 2014, after both cars took podium positions in the previous races at The Glen and Mosport.\n\nIn March 2014, Chrysler announced that it was withdrawing the Vipers from the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref name=\"lm24\" /> The Vipers ended the season at [[Petit Le Mans]] with a team championship and driver's championship by Kuno Wittmer. Following the end of the 2014 season, Chrysler discontinued the factory program by SRT Motorsports.\n\n==== SRT Viper GT3-R ====\n[[File:Cameron Lawrence - Riley Viper - Daytona January 2015.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Riley Technologies|Riley Motorsports]] Dodge SRT Viper GT3-R being driven by Al Carter, [[Cameron Lawrence (racing driver)|Cameron Lawrence]], [[Dominik Farnbacher]] and Kuno Wittmer.]]\n\nThe Viper GT3-R was made available for race teams in the later half of 2013 at an estimated cost of $459,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/srt-viper-gt3-r/28007/|title=SRT releases $460,000 Viper GT3-R race car}}</ref> The car shares many technologies with the GTE race car but it is built to [[Group GT3]] regulations.\n\nThe GT3 car was jointly developed by SRT Motorsports and [[Riley Technologies]] and the car features the same 8.4 L engine from the road car and is capable of producing {{cvt|680|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} unrestricted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/viper-gt3r/|title=SRT Viper GT3-R}}</ref> However actual output will be near to {{cvt|600|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} due to balance of performance employed in GT3 championships.

the detainees profiled.\nAccording to the article, his transcript contained the following comment:\n\n{{quote|When I was in the Kandahar prison, the interrogator hit my arm and told me I received training in mortars. As he was hitting me, I kept telling him, \"No, I didn't receive training.\" I was crying and finally I told him I did receive the training. My hands were tied behind my back and my knees were on the ground and my head was bleeding. I was in a lot of pain, so I said I had the training. At that point, with all my suffering, if he had asked me if I was Osama bin Laden, I would have said yes\u2026. Am I an enemy of the United States? I never knew any Americans until I came to this prison. Americans should know who their real enemies are. What is my crime for being here for three years? That is all I would like to say.}}\n\n==Official status reviews==\n\nOriginally, the [[George W.

the detainees profiled.\nAccording to the article, his transcript contained the following comment:\n\n{{quote|When I was in the Kandahar prison, the interrogator hit my arm and told me I received training in mortars. As he was hitting me, I kept telling him, \"No, I didn't receive training.\" I was crying and finally I told him I did receive the training. My hands were tied behind my back and my knees were on the ground and my head was bleeding. I was in a lot of pain, so I said I had the training. At that point, with all my suffering, if he had asked me if I was Osama bin Laden, I would have said yes\u2026. Am I an enemy of the United States? I never knew any Americans until I came to this prison. Americans should know who their real enemies are. What is my crime for being here for three years? That is all I would like to say.}}\n\n==Official status reviews==\n\nOriginally, the [[George W.
