He held the posts of [[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] from 1948 to 1972 and [[President of North Korea|President]] from 1972 to 1994. He was also the [[leader of the Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as General Secretary after 1966). Coming to power after the end of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in 1945, he authorized the invasion of [[South Korea]] in 1950, triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the [[United Nations]] led by the [[United States]]. Following the military stalemate in the [[Korean War]], a ceasefire was signed on 27 July 1953. He was the third longest-serving non-royal head of state/government in the 20th century, in office for more than 45 years.\n\nUnder his leadership, North Korea was established as a [[communist state]] with a [[Economy of North Korea|publicly owned and planned economy]]. It had close political and economic relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. By the late 1950's and during the 1960's and 1970's, North Korea  enjoyed a higher standard of living than the South, which was [[History of South Korea#First Republic 1948\u20131960|suffering from political chaos and economic crises]]. The situation was reversed in the 1980's, as a newly stable South Korea became an economic powerhouse which was fueled by Japanese and American investment, military aid and internal economic development, while North Korea [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]] and then [[Economic collapse|declined]] during the same period. Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union, chief among them was Kim Il-sung's philosophy of ''[[Juche]]'', which focused on [[Korean nationalism]], [[Autarky|self-reliance]] and [[socialism]]. Despite this, the country received funds, subsidies and aid from the USSR (and the [[Eastern Bloc]]) until the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991. The resulting loss of economic aid adversely affected the North's economy, causing [[North Korean Famine|widespread famine]] in 1994.

This was the first of many \"nuclear crises\". On 19 May 1994, Kim ordered spent fuel to be unloaded from the already disputed nuclear research facility in [[Yongbyon nuclear facility|Yongbyon]]. Despite repeated chiding from Western nations, Kim continued to conduct [[North Korean nuclear program|nuclear research]] and carry on with the uranium enrichment program. In June 1994, former [[President of the United States|US president]] [[Jimmy Carter]] travelled to Pyongyang in an effort to persuade Kim to negotiate with the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] over its nuclear program.<ref>{{cite web| last=Blakemore| first=Erin| title=Bill Clinton Once Struck a Nuclear Deal With North Korea| website=history.com| url=https://www.history.com/news/north-korea-nuclear-deal-bill-clinton-agreed-framework| date=1 September 2018| publisher=A&E Television Networks| accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref> To the astonishment of the United States and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Kim agreed to halt his nuclear research program and seemed to be embarking upon a new opening to the West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422115356/http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron|url-status=dead|title=Chronology of U.S.-North Korean Nuclear and Missile Diplomacy &#124; Arms Control Association|archivedate=22 April 2012|website=www.armscontrol.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n\n{{Main|Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung}}\nOn the late morning of 8 July 1994, Kim Il-sung collapsed from a sudden [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his residence in [[Hyangsan County|Hyangsan]], [[North Pyongan Province|North Pyongyan]]. After the heart attack, Kim Jong-il ordered the team of doctors who were constantly at his father's side to leave, and arranged for the country's best doctors to be flown in from Pyongyang. After several hours, the doctors from Pyongyang arrived, but despite their efforts to save him, Kim Il-sung died later that day at the age of 82. After the traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian]] Mourning period, his death was declared thirty hours later.<ref>[[Barbara Demick|Demick, Barbara]]: ''Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea''.</ref>\n\nKim Il-sung's death resulted in nationwide mourning and a ten-day mourning period was declared by Kim Jong-il. His funeral in Pyongyang was attended by hundreds of thousands of people who were flown into the city from all over North Korea. Kim Il-sung's body was placed in a public [[mausoleum]] at the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun]], where his preserved and embalmed body lies under a glass coffin for viewing purposes. His head rests on a traditional Korean pillow and he is covered by the flag of the Workers' Party of Korea. Newsreel video of the funeral at Pyongyang was broadcast on several networks, and can now be found on various websites.<ref>{{YouTube|5zYsUqAYg6c|''Scenes of lamentation after Kim Il-sung\u2019s death''}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{see also|Kim dynasty (North Korea)}}\n\n[[File:Kim Jong-suk and Kim Jong-il.jpg|thumb|upright|Kim's first wife, Kim J\u014fng Suk, and his son, [[Kim Jong-il]]]]\n\nKim Il-sung married twice. His first wife, [[Kim Jong-suk]] (1919\u20131949), gave birth to two sons before her death in childbirth during the delivery of a stillborn girl. [[Kim Jong-il]] was his oldest son. The other son ([[Kim Man-il]], or Shura Kim) of this marriage died in 1947 in a swimming accident. Kim married [[Kim Sung-ae]] in 1952, and it is believed that he had three children with her: Kim Y\u014fng-il (not to be confused with the [[Kim Yong-il|former Premier of North Korea]] with the same name), Kim Ky\u014fng-il, and [[Kim Pyong-il]]. Kim Pyong-il was prominent in Korean politics until he became ambassador to [[Hungary]]. Since 2015, Kim Pyong-il has been ambassador to the [[Czech Republic]].

Korea|founder]] of [[North Korea]], which he ruled from the [[Day of the Foundation of the Republic (North Korea)|country's establishment]] in 1948 until his [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|death]] in 1994. He held the posts of [[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] from 1948 to 1972 and [[President of North Korea|President]] from 1972 to 1994. He was also the [[leader of the Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as General Secretary after 1966). Coming to power after the end of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in 1945, he authorized the invasion of [[South Korea]] in 1950, triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the [[United Nations]] led by the [[United States]]. Following the military stalemate in the [[Korean War]], a ceasefire was signed on 27 July 1953. He was the third longest-serving non-royal head of state/government in the 20th century, in office for more than 45 years.\n\nUnder his leadership, North Korea was established as a [[communist state]] with a [[Economy of North Korea|publicly owned and planned economy]]. It had close political and economic relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. By the late 1950's and during the 1960's and 1970's, North Korea  enjoyed a higher standard of living than the South, which was [[History of South Korea#First Republic 1948\u20131960|suffering from political chaos and economic crises]]. The situation was reversed in the 1980's, as a newly stable South Korea became an economic powerhouse which was fueled by Japanese and American investment, military aid and internal economic development, while North Korea [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]] and then [[Economic collapse|declined]] during the same period. Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union, chief among them was Kim Il-sung's philosophy of ''[[Juche]]'', which focused on [[Korean nationalism]], [[Autarky|self-reliance]] and [[socialism]]. Despite this, the country received funds, subsidies and aid from the USSR (and the [[Eastern Bloc]]) until the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991. The resulting loss of economic aid adversely affected the North's economy, causing [[North Korean Famine|widespread famine]] in 1994. During this period, North Korea also remained critical of the [[United States Forces Korea|United States defense force]]'s presence in the region, which it considered [[American imperialism|imperialist]], having seized the American ship [[USS Pueblo AGER-2|USS ''Pueblo'']] in 1968, which was part of an [[Korean DMZ Conflict|infiltration and subversion campaign]] to [[Korean reunification|reunify]] the [[Korean Peninsula|peninsula]] under North Korea's rule. He outlived [[Joseph Stalin]] by four decades and [[Mao Zedong]] by almost two and remained in power during the terms of office of six [[List of Presidents of South Korea#List of Presidents of the Republic of Korea|South Korean Presidents]], ten [[List of Presidents of the United States|US Presidents]] and the rule of [[United Kingdom|British]] monarchs [[George VI]] and later his daughter [[Elizabeth II]]. Known as the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]] (''Suryong''), he established a [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|personality cult]] which dominates [[Politics of North Korea|domestic politics in North Korea]].\n\nAt the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|6th WPK Congress]] in 1980, his oldest son [[Kim Jong-il]] was elected to be a [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] member and chosen to be his [[heir apparent]] to the supreme leadership. Kim Il-sung's birthday is a [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday in North Korea]] called the \"[[Day of the Sun]]\". In 1998, Kim Il-sung was declared \"[[Eternal leaders of North Korea|eternal President of the Republic]]\".\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Controversy about origins ===\n\nControversy surrounds Kim's life before the founding of North Korea, with some labeling him an impostor.

Thus I was called by three names, Song Ju, Han Byol and Il Sung. ... I did not like to be called by another name. Still less did I tolerate the people extolling me by comparing me to a star or the sun; it did not befit me, [as a] young man.

Until that time most of my acquaintances had called me by my real name, Song Ju. It was in later years when I started the armed struggle in east Manchuria that I was called by one name, Kim Il Sung, by my comrades.

These camps or ''[[Kwalliso|kwanliso]]'', a part of Kim's vast network of abusive [[Prisons in North Korea|penal and forced labor institutions]], were fenced and heavily guarded colonies in mountainous areas of the country, where prisoners were forced to perform back-breaking labor such as logging, mining, and picking crops. Most prisoners were held in these camps for life, and their living and working conditions in them were often deadly. For example, prisoners were nearly starved to death, denied medical care, denied proper housing and clothes, subjected to sexual violence, regularly mistreated, [[torture]]d and executed by guards.<ref name=Kim-IlSungLegacy />\n\n=== Later rule ===\n[[File:CeausescuKim1971.jpg|thumb|right|Kim greets visiting Romanian President [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] in Pyongyang, 1971]]\n\nDespite his opposition to de-Stalinization, Kim never officially severed relations with the Soviet Union, and he did not take part in the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet Split]]. After Khrushchev was replaced by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1964, Kim's relations with the Soviet Union became closer. At the same time, Kim was increasingly alienated by Mao's unstable style of leadership, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the late 1960s.

As a result, [[Foreign relations of North Korea#Albania|relations between North Korea and Albania]] would remain cold and tense right up until Hoxha's death in 1985.

Kim Il-Sung planned these operations to seize persons who could be used to support North Korea's overseas intelligence operations, or those who had technical skills to maintain the socialist state's economic infrastructure in farms, construction, hospitals, and heavy industry. According to the Korean War Abductees Family Union (KWAFU), those abducted by North Korea after the war included 2,919 civil servants, 1,613 police, 190 judicial officers and lawyers, and 424 medical practitioners. In the [[Korean Air Lines YS-11 hijacking|hijacking and seizure of Korean Airlines flight YS-11 in 1969]] by North Korean agents, the pilots and mechanics, and others with specialized skills, were the only ones never permitted to return to South Korea. The total number of foreign abductees and disappeared is still unknown, but is estimated to include more than 200,000 people. The vast majority of disappearances occurred or were linked to the Korean War, but hundreds of South Koreans and Japanese people were abducted during the 1960s and 1980s. A number of South Koreans and nationals of the People's Republic of China have also been apparently abducted in the 2000s and 2010s.

Founded in 1956, BCS has played an important role in educating and nurturing IT professionals, computer scientists, computer engineers, upholding the profession, accrediting chartered IT professional status, and creating a global community active in promoting and furthering the field and practice of computing.\n\n== Overview ==\nWith a worldwide membership of over 68,000 members in over 150 countries, BCS is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] and was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1984. Its objectives are to promote the study and application of communications technology and computing technology and to advance knowledge of education in ICT for the benefit of professional practitioners and the general public.\n\nBCS is a member institution of [[Engineering Council]], through which it is licensed to award the designation of [[Incorporated Engineer]] and [[Chartered Engineer]] and therefore is responsible for the regulation of ICT and computer science fields within the UK. The BCS is also a member of the [[CEPIS|Council of European Professional Informatics Societies]] (CEPIS) and the [[Seoul Accord]] for international tertiary degree recognition. BCS was previously a member organisation of the [[Science Council]] through which it was licensed to award the designation of [[Chartered Scientist]].\n\nBCS has offices off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], south of [[Covent Garden]] in central [[London]]. The main administrative offices are in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], west of London. It also has two overseas offices in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Mauritius]].\n\nMembers are sent the quarterly IT professional magazine ''[[ITNOW]]'' (formerly ''The Computer Bulletin'').\n\nBCS is a member organization of the [[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations]] (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[Enterprise Architecture]].\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of BCS was the \"London Computer Group\" (LCG), founded in 1956. BCS was formed a year later from the merger of the LCG and an unincorporated association of scientists into an unincorporated club. In October 1957, BCS was incorporated, by [[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]], as \"The British Computer Society Ltd\": the first President of BCS was Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]] (1913\u20132010), [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]].\n\nIn 1966, the BCS was granted charitable status and in 1970, the BCS was given [[Coat of arms|Armorial Bearings]] including the shield and crest.\nThe major ethical responsibilities of BCS are emphasized by the leopard's face, surmounting the whole crest and depicting eternal vigilance over the integrity of the Society and its members.\n\nThe BCS patron is [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]], [[Order of the Garter|KG]]. He became patron in December 1976 and has been actively involved in BCS activities, particularly having been President in the [[Silver Jubilee]] Year in 1982\u20131983.\n\nIn 2007, BCS launched ''BCSrecruit.com'' \u2013 a job site specifically aimed at IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221102542/http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archivedate=21 December 2013 |title=British Computer Society launches BCSrecruit.com jobs board |website=PublicTechnology.net |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> In 2008 the BCS was labelled \"irrelevant\" by an IT training company, in connection with claims it made that nine out of ten IT professionals were \"unaware\" of the BCS's Chartered accreditation scheme.<ref name=\"v3 williams 2008\">{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=BCS slammed as 'outdated' and 'irrelevant'|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1941031/bcs-slammed-outdated-irrelevant|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=[[v3.co.uk]]|date=28 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2009, the British Computer Society went through a transformation and re-branded itself as \"BCS \u2013 The Chartered Institute for IT\".<ref name=\"rebrand\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/1828171/bcs-the-chartered-institute-it |title= BCS becomes The Chartered Institute for IT |first=Dave |last=Bailey |date=21 September 2009 |publisher=British Computer Society |journal=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> In 2010, an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] was called to discuss the direction of the BCS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |title=BCS \u2013 Building for your Future |publisher=British Computer Society |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528093404/http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |archivedate=28 May 2010 }}</ref> The debate has been covered by the computing press.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill |last=Goodwin |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/read-all-about-it/2010/04/the-egm-debate-bcs-v-len-keigh.html |title=The EGM debate: BCS v Len Keighley |publisher=[[Computer Weekly]] |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Maxwell |last=Cooter |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |title=BCS membership fights over direction |journal=[[Network World]] |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607071255/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Phipps |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?blogid=41&entryid=3026 |title=BCS EGM: It's Time To Vote For Transparency |journal=[[Computerworld]] UK |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Oates |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/21/bcs_rebel/ |title=BCS trustee threatens rebels with libel action |work=[[The Register]] |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nBCS is governed by a [[Trustee]] Board comprising the President, the Deputy President, the immediate past President, up to nine Vice Presidents (including Vice-President Finance), and five Professional Members elected by the Advisory Council.<ref name=\"Boards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/13817 |title=Boards and Committees |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]], Professor of Computer Science at Cambridge University, served as its first president.

Normally these should appear after decorations, degrees and chartered letters. Members holding CEng should also display the designatory letters of the institution through which they are registered immediately after the CEng. Conventionally, members holding Chartered status ([[Chartered IT Professional|CITP]]) display this immediately after their membership letters (e.g., FBCS CITP or MBCS CITP).

is a [[professional body]] and a [[learned society]] that represents those working in [[information technology]] (IT) and [[computer science]], both in the [[United Kingdom]] and internationally. Founded in 1956, BCS has played an important role in educating and nurturing IT professionals, computer scientists, computer engineers, upholding the profession, accrediting chartered IT professional status, and creating a global community active in promoting and furthering the field and practice of computing.\n\n== Overview ==\nWith a worldwide membership of over 68,000 members in over 150 countries, BCS is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] and was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1984. Its objectives are to promote the study and application of communications technology and computing technology and to advance knowledge of education in ICT for the benefit of professional practitioners and the general public.\n\nBCS is a member institution of [[Engineering Council]], through which it is licensed to award the designation of [[Incorporated Engineer]] and [[Chartered Engineer]] and therefore is responsible for the regulation of ICT and computer science fields within the UK. The BCS is also a member of the [[CEPIS|Council of European Professional Informatics Societies]] (CEPIS) and the [[Seoul Accord]] for international tertiary degree recognition. BCS was previously a member organisation of the [[Science Council]] through which it was licensed to award the designation of [[Chartered Scientist]].\n\nBCS has offices off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], south of [[Covent Garden]] in central [[London]]. The main administrative offices are in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], west of London. It also has two overseas offices in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Mauritius]].\n\nMembers are sent the quarterly IT professional magazine ''[[ITNOW]]'' (formerly ''The Computer Bulletin'').\n\nBCS is a member organization of the [[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations]] (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[Enterprise Architecture]].\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of BCS was the \"London Computer Group\" (LCG), founded in 1956. BCS was formed a year later from the merger of the LCG and an unincorporated association of scientists into an unincorporated club. In October 1957, BCS was incorporated, by [[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]], as \"The British Computer Society Ltd\": the first President of BCS was Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]] (1913\u20132010), [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]].\n\nIn 1966, the BCS was granted charitable status and in 1970, the BCS was given [[Coat of arms|Armorial Bearings]] including the shield and crest.\nThe major ethical responsibilities of BCS are emphasized by the leopard's face, surmounting the whole crest and depicting eternal vigilance over the integrity of the Society and its members.\n\nThe BCS patron is [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]], [[Order of the Garter|KG]]. He became patron in December 1976 and has been actively involved in BCS activities, particularly having been President in the [[Silver Jubilee]] Year in 1982\u20131983.\n\nIn 2007, BCS launched ''BCSrecruit.com'' \u2013 a job site specifically aimed at IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221102542/http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archivedate=21 December 2013 |title=British Computer Society launches BCSrecruit.com jobs board |website=PublicTechnology.net |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> In 2008 the BCS was labelled \"irrelevant\" by an IT training company, in connection with claims it made that nine out of ten IT professionals were \"unaware\" of the BCS's Chartered accreditation scheme.<ref name=\"v3 williams 2008\">{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=BCS slammed as 'outdated' and 'irrelevant'|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1941031/bcs-slammed-outdated-irrelevant|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=[[v3.co.uk]]|date=28 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2009, the British Computer Society went through a transformation and re-branded itself as \"BCS \u2013 The Chartered Institute for IT\".<ref name=\"rebrand\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/1828171/bcs-the-chartered-institute-it |title= BCS becomes The Chartered Institute for IT |first=Dave |last=Bailey |date=21 September 2009 |publisher=British Computer Society |journal=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> In 2010, an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] was called to discuss the direction of the BCS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |title=BCS \u2013 Building for your Future |publisher=British Computer Society |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528093404/http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |archivedate=28 May 2010 }}</ref> The debate has been covered by the computing press.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill |last=Goodwin |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/read-all-about-it/2010/04/the-egm-debate-bcs-v-len-keigh.html |title=The EGM debate: BCS v Len Keighley |publisher=[[Computer Weekly]] |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Maxwell |last=Cooter |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |title=BCS membership fights over direction |journal=[[Network World]] |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607071255/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Phipps |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?blogid=41&entryid=3026 |title=BCS EGM: It's Time To Vote For Transparency |journal=[[Computerworld]] UK |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Oates |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/21/bcs_rebel/ |title=BCS trustee threatens rebels with libel action |work=[[The Register]] |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nBCS is governed by a [[Trustee]] Board comprising the President, the Deputy President, the immediate past President, up to nine Vice Presidents (including Vice-President Finance), and five Professional Members elected by the Advisory Council.<ref name=\"Boards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/13817 |title=Boards and Committees |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]], Professor of Computer Science at Cambridge University, served as its first president.

The order of designatory (post-nominal) letters is complex and open to a certain amount of interpretation. The accepted authority on this subject is ''Debrett\u2019s Correct Form''. Normally these should appear after decorations, degrees and chartered letters. Members holding CEng should also display the designatory letters of the institution through which they are registered immediately after the CEng. Conventionally, members holding Chartered status ([[Chartered IT Professional|CITP]]) display this immediately after their membership letters (e.g., FBCS CITP or MBCS CITP). However, as CITP may now be awarded by other organisations it may also be displayed separately, following that of the awarding institution.\n\nSome examples of BCS-related post-nominals:\n\n* Mr Frank James [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], FBCS.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Master of Science|MSc]], [[CEng]], MBCS, MIET.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] ([[Honours degree|Hons]]), MBCS, CITP.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, MSc, [[Chartered Scientist|CSci]], MIET, CITP.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Master of Science|MSc]], MCGI, [[CEng]], MBCS, FEDIPAdvPra.\n\n==Awards==\nThe society provides several awards to recognize outstanding computer scientists, engineers, experienced and young IT professionals.\nThe awards include:\n\n* [[Lovelace Medal]]\n* [[Roger Needham Award]]\n* Early Career Award\n* John Perry Prize\n* Distinguished Dissertation Award\n* UK Industry Award\n\n==Qualifications==\nBCS provides a range of qualifications both for users of computers and [[Information technology|IT]] professionals.\n\n===BCS IT User Qualifications===\nBCS offers qualifications that cover all areas of IT, including understanding Spreadsheets and Presentation Software, Animation, Video Editing and Social Networking safety.<ref>IT User Qualifications: http://www.bcs.org/category/14405</ref>\n\nThe current IT user qualifications are:\n\n[[File:ECDL ft rgb2.jpg|200px|right]]\n*[[European Computer Driving Licence]] (ECDL) - BCS is the only organisation licensed to offer ECDL qualifications in the UK.\n*[[European Computer Driving Licence#ECDL Advanced|Advanced ECDL]] - the advanced course of ECDL (\"Advanced ECDL\") has four sections, each a qualification in its own right.
