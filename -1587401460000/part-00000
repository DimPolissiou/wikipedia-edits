In the film, [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] is stolen by a toy collector, prompting [[Buzz Lightyear]] and his friends to rescue him, but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum. [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R.

The returning cast is joined by [[Joan Cusack]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Estelle Harris]], [[Jodi Benson]], and [[Wayne Knight]], who voice the new characters introduced in this film.\n\nDisney initially envisioned ''Toy Story 2'' as a [[direct-to-video]] sequel. The film began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to a theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for ''Toy Story 2'' was compressed into nine months.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /><ref name=\"iwerks\" />\n\nDespite production struggles, ''Toy Story 2'' opened on November 24, 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $497 million. It received critical acclaim, with a&nbsp;rare [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% rating]]&nbsp;on the website&nbsp;[[Rotten Tomatoes]], like its predecessor.<ref>{{Citation|title=Toy Story 2|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_2/|language=en|accessdate=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601142622/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_2|archive-date=June 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It is considered by critics to be one of few sequel films superior to the original<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\" /> and is frequently featured on [[List of films considered the best|lists of the greatest animated films ever made]]. Among its accolades, the film won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] at the [[57th Golden Globe Awards]]. The film has received praise for its animation, humor, heartfelt story, musical score, and vocal performances. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. Two sequels, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', were released on June 18, 2010 and June 21, 2019, respectively, and they were also critical and commercial successes.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Keep the summary short please.-->\nAndy prepares to go to cowboy camp with [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], but while playing with Woody and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], he accidentally tears Woody's arm. Andy's mother puts Woody on a shelf, and Andy leaves without him. After having a nightmare about Andy throwing him away in a trashcan, Woody finds a squeeze toy penguin named [[Wheezy]], who has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale. Woody rescues him, but is stolen by a greedy toy collector named [[Al McWhiggin]]. Buzz, [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]], [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog]], and [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]] set out on a mission to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody learns he is based on ''Woody's Roundup'', and along with [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], [[Bullseye (Toy Story)|Bullseye]], and [[Stinky Pete the Prospector]] (the other people in his show), he is set to be sold to a museum in Japan, but Woody intends to return to Andy, earning him Jessie's ire. Stinky Pete explains the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage, which triggers Jessie's claustrophobia.\n\nAl accidentally rips Woody's arm off completely while planning a photograph of the Roundup gang, so he calls a toy cleaner to come the next morning to try and fix him. That night while Al is sleeping, Woody attempts to retrieve his arm and escape, but his escape is sabotaged when Al's television turns on, waking up Al in the process, and he angrily blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next day, the toy cleaner arrives and fixes Woody's arm. Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a girl named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns Woody the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he would last forever in the museum. Hearing this and believing that Andy would not play with him anymore if he ever ripped his arm again, Woody decides to stay, much to the delight of the others. Meanwhile, Buzz and the others reach Al's Toy Barn, where they are given a tour by a [[Barbie]] doll and Buzz is imprisoned in a cardboard box by a [[List of Toy Story characters#Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear|Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear action figure]] with Buzz's original space ranger persona, believing Buzz is a rogue space ranger. Utility Belt Buzz then joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After discovering Al's plan, they head for his apartment. Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, but inadvertently frees an [[Evil Emperor Zurg]] action figure, who follows Buzz with the intent of destroying him. The toys find Woody and Buzz rejoins them after revealing the mix up with Utility Belt Buzz to the other toys. Buzz tells Woody that they need to return home, but he refuses to go back, unwilling to abandon the Roundup gang and be eventually outgrown or rejected by Andy.\n\nBuzz reminds Woody a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy hug him on TV, Woody realizes Buzz is right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and the other toys. However, Stinky Pete refuses and reveals he was actually responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt by turning on the TV, and framed Jessie for it, as he wants to go to the museum having never been sold to children, loved, or played with. Al then returns, puts the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport. Andy's toys pursue Al, but are caught by Zurg, who battles New Buzz and reveals himself to be his father, until Rex comes in and inadvertently knocks Zurg off the elevator. New Buzz chooses to remain behind with Zurg, while Andy's toys, accompanied by [[List of Toy Story characters#Aliens / Little Green Men|three toy Aliens]], steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to the airport, where they sneak into the baggage handling system and find Al's suitcase. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm with his pickaxe, but Andy's toys subdue him and place him inside a little girl's backpack and he goes home with her. They free Bullseye, but Jessie ends up on the plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody enters the plane and frees Jessie, allowing them to escape before it takes off. The toys then use a baggage carrier to return home. Andy returns from camp and accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, then repairs Woody's arm, while Wheezy's squeaker has been fixed as well. Meanwhile, Al is upset in a new commercial after losing the Roundup gang. Woody tells Buzz he is no longer worried about Andy outgrowing him because they will still have each other for company.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = Many of the original cast, including [[Tom Hanks]] ''(top)'' and [[Tim Allen]], reprise their roles from ''Toy Story''.\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\n| width1    = 130\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Tim Allen cropped.jpg\n| width2    = 130\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n}}\n\n{{See also|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]] and [[List of Toy Story characters#Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear|Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear]]\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]]\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as [[Stinky Pete the Prospector]]\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]]\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]]\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]]\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]]\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Al McWhiggin]]\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]]\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[Andy's Mom]]\n* [[R.

Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel.<ref name=\"PixarTouch01\" /> Disney had recently begun making [[direct-to-video]] sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the ''Toy Story'' sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' sequel, ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', had returned an estimated $100&nbsp;million in profits.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=175}}</ref>\n\nInitially, everything regarding the sequel was uncertain at first: whether stars [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]] would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at [[Pixar]] or traditionally [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn]] at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]].<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects ([[Andrew Stanton]] as co-director in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and [[Pete Docter]] as director of what would eventually become ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''). Instead, Lasseter turned to [[Ash Brannon]], a young directing animator on ''[[Toy Story]]'' whose work he admired. Brannon, a [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] graduate, joined the ''Toy Story'' team in 1993.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\" />\n\n=== Story ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:40em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\"The story of ''Toy Story 2'' is based a lot on my own experience. I'm a big toy collector and a lot of them are like antiques, or one-of-a-kind toys, or prototypes the toy makers have given me. Well, I have five sons, and when they were little and they loved to come to daddy's work, and come in into daddy's office and they just want to touch and play with everything. And I was sitting there saying 'Oh no, that's uh, you can't play with that one, oh no, play with this one, oh no....' and I found myself just sitting there looking at myself and laughing. Because toys are manufactured, put on this Earth, to be played with by a child. That is the core essence of ''Toy Story''. And so I started wondering, what was it like from a toy's point of view to be collected?\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\u2014Director [[John Lasseter]]<ref name=MakingTS2 />\n|}\nLasseter's intention with a sequel was to respect the original film and create that world again.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=176}}</ref> The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. The obsessive toy collector named [[Al McWhiggin#Al McWhiggin|Al McWhiggin]], who had appeared in a draft of ''Toy Story'' but was later expunged, was inserted into the film.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.<ref name=MakingTS2>''The Making of Toy Story 2'', Disc 2, ''Toy Story 2'' 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, 2005</ref>\n\nSecondary characters in Woody's set were inspired by 1940s\u20131950s Western and puppet shows for children, such as ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'' and ''[[Howdy Doody]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /><ref name=\"Western\">{{harvnb|Nelson|2015|page=197}}</ref> The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter's wife Nancy, who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /> The scope for the original ''Toy Story'' was basic and only extended over two residential homes, roadways, and a chain restaurant, whereas ''Toy Story 2'' has been described by Unkrich as something \"all over the map\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\" />\n\nTo make the project ready for theaters, Lasseter would need to add 12 minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since it could not be mere padding\u2014it would have to feel as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, [[Joe Ranft]], and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. There, he hosted what he called a \"story summit\", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.\n\nBack at the office that Monday, Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of ''Toy Story 2'' from exposition to resolution.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first ''Toy Story''. The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=181}}</ref> A deleted scene from ''Toy Story'', featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody's fear of losing Andy. The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of ''Toy Story''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\" />\n\n=== Animation ===\nAs the story approached the production stage in early 1997, it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on ''A Bug's Life'' for a 1998 release. The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful [[CD-ROM]] titles the previous year \u2013 ''[[Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story]]'' and ''The Toy Story Activity Center''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /> Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in ''Toy Story'' itself. [[Steve Jobs]] made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the ''Toy Story 2'' production team.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=177}}</ref>\n\nBefore the switch from direct-to-video to feature film, the ''Toy Story 2'' crew had been on its own, placed in a new building that was well-separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks. \"We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox,\" co-producer Karen Jackson said.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=180}}</ref> Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. The film reused digital elements from ''Toy Story'' but, true to the company's \"prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of ''Toy Story'' than might be expected\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=182}}</ref> Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short ''[[Geri's Game]]'', who became the Cleaner in ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\" /> Supervising animator [[Glenn McQueen]] inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nWhile producing ''Toy Story'', the crew was careful in creating new locations, working within available technology at that time. By the time of production on ''Toy Story 2'', technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> In making the sequel, the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film's look, but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed.<ref name=\"AWN\" /> To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf, the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust, an incredibly difficult task. After much experimentation, a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf. Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film.<ref name=\"Lasseter\">{{cite video | people=Lasseter, John|year=2010|title=''Toy Story 2'' commentary| medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=Buena Vista Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n=== Controversy and troubled production ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When we went from a direct-to-video to a feature film and we had limited time in which to finish that feature film, the pressure really amped up. Forget seeing your family, forget doing anything. Once we made that decision [on the schedule], it was like, 'Okay, you have a release date. You're ''going'' to make that release date. You're ''going'' to make these screenings.'\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2013 Karen Jackson, co-producer of ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\" />\n|}\nDisney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer, and Pixar complied. As a result, Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin, associate producers, moved up into the roles of co-producers.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=178}}</ref> Lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with ''A Bug's Life'' until it wrapped in the fall. Once available, he took over directing duties and added [[Lee Unkrich]] as co-director. Unkrich, also fresh from supervising editor duties on ''A Bug's Life'', would focus on layout and [[cinematography]], while Brannon would be credited as co-director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" />\n\nIn November 1997, Disney executives Roth and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] viewed the film's story reels, with some finished animation, in a screening room at Pixar. They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing ''Toy Story 2'' in theaters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\" /> In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew. After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for ''Toy Story 2'' would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal\u2014but ''Toy Story 2'' would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe work done on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of the animators, while routinely clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the [[Root directory|root folder]] of the ''Toy Story 2'' assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacob was one of the first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pixars-billiondollar-delete-button-nearly-lost-toy-story-2-animation-7758083.html | title = Pixar's billion-dollar delete button nearly lost Toy Story 2 animation | first = Gilliar | last = Orr | date = May 17, 2012 | accessdate = September 14, 2015 | work = [[The Independent]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181119174902/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pixars-billion-dollar-delete-button-nearly-lost-toy-story-2-animation-7758083.html | archive-date = November 19, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/|title=How ''Toy Story 2'' Got Deleted Twice, Once on Accident and Again for Its Own Good|date=May 21, 2014|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121130635/https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/|archive-date=November 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Upon returning from the European promotion of ''A Bug's Life'', Lasseter watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.<ref name=\"iwerks\">{{Cite video | people = Iwerks, Leslie | title = [[The Pixar Story]] | medium = Documentary | publisher=Leslie Iwerks Productions |year = 2007 }}</ref> Unkrich, concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining, asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back. Jobs explained that there was no choice, presumably in reference to the film's licensees and marketing partners, who were getting toys and promotions ready.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" />\n\nBrannon focused on development, story and animation, Lasseter was in charge of art, modeling and lighting, and Unkrich oversaw editorial and layout. Since they met daily to discuss their progress with each other (they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in the same direction), the boundaries of their responsibilities overlapped.<ref name=\"AWN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/toy-story-2-not-your-typical-hollywood-sequel|title=''Toy Story 2'' Is Not Your Typical Hollywood Sequel|author=Karl Cohen|date=December 1, 1999|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q1x6lkX?url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/toy-story-2-not-your-typical-hollywood-sequel|archive-date=May 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As was common with Pixar features, the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer.

In the film, [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] is stolen by a toy collector, prompting [[Buzz Lightyear]] and his friends to rescue him, but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum. [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R.

The returning cast is joined by [[Joan Cusack]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Estelle Harris]], [[Jodi Benson]], and [[Wayne Knight]], who voice the new characters introduced in this film.\n\nDisney initially envisioned ''Toy Story 2'' as a [[direct-to-video]] sequel. The film began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to a theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for ''Toy Story 2'' was compressed into nine months.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /><ref name=\"iwerks\" />\n\nDespite production struggles, ''Toy Story 2'' opened on November 24, 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $497 million.

Among its accolades, the film won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] at the [[57th Golden Globe Awards]]. The film has received praise for its animation, humor, heartfelt story, musical score, and vocal performances. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. Two sequels, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', were released on June 18, 2010 and June 21, 2019, respectively, and they were also critical and commercial successes.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Keep the summary short please.-->\nAndy prepares to go to cowboy camp with [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], but while playing with Woody and [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]], he accidentally tears Woody's arm. Andy's mother puts Woody on a shelf, and Andy leaves without him. After having a nightmare about Andy throwing him away in a trashcan, Woody finds a squeeze toy penguin named [[Wheezy]], who has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale. Woody rescues him, but is stolen by a greedy toy collector named [[Al McWhiggin]]. Buzz, [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]], [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog]], and [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]] set out on a mission to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody learns he is based on ''Woody's Roundup'', and along with [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], [[Bullseye (Toy Story)|Bullseye]], and [[Stinky Pete the Prospector]] (the other people in his show), he is set to be sold to a museum in Japan, but Woody intends to return to Andy, earning him Jessie's ire. Stinky Pete explains the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage, which triggers Jessie's claustrophobia.\n\nAl accidentally rips Woody's arm off completely while planning a photograph of the Roundup gang, so he calls a toy cleaner to come the next morning to try and fix him. That night while Al is sleeping, Woody attempts to retrieve his arm and escape, but his escape is sabotaged when Al's television turns on, waking up Al in the process, and he angrily blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next day, the toy cleaner arrives and fixes Woody's arm. Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a girl named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns Woody the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he would last forever in the museum. Hearing this and believing that Andy would not play with him anymore if he ever ripped his arm again, Woody decides to stay, much to the delight of the others. Meanwhile, Buzz and the others reach Al's Toy Barn, where they are given a tour by a [[Barbie]] doll and Buzz is imprisoned in a cardboard box by a [[List of Toy Story characters#Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear|Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear action figure]] with Buzz's original space ranger persona, believing Buzz is a rogue space ranger. Utility Belt Buzz then joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After discovering Al's plan, they head for his apartment. Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, but inadvertently frees an [[Evil Emperor Zurg]] action figure, who follows Buzz with the intent of destroying him. The toys find Woody and Buzz rejoins them after revealing the mix up with Utility Belt Buzz to the other toys. Buzz tells Woody that they need to return home, but he refuses to go back, unwilling to abandon the Roundup gang and be eventually outgrown or rejected by Andy.\n\nBuzz reminds Woody a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy hug him on TV, Woody realizes Buzz is right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and the other toys. However, Stinky Pete refuses and reveals he was actually responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt by turning on the TV, and framed Jessie for it, as he wants to go to the museum having never been sold to children, loved, or played with. Al then returns, puts the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport. Andy's toys pursue Al, but are caught by Zurg, who battles New Buzz and reveals himself to be his father, until Rex comes in and inadvertently knocks Zurg off the elevator. New Buzz chooses to remain behind with Zurg, while Andy's toys, accompanied by [[List of Toy Story characters#Aliens / Little Green Men|three toy Aliens]], steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to the airport, where they sneak into the baggage handling system and find Al's suitcase. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm with his pickaxe, but Andy's toys subdue him and place him inside a little girl's backpack and he goes home with her. They free Bullseye, but Jessie ends up on the plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody enters the plane and frees Jessie, allowing them to escape before it takes off. The toys then use a baggage carrier to return home. Andy returns from camp and accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, then repairs Woody's arm, while Wheezy's squeaker has been fixed as well. Meanwhile, Al is upset in a new commercial after losing the Roundup gang. Woody tells Buzz he is no longer worried about Andy outgrowing him because they will still have each other for company.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = Many of the original cast, including [[Tom Hanks]] ''(top)'' and [[Tim Allen]], reprise their roles from ''Toy Story''.\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\n| width1    = 130\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Tim Allen cropped.jpg\n| width2    = 130\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n}}\n\n{{See also|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]] and [[List of Toy Story characters#Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear|Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear]]\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]]\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as [[Stinky Pete the Prospector]]\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]]\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]]\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]]\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]]\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Al McWhiggin]]\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]]\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[Andy's Mom]]\n* [[R.

Lasseter described how the boy's excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply. Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. The memory was a defining factor in the production of ''Toy Story 2'', with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.<ref name=\"dvdint1\">{{cite video| people = Lasseter, John; Unkrich, Lee; Brannon, Ash| title =Toy Story 2.

Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel.<ref name=\"PixarTouch01\" /> Disney had recently begun making [[direct-to-video]] sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the ''Toy Story'' sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' sequel, ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', had returned an estimated $100&nbsp;million in profits.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=175}}</ref>\n\nInitially, everything regarding the sequel was uncertain at first: whether stars [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]] would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at [[Pixar]] or traditionally [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn]] at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]].<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects ([[Andrew Stanton]] as co-director in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and [[Pete Docter]] as director of what would eventually become ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''). Instead, Lasseter turned to [[Ash Brannon]], a young directing animator on ''[[Toy Story]]'' whose work he admired. Brannon, a [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] graduate, joined the ''Toy Story'' team in 1993.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\" />\n\n=== Story ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:40em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\"The story of ''Toy Story 2'' is based a lot on my own experience. I'm a big toy collector and a lot of them are like antiques, or one-of-a-kind toys, or prototypes the toy makers have given me. Well, I have five sons, and when they were little and they loved to come to daddy's work, and come in into daddy's office and they just want to touch and play with everything. And I was sitting there saying 'Oh no, that's uh, you can't play with that one, oh no, play with this one, oh no....' and I found myself just sitting there looking at myself and laughing. Because toys are manufactured, put on this Earth, to be played with by a child. That is the core essence of ''Toy Story''. And so I started wondering, what was it like from a toy's point of view to be collected?\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\u2014Director [[John Lasseter]]<ref name=MakingTS2 />\n|}\nLasseter's intention with a sequel was to respect the original film and create that world again.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=176}}</ref> The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. The obsessive toy collector named [[Al McWhiggin#Al McWhiggin|Al McWhiggin]], who had appeared in a draft of ''Toy Story'' but was later expunged, was inserted into the film.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.<ref name=MakingTS2>''The Making of Toy Story 2'', Disc 2, ''Toy Story 2'' 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, 2005</ref>\n\nSecondary characters in Woody's set were inspired by 1940s\u20131950s Western and puppet shows for children, such as ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'' and ''[[Howdy Doody]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /><ref name=\"Western\">{{harvnb|Nelson|2015|page=197}}</ref> The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter's wife Nancy, who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /> The scope for the original ''Toy Story'' was basic and only extended over two residential homes, roadways, and a chain restaurant, whereas ''Toy Story 2'' has been described by Unkrich as something \"all over the map\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\" />\n\nTo make the project ready for theaters, Lasseter would need to add 12 minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since it could not be mere padding\u2014it would have to feel as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, [[Joe Ranft]], and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. There, he hosted what he called a \"story summit\", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.\n\nBack at the office that Monday, Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of ''Toy Story 2'' from exposition to resolution.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first ''Toy Story''. The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=181}}</ref> A deleted scene from ''Toy Story'', featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody's fear of losing Andy. The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of ''Toy Story''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\" />\n\n=== Animation ===\nAs the story approached the production stage in early 1997, it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on ''A Bug's Life'' for a 1998 release. The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful [[CD-ROM]] titles the previous year \u2013 ''[[Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story]]'' and ''The Toy Story Activity Center''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /> Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in ''Toy Story'' itself. [[Steve Jobs]] made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the ''Toy Story 2'' production team.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=177}}</ref>\n\nBefore the switch from direct-to-video to feature film, the ''Toy Story 2'' crew had been on its own, placed in a new building that was well-separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks. \"We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox,\" co-producer Karen Jackson said.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=180}}</ref> Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. The film reused digital elements from ''Toy Story'' but, true to the company's \"prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of ''Toy Story'' than might be expected\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=182}}</ref> Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short ''[[Geri's Game]]'', who became the Cleaner in ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\" /> Supervising animator [[Glenn McQueen]] inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nWhile producing ''Toy Story'', the crew was careful in creating new locations, working within available technology at that time. By the time of production on ''Toy Story 2'', technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> In making the sequel, the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film's look, but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed.<ref name=\"AWN\" /> To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf, the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust, an incredibly difficult task. After much experimentation, a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf. Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film.<ref name=\"Lasseter\">{{cite video | people=Lasseter, John|year=2010|title=''Toy Story 2'' commentary| medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=Buena Vista Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n=== Controversy and troubled production ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When we went from a direct-to-video to a feature film and we had limited time in which to finish that feature film, the pressure really amped up. Forget seeing your family, forget doing anything. Once we made that decision [on the schedule], it was like, 'Okay, you have a release date. You're ''going'' to make that release date. You're ''going'' to make these screenings.'\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2013 Karen Jackson, co-producer of ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\" />\n|}\nDisney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer, and Pixar complied. As a result, Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin, associate producers, moved up into the roles of co-producers.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=178}}</ref> Lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with ''A Bug's Life'' until it wrapped in the fall. Once available, he took over directing duties and added [[Lee Unkrich]] as co-director. Unkrich, also fresh from supervising editor duties on ''A Bug's Life'', would focus on layout and [[cinematography]], while Brannon would be credited as co-director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" />\n\nIn November 1997, Disney executives Roth and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] viewed the film's story reels, with some finished animation, in a screening room at Pixar. They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing ''Toy Story 2'' in theaters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\" /> In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew. After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for ''Toy Story 2'' would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal\u2014but ''Toy Story 2'' would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe work done on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of the animators, while routinely clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the [[Root directory|root folder]] of the ''Toy Story 2'' assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacob was one of the first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pixars-billiondollar-delete-button-nearly-lost-toy-story-2-animation-7758083.html | title = Pixar's billion-dollar delete button nearly lost Toy Story 2 animation | first = Gilliar | last = Orr | date = May 17, 2012 | accessdate = September 14, 2015 | work = [[The Independent]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181119174902/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pixars-billion-dollar-delete-button-nearly-lost-toy-story-2-animation-7758083.html | archive-date = November 19, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/|title=How ''Toy Story 2'' Got Deleted Twice, Once on Accident and Again for Its Own Good|date=May 21, 2014|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121130635/https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/|archive-date=November 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Upon returning from the European promotion of ''A Bug's Life'', Lasseter watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.<ref name=\"iwerks\">{{Cite video | people = Iwerks, Leslie | title = [[The Pixar Story]] | medium = Documentary | publisher=Leslie Iwerks Productions |year = 2007 }}</ref> Unkrich, concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining, asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back. Jobs explained that there was no choice, presumably in reference to the film's licensees and marketing partners, who were getting toys and promotions ready.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" />\n\nBrannon focused on development, story and animation, Lasseter was in charge of art, modeling and lighting, and Unkrich oversaw editorial and layout. Since they met daily to discuss their progress with each other (they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in the same direction), the boundaries of their responsibilities overlapped.<ref name=\"AWN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/toy-story-2-not-your-typical-hollywood-sequel|title=''Toy Story 2'' Is Not Your Typical Hollywood Sequel|author=Karl Cohen|date=December 1, 1999|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q1x6lkX?url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/toy-story-2-not-your-typical-hollywood-sequel|archive-date=May 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As was common with Pixar features, the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer.

The scene in question, which featured the use of the word \"[[fuck]]\" multiple times, prompted a number of complaints from consumers, causing Costco to eventually recall the defective units from shelves and later go on to replace them.

During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, with the name ''Cusum'', and was included in the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia]].\n\nIn the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by [[Huns|Hunnic invasions]]. By the end of the same century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] had reconstructed the town and called it by the names ''Petrikon'' or ''Petrikov'' ({{lang-gr|\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd}}) after [[Saint Peter]]. [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes such as the [[Severians]], the [[Obotrites]] and the [[Serbs]] (including the subtribes of the [[Brani\u010devci]] and the [[Timo\u010dani]]) settled today's region around Novi Sad mainly in the 6th and 7th centuries.<ref name=\"Sava S 1998, page 36\">Sava S.

It became a part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the 11th and 12th centuries. Hungarians began to settle in the area, which before that time was mostly populated by Slavs, and the place was first mentioned under the Hungarian variant ''Peturwarad'' or ''P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin''/\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d), which derived from the Byzantine variant, found in documents from 1237. That same year, several other settlements were mentioned as existing in the territory of modern-day urban Novi Sad.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFrom the 13th century to the 16th century, the following settlements existed within the territory of the urban areas of modern-day Novi Sad:<ref name=Curcin>Branko \u0106ur\u010din, [[Slana Bara]] nekad i sad, Novi Sad, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Borovszky\">Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I.-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n*on the right bank of the Danube: ''P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin'') and ''Kamanc'' (Serbian: ''Kamenica'').\n*on the left bank of the Danube: ''Baksa'' or ''Baksafalva'' ({{lang-sr|Bak\u0161a, Bak\u0161i\u0107}}), ''K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton'' ({{lang-sr|Sent Marton}}), ''Bivalyos'' or ''Bivalo'' ({{lang-sr|Bivaljo\u0161, Bivalo}}), ''V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad'' or ''V\u00e1rad'' ({{lang-sr|Va\u0161aro\u0161 Varad, Varadinci}}), ''Zajol I'' (Serbian: ''[[Gornje Livade, Novi Sad|Sajlovo I]]'', ''Gornje Sajlovo'', ''Gornje Isailovo''), ''Zajol II'' (Serbian: ''[[Sajlovo]] II'', ''Donje Sajlovo'', ''Donje Isailovo''), ''Bistritz'' (Serbian: ''[[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Bistrica]]'').

For example, Bivalo (Bivaljo\u0161) was a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th\u20136th centuries.<ref name=\"Curcin\" /> Other names are of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] origin (for example B\u00e9lak\u00fat, K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton, V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad, R\u00e9v), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the [[Ottoman invasion]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Borovszky\" /> Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.\n\nTax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Bo\u017eo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th\u201317th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted during the Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBetween 1526 and 1687, the region was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the year 1590, the population of all villages that existed in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered at 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those inhabitants who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]]) was likely larger than was recorded.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0110or\u0111e Randelj|title=Novi Sad slobodan grad|location=Novi Sad|year=1997|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n=== Founding of Novi Sad ===\n[[File:Tabula_hungariae.jpg|thumb|left|Map from [[1528]] showing [[Petrovaradin]] (Peterwardein) and settlement named Bistrica (Bistritz) on the opposite side of [[Danube]].]]\n\nHabsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]] from residing in [[Petrovaradin]]. Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the 'Serb city' ({{lang-de|[[Rascians|Ratzen]] Stadt}}). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski \u0160anac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of [[Alma\u0161]] were resettled to Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, where they founded [[Alma\u0161ki Kraj]] ('the Alma\u0161 quarter').\n[[File:Razglednica Novog Sada 2.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of Novi Sad with a picture of Lajos Kossuth Street (early 20th century).]]\n\nAccording to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names ''Novi Sad'' and ''\u00dajvid\u00e9k'' (''Neoplanta'' in Latin) in 1748 when it became a 'free royal city'.\n\nThe edict that made Novi Sad a 'free royal city' was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads:\n{{quote|' We, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], by the grace of God [[Holy Roman Empress]],<br />Queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Prozor-Rama|Rama]], [[Serbia]], [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Lodomeria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [...]<br />cast this proclamation to anyone, whom it might concern... so that the renowned Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, which lies on the other side of the Danube in the [[Ba\u010dka]] province on the [[Sajlovo]] land, by the might of our divine royal power and prestige...make this town a [[Free imperial city|Free Royal City]] and to fortify, accept and acknowledge it as one of the free royal cities of our [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and other territories, by abolishing its previous name of Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, renaming it Neoplantae ([[Latin]]), \u00daj-Vid\u00e9gh ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), Neusatz ([[German language|German]]) and Novi Sad ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]) '|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.\n\n=== Habsburg Monarchy ===\n[[File:Patrijarh Rajacic blagosilja vojsku.JPG|thumb|left|[[Serb uprising of 1848\u201349]], Serbian patriarch [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] is giving a blessing to the army of Serbian Vojvodina in [[1848]] .]]\n\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the 'largest Serb municipality in the world'. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also [[Serbian Revival]]), who did not have their own [[Nation state|national state]] at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the 'Serbian [[Athens]]' (''Srpska Atina'' in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], 5,724 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 1,032 [[Protestantism|Protestants]], 727 [[Jews]], and 30 adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]]. The largest [[ethnic group]] in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were [[Germans]].\n[[File:Razglednica_Novog_Sada_1.jpg|thumb|right|Novi Sad on the postcard from 1900.]]\n\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolution of 1848\u201349]], Novi Sad was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian [[Autonomous area|autonomous region]] within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843. Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog]] County. The post office was opened in 1853.\n\nFollowing the [[compromise of 1867]], Novi Sad was located within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the ''[[Transleithania]]'', which comprised half of the new [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. During this time, the [[Magyarization]] policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city's inhabitants used the [[Serbian language]] most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups ([[Bunjevci]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Jews]], other [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 320</ref>\n\nSimilar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 317</ref> In 1910, the population included 13,383 [[Roman Catholics]] and 11,553 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], while 3,089 declared themselves as [[Lutheran]], 2,751 as [[Calvinist]], and 2,326 as [[Jewish]].<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/06700/06758/pdf/revai18_3.pdf \u00dajvid\u00e9k].

The city was almost completely destroyed during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848/1849 revolution]], so architecture from the 19th century dominates the [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|city centre]]. Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.\n\nDuring the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many [[plattenbau|communist-style]] [[high-rise]] buildings were erected. The total number of [[apartment building]]s, with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962\u201364, a new [[boulevard]], today called ''Bulevar oslobo\u0111enja'', was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, [[traffic congestion]] is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods of Novi Sad}}\n[[File:Novi Sad main street.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|King Alexander street]]\n[[File:Novi Sad City Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Novi Sad center at the night]]\n\nSome of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]] (Old Town), [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]], [[Podbara]], and [[Salajka]]. The areas of [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin]], located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad. [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], as well as [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards ([[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]] was divided into four sections, numbered I\u2013IV).\n\nNew neighbourhoods, like [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], [[Detelinara]] and [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]] and [[Bulevar]] neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings.  Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like [[Grbavica (Novi Sad)|Grbavica]] have completely been transformed.\n\nNeighbourhoods with single family homes are mostly located away from the city centre. [[Telep]], situated in the southwest, and [[Klisa, Serbia|Klisa]], in the north, are the oldest such districts. [[Adice]] and [[Veternik]], both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to an influx of Serb refugees fleeing the [[Yugoslav wars]].\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nWhile Novi Sad's urban municipalities, which include [[Petrovaradin]], [[Sremska Kamenica]] and Novi Sad proper, have a combined population of about 277,000, its suburban areas have approximately 65,000 inhabitants. Some 23.7% of the administrative city's total population resides in the suburbs, which consist of 12 settlements and 1 town.<ref name=Census /> The largest numbers live in [[Futog]] (pop. 20,000) and in [[Veternik]] (pop. 17,000) to the west. Both places have grown bigger over the years, especially during the 1990s, and have physically merged with the city.\n\nSuburbs like Futog are officially classified as an '<nowiki/>''urban settlement'<nowiki/>'' (town), while other suburbs are mostly considered to be '<nowiki/>''rural''' (village).  [[Ledinci]], [[Stari Ledinci]] and [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] are all villages located on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]]\u2019s slopes, with the last two having only one paved road. [[Stari Ledinci]] is the most isolated and least populated village belonging to Novi Sad\u2019s suburban areas.\n\nTowns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Temerin]] and [[Beo\u010din]] share the same [[public transport]]ation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!Status\n!City municipality\n!Population<ref name=Census />\n|-\n| 1 || [[Bege\u010d]] || rowspan=4|Village || rowspan=2|[[City municipality of Novi Sad|Novi Sad]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,325\n|-\n| 2 || [[Budisava]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|3,656\n|-\n| 3 || [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] || [[Petrovaradin]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,936\n|-\n| 4 || [[\u010cenej]] || rowspan=5|Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,125\n|-\n| 5 || [[Futog]] || rowspan=2|Town || style=\"text-align:right;\"|18,641\n|-\n| 6 || [[Ka\u0107]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11,740\n|-\n| 7 || [[Kisa\u010d]] || rowspan=6|Village || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,091\n|-\n| 8 || [[Kovilj]]  || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,414\n|-\n| 9 || [[Ledinci]] ||  Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,912\n|-\n| 10 || [[Rumenka]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,495\n|-\n| 11 || [[Stari Ledinci]] || Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 934\n|-\n| 12 || [[Stepanovi\u0107evo]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"|2,021\n|-\n| 13 || [[Veternik]] || Town || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 17,454\n|}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Demographic history of Novi Sad}}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1798|6890 |1848|18530 |1900|28763 |1910|33089 |1921|39122 |1931|63985 |1941|61731 |1948|69431 |1953|76752 |1961|102469 |1971|141375 |1981|170020 |1991|198326 |2002|216583 |2011|277522\n|\n}}\n\nNovi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia (after [[Belgrade]]), and the largest city in [[Vojvodina]]. Since its founding, the population of the city has been constantly increasing. According to the 1991 census, 56.2% of the people who came to Novi Sad from 1961 to 1991 were from Vojvodina, while 15.3% came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and 11.7% from rest of Serbia.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the city experienced significant population growth. According to the 2011 census,<ref name=\"media.popis2011.stat.rs\" /> the city's population is 250,439, while in its urban area (including adjacent settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica) there are 277,522 inhabitants.

During that time, almost every Serbian novelist, poet, jurist, and publisher had lived or worked in Novi Sad at some point in their career. Some of these cultural workers included [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Mika Anti\u0107]], [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj]] , among others. [[Matica srpska]], the oldest cultural-scientific institution in Serbia, was moved from [[Budapest]] to Novi Sad in 1864, and now contains the second-largest library in the country, the Library of Matica srpska, with over 3.5 million volumes. The [[Serbian National Theatre]], the oldest professional theatre among the [[South Slavs]], was founded in Novi Sad in 1861.\nToday, Novi Sad is the second largest cultural centre in [[Serbia]], after [[Belgrade]]. Municipal officials have made the city more attractive with numerous cultural events and music concerts. Since 2000, Novi Sad is home to the [[Exit (festival)|EXIT festival]], one of the biggest music summer festivals in Europe. Other important cultural events include the [[Sterijino pozorje]] theatre festival, [[Zmaj Children Games]], [[International Novi Sad Literature Festival]], [[Novi Sad Jazz Festival]], and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novisadtourism.org.yu/FMCultural.aspx?id=7&jez=2&selection=5&podselection=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082957/http://www.novisadtourism.org.yu/FMCultural.aspx?id=7&jez=2&selection=5&podselection=0|title=Festivali, manifestacije, kulturne, cultural, music, muzicke|archivedate=28 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> Novi Sad also hosts a fashion show twice a year, attracting local and international designers.

It is concurrent with Budapest\u2013Belgrade railroad, which connects it to major European cities. Novi Sad is connected with [[Zrenjanin]] and [[Timi\u0219oara]] on the northwest and [[Ruma]] on south with a regional highway; there are long-term plans to upgrade it to a motorway or an expressway, with a tunnel under the [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] shortcutting the ''Iri\u0161ki Venac'' mountain pass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/putovanja/vesti.php?nav_id=423315 |title=\"Poluautoput\" Novi Sad \u2013 Temi\u0161var? |publisher=B92 |date=2010-04-09 |language=Serbian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/192755/Tunel-kroz-Frusku-goru |title=Tunel kroz Fru\u0161ku goru |publisher=Blic|date=2010-06-07 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\nFour bridges cross the Danube in Novi Sad: Liberty Bridge (Most Slobode) connects [[Sremska Kamenica]] with the city proper.

Celts were present in the area since the 4th century BC and founded the first fortress on the right bank of the Danube. Later, in the 1st century BC, the region was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, with the name ''Cusum'', and was included in the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia]].\n[[File:Casque orn\u00e9 4\u00e8me si\u00e8cle Mus\u00e9e Novi Sad Colis\u00e9e Rome Italie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Roman golden helmet'', [[Museum of Vojvodina]]]]\n\nIn the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by [[Huns|Hunnic invasions]]. By the end of the same century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] had reconstructed the town and called it by the names ''Petrikon'' or ''Petrikov'' ({{lang-gr|\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd}}) after [[Saint Peter]].

It became a part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the 11th and 12th centuries. Hungarians began to settle in the area, which before that time was mostly populated by Slavs, and the place was first mentioned under the Hungarian variant ''Peturwarad'' or ''P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin''/\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d), which derived from the Byzantine variant, found in documents from 1237. That same year, several other settlements were mentioned as existing in the territory of modern-day urban Novi Sad.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\nFrom the 13th century to the 16th century, the following settlements existed within the territory of the urban areas of modern-day Novi Sad:<ref name=Curcin>Branko \u0106ur\u010din, [[Slana Bara]] nekad i sad, Novi Sad, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Borovszky\">Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I.-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n*on the right bank of the Danube: ''P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin'') and ''Kamanc'' (Serbian: ''Kamenica'').\n*on the left bank of the Danube: ''Baksa'' or ''Baksafalva'' ({{lang-sr|Bak\u0161a, Bak\u0161i\u0107}}), ''K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton'' ({{lang-sr|Sent Marton}}), ''Bivalyos'' or ''Bivalo'' ({{lang-sr|Bivaljo\u0161, Bivalo}}), ''V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad'' or ''V\u00e1rad'' ({{lang-sr|Va\u0161aro\u0161 Varad, Varadinci}}), ''Zajol I'' (Serbian: ''[[Gornje Livade, Novi Sad|Sajlovo I]]'', ''Gornje Sajlovo'', ''Gornje Isailovo''), ''Zajol II'' (Serbian: ''[[Sajlovo]] II'', ''Donje Sajlovo'', ''Donje Isailovo''), ''Bistritz'' (Serbian: ''[[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Bistrica]]'').

For example, Bivalo (Bivaljo\u0161) was a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th\u20136th centuries.<ref name=\"Curcin\" /> Other names are of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] origin (for example B\u00e9lak\u00fat, K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton, V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad, R\u00e9v), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the [[Ottoman invasion]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Borovszky\" /> Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.\n\nTax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Bo\u017eo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th\u201317th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted during the Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBetween 1526 and 1687, the region was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the year 1590, the population of all villages that existed in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered at 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those inhabitants who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]]) was likely larger than was recorded.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0110or\u0111e Randelj|title=Novi Sad slobodan grad|location=Novi Sad|year=1997|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n=== Founding of Novi Sad ===\n\n{{Quote box |width=23em |align=right|bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n|title=Historical affiliations\n|fontsize=90% |quote={{flagicon image|Flag of the Habsburg Monarchy.svg}} [[Habsburg Monarchy]] 1694\u20131804<br />\n{{flag|Austrian Empire}} 1804\u20131867<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of Austria-Hungary (1869-1918).svg}} [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] 1867\u20131918<br />\n{{flag|Kingdom of Serbia}} 1918<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.svg}} [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]{{refn|Officially known  as the ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'' until 1929}} 1918\u20131941<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of Hungary (1920\u20131946).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] 1941\u20131944<br />\n{{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}{{refn|Known  as ''Democratic Federal Yugoslavia'' until 1945}} 1944\u20131992<br />\n{{flag|Serbia and Montenegro}}{{refn|Officially known  as the ''Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'' until 2003}} 1992\u20132006<br />\n{{flag|Republic of Serbia}} 2006\u2013\n}}\n\nHabsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]] from residing in [[Petrovaradin]]. Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the 'Serb city' ({{lang-de|[[Rascians|Ratzen]] Stadt}}). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski \u0160anac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of [[Alma\u0161]] were resettled to Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, where they founded [[Alma\u0161ki Kraj]] ('the Alma\u0161 quarter').\n\nAccording to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names ''Novi Sad'' and ''\u00dajvid\u00e9k'' (''Neoplanta'' in Latin) in 1748 when it became a 'free royal city'.\n\nThe edict that made Novi Sad a 'free royal city' was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads:\n{{quote|' We, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], by the grace of God [[Holy Roman Empress]],<br />Queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Prozor-Rama|Rama]], [[Serbia]], [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Lodomeria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [...]<br />cast this proclamation to anyone, whom it might concern... so that the renowned Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, which lies on the other side of the Danube in the [[Ba\u010dka]] province on the [[Sajlovo]] land, by the might of our divine royal power and prestige...make this town a [[Free imperial city|Free Royal City]] and to fortify, accept and acknowledge it as one of the free royal cities of our [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and other territories, by abolishing its previous name of Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, renaming it Neoplantae ([[Latin]]), \u00daj-Vid\u00e9gh ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), Neusatz ([[German language|German]]) and Novi Sad ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]) '|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.\n\n=== Habsburg Monarchy ===\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the 'largest Serb municipality in the world'. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also [[Serbian Revival]]), who did not have their own [[Nation state|national state]] at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the 'Serbian [[Athens]]' (''Srpska Atina'' in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], 5,724 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 1,032 [[Protestantism|Protestants]], 727 [[Jews]], and 30 adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]]. The largest [[ethnic group]] in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were [[Germans]].\n[[File:\u00dajvid\u00e9k V\u00e1rosh\u00e1za 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Novi Sad main square, 1900]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolution of 1848\u201349]], Novi Sad was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian [[Autonomous area|autonomous region]] within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843. Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog]] County. The post office was opened in 1853.\n\nFollowing the [[compromise of 1867]], Novi Sad was located within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the ''[[Transleithania]]'', which comprised half of the new [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. During this time, the [[Magyarization]] policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city's inhabitants used the [[Serbian language]] most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups ([[Bunjevci]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Jews]], other [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 320</ref>\n\nSimilar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 317</ref> In 1910, the population included 13,383 [[Roman Catholics]] and 11,553 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], while 3,089 declared themselves as [[Lutheran]], 2,751 as [[Calvinist]], and 2,326 as [[Jewish]].<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/06700/06758/pdf/revai18_3.pdf \u00dajvid\u00e9k].

From 1 December 1918, Novi Sad was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]; and in 1929, it became the capital of the [[Danube Banovina]], a province of the newly-named Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1921, the population of Novi Sad numbered 39,122 inhabitants,  16,293 of whom spoke the Serbian language, 12,991 Hungarian, 6,373 German, 1,117 Slovak, etc.<ref>Agne\u0161 Ozer, \u017divot i istorija u Novom Sadu, Novi Sad, 2005, p. 15</ref>\n\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis powers]], and its northern parts, including Novi Sad, were annexed by [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]]. During [[World War II]], about 5,000 citizens were murdered and many others were resettled. During the three days of the [[1942 raid in Novi Sad|Novi Sad raid]] (21\u201323 January 1942) alone, Hungarian police killed 1,246 citizens, among them more than 800 Jews, and threw their corpses into the icy waters of the Danube.\n\nThe total death toll of the raid was around 2,500.<ref name=Cesarani>{{cite book|title=Genocide and Rescue: The Holocaust in Hungary 1944|author=David Cesarani|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HrK8B0VpFBkC&pg=PR7|page=13|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-85973-126-0|year=1997|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref name=Sajti>{{cite journal|title=The Former 'Southlands' in Serbia: 1918\u20131947|author=[[Enik\u0151 A.

Since 1945, Novi Sad has been the capital of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], a province of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Republic of Serbia]]. The city went through rapid industrialization and its population more than doubled in the period between World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter 1992, Novi Sad became a part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Devastated by [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombardment]] during the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, [[1999 NATO bombing of Novi Sad|Novi Sad was left]] without any of its three Danube bridges ([[\u017de\u017eelj Bridge]], [[Varadin Bridge]] and [[Liberty Bridge, Novi Sad|Liberty Bridge]]), communications, water, and electricity. Residential areas were cluster-bombed several times while the [[oil refinery]] was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage. In 2003, FR Yugoslavia was transformed into the [[Political union|state union]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. These two states separated in June 2006 (following the May 2006 [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum]]), leaving Novi Sad part of the [[Republic of Serbia]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city lies on the [[meander]] of the river Danube, which is only 350 meters wide beneath the marking stones of Petrovaradin.<ref name=\"GeoNS\" /> A section of the [[Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal|Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal]] marks the northern edge of the wider city centre.

The city was almost completely destroyed during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848/1849 revolution]], so architecture from the 19th century dominates the [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|city centre]]. Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.\n\nDuring the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many [[plattenbau|communist-style]] [[high-rise]] buildings were erected. The total number of [[apartment building]]s, with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962\u201364, a new [[boulevard]], today called ''Bulevar oslobo\u0111enja'', was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, [[traffic congestion]] is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods of Novi Sad}}\n[[File:Novi Sad main street.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|King Alexander street]]\n[[File:Novi Sad City Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Novi Sad center at the night]]\n\nSome of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]] (Old Town), [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]], [[Podbara]], and [[Salajka]]. The areas of [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin]], located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad. [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], as well as [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards ([[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]] was divided into four sections, numbered I\u2013IV).\n\nNew neighbourhoods, like [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], [[Detelinara]] and [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]] and [[Bulevar]] neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings.  Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like [[Grbavica (Novi Sad)|Grbavica]] have completely been transformed.\n\nNeighbourhoods with single family homes are mostly located away from the city centre. [[Telep]], situated in the southwest, and [[Klisa, Serbia|Klisa]], in the north, are the oldest such districts. [[Adice]] and [[Veternik]], both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to an influx of Serb refugees fleeing the [[Yugoslav wars]].\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nWhile Novi Sad's urban municipalities, which include [[Petrovaradin]], [[Sremska Kamenica]] and Novi Sad proper, have a combined population of about 277,000, its suburban areas have approximately 65,000 inhabitants. Some 23.7% of the administrative city's total population resides in the suburbs, which consist of 12 settlements and 1 town.<ref name=Census /> The largest numbers live in [[Futog]] (pop. 20,000) and in [[Veternik]] (pop. 17,000) to the west. Both places have grown bigger over the years, especially during the 1990s, and have physically merged with the city.\n\nSuburbs like Futog are officially classified as an '<nowiki/>''urban settlement'<nowiki/>'' (town), while other suburbs are mostly considered to be '<nowiki/>''rural''' (village).  [[Ledinci]], [[Stari Ledinci]] and [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] are all villages located on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]]\u2019s slopes, with the last two having only one paved road. [[Stari Ledinci]] is the most isolated and least populated village belonging to Novi Sad\u2019s suburban areas.\n\nTowns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Temerin]] and [[Beo\u010din]] share the same [[public transport]]ation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!Status\n!City municipality\n!Population<ref name=Census />\n|-\n| 1 || [[Bege\u010d]] || rowspan=4|Village || rowspan=2|[[City municipality of Novi Sad|Novi Sad]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,325\n|-\n| 2 || [[Budisava]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|3,656\n|-\n| 3 || [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] || [[Petrovaradin]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,936\n|-\n| 4 || [[\u010cenej]] || rowspan=5|Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,125\n|-\n| 5 || [[Futog]] || rowspan=2|Town || style=\"text-align:right;\"|18,641\n|-\n| 6 || [[Ka\u0107]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11,740\n|-\n| 7 || [[Kisa\u010d]] || rowspan=6|Village || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,091\n|-\n| 8 || [[Kovilj]]  || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,414\n|-\n| 9 || [[Ledinci]] ||  Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,912\n|-\n| 10 || [[Rumenka]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,495\n|-\n| 11 || [[Stari Ledinci]] || Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 934\n|-\n| 12 || [[Stepanovi\u0107evo]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"|2,021\n|-\n| 13 || [[Veternik]] || Town || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 17,454\n|}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Demographic history of Novi Sad}}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1798|6890 |1848|18530 |1900|28763 |1910|33089 |1921|39122 |1931|63985 |1941|61731 |1948|69431 |1953|76752 |1961|102469 |1971|141375 |1981|170020 |1991|198326 |2002|216583 |2011|277522\n|\n}}\n\nNovi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia (after [[Belgrade]]), and the largest city in [[Vojvodina]]. Since its founding, the population of the city has been constantly increasing. According to the 1991 census, 56.2% of the people who came to Novi Sad from 1961 to 1991 were from Vojvodina, while 15.3% came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and 11.7% from rest of Serbia.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the city experienced significant population growth. According to the 2011 census,<ref name=\"media.popis2011.stat.rs\" /> the city's population is 250,439, while in its urban area (including adjacent settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica) there are 277,522 inhabitants.

During that time, almost every Serbian novelist, poet, jurist, and publisher had lived or worked in Novi Sad at some point in their career. Some of these cultural workers included [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Mika Anti\u0107]], [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj]] , among others. [[Matica srpska]], the oldest cultural-scientific institution in Serbia, was moved from [[Budapest]] to Novi Sad in 1864, and now contains the second-largest library in the country, the Library of Matica srpska, with over 3.5 million volumes. The [[Serbian National Theatre]], the oldest professional theatre among the [[South Slavs]], was founded in Novi Sad in 1861.\nToday, Novi Sad is the second largest cultural centre in [[Serbia]], after [[Belgrade]]. Municipal officials have made the city more attractive with numerous cultural events and music concerts. Since 2000, Novi Sad is home to the [[Exit (festival)|EXIT festival]], one of the biggest music summer festivals in Europe. Other important cultural events include the [[Sterijino pozorje]] theatre festival, [[Zmaj Children Games]], [[International Novi Sad Literature Festival]], [[Novi Sad Jazz Festival]], and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novisadtourism.org.yu/FMCultural.aspx?id=7&jez=2&selection=5&podselection=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082957/http://www.novisadtourism.org.yu/FMCultural.aspx?id=7&jez=2&selection=5&podselection=0|title=Festivali, manifestacije, kulturne, cultural, music, muzicke|archivedate=28 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> Novi Sad also hosts a fashion show twice a year, attracting local and international designers.

Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>.

The 40-year agreement was renewed in 2003, causing some discussion. The levy paid to the state is not influenced by fluctuating [[Price of oil|oil price]], meaning Maersk could gain a much larger profit in times with high oil prices. The levy is 69 percent, lower than Norway's (80 percent). The UK raised the oil levy in 2006 due to high prices. As of November 2007, the price of oil had risen from US$22 to $96 per barrel, since the agreement of 2003, meaning that in 40 years' time, the company would not just earn the expected profit of 87 billion kroner, but 346 billion kroner, overall.<ref>[http://www.information.dk/149669 Staten g\u00e5r glip af oliefesten] infosite, 4 November 2007. {{in lang|da}}</ref> Government parties declined to change the agreement or raise the oil levy.

M\u00f8ller became CEO and chairman on his father's death in 1965.

M\u00f8ller\u2013Maersk A/S was granted concession to survey and exploit oil and [[natural gas]] resources in Denmark, rendering a [[monopoly]]-like status to Maersk. The 40-year agreement was renewed in 2003, causing some discussion. The levy paid to the state is not influenced by fluctuating [[Price of oil|oil price]], meaning Maersk could gain a much larger profit in times with high oil prices. The levy is 69 percent, lower than Norway's (80 percent). The UK raised the oil levy in 2006 due to high prices. As of November 2007, the price of oil had risen from US$22 to $96 per barrel, since the agreement of 2003, meaning that in 40 years' time, the company would not just earn the expected profit of 87 billion kroner, but 346 billion kroner, overall.<ref>[http://www.information.dk/149669 Staten g\u00e5r glip af oliefesten] infosite, 4 November 2007. {{in lang|da}}</ref> Government parties declined to change the agreement or raise the oil levy.
