It was recorded at the [[Audio Fidelity Records]] label in [[New York City]].\n\nThe title may refer to the short [[staccato]] or sharp \"popping\" sound used, or to [[pop music]] and its being \"corny\", i.e., [[kitsch]]y.<ref name=\"DOC\">Documentary, interview with Kingsley.{{which|date=March 2018}}</ref> The title is generally written as one word, although some single sleeves (such as the one illustrated) present it as two words, \"Pop Corn\".\n\nIn 1972, a re-recording of \"Popcorn\" by the band [[Hot Butter]] was a huge hit in many countries. The track has since been covered by a great number of artists.\n\n==Original version==\nComposer [[Gershon Kingsley]] (of [[Perrey and Kingsley]]) first recorded \"Popcorn\" for his 1969 album ''[[Music to Moog By]]''. In 1971 the track was rerecorded by Kingsley's band [[First Moog Quartet]]; later he released a version under the name of ''The Popcorn Makers'' and was this the version that hit most successfully the charts. The record was one of a rash of [[Moog synthesizer]]-based releases, following the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' albums chart success [[Wendy Carlos]] had in 1968 with ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'', and which characterized [[electronic music]] of the future.\n\nThere were two 7\" covers, both released in 1972 under [[Musicor Records]] and [[Stateside Records]] labels.\n\n==Hot Butter version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Popcorn\n| cover      = Popcorn (Hot Butter).jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Hot Butter]]\n| album      = Hot Butter\n| B-side     = At the Movies\n| released   = 1972\n| format     = [[7\" single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Synth-pop]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hot Butter: \"Popcorn\" |magazine= [[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]] |volume= 21 |year= 1995 |page= 30 |issn= 0730-0158}}</ref>\n| length     = 2:30\n| label      = {{unbulleted list|Interfusion (AUS)|[[Musicor Records|Musicor]] (US and Canada)}}\n| writer     = Gershon Kingsley<ref>{{cite web|title= ACE Repertory: Gershon Kingsley |publisher= [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] |accessdate= 31 January 2017 |url= https://mobile.ascap.com/aceclient/AceWeb/#ace/writer/70589265/KINGSLEY%20GERSHON}}</ref>\n| producer   = {{hlist|Bill Jerome|Steve Jerome}}\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Skokiaan]]\n| next_year  = 1973\n| misc       = {{Audio sample\n | type        = single\n | file        = Hot Butter - Popcorn.ogg\n | description = \"Popcorn\"\n}}\n}}\nIn 1972, [[Stan Free]], a fellow member of the [[First Moog Quartet]], rerecorded \"Popcorn\" with his band [[Hot Butter]], from the album ''Hot Butter''.\n\nThis version of \"Popcorn\" became the second primarily electronic-based piece of music to reach the American popular music charts, three years after \"[[Dick Hyman#Electronic pop|The Minotaur]]\" by [[Dick Hyman|Dick Hyman & His Electric Eclectics]]. It peaked at No. 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 4 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening chart]], and had even greater success in [[Australia]], topping the charts for 8 weeks. It proved equally as popular in mainland Europe, spending several weeks at No. 1 in numerous European countries, including [[France]] (4 weeks at the top) and [[Switzerland]] (10 weeks), ultimately becoming the biggest-selling single of 1972 in both countries.

The track has since been covered by a great number of artists.\n\n==Original version==\nComposer [[Gershon Kingsley]] (of [[Perrey and Kingsley]]) first recorded \"Popcorn\" for his 1969 album ''[[Music to Moog By]]''. In 1971 the track was rerecorded by Kingsley's band [[First Moog Quartet]]; later he released a version under the name of ''The Popcorn Makers'' and was this the version that hit most successfully the charts. The record was one of a rash of [[Moog synthesizer]]-based releases, following the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' albums chart success [[Wendy Carlos]] had in 1968 with ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'', and which characterized [[electronic music]] of the future.\n\nThere were two 7\" covers, both released in 1972 under [[Musicor Records]] and [[Stateside Records]] labels.\n\n==Hot Butter version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Popcorn\n| cover      = Popcorn (Hot Butter).jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Hot Butter]]\n| album      = Hot Butter\n| B-side     = At the Movies\n| released   = 1972\n| format     = [[7\" single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Synth-pop]]<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hot Butter: \"Popcorn\" |magazine= [[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]] |volume= 21 |year= 1995 |page= 30 |issn= 0730-0158}}</ref>\n| length     = 2:30\n| label      = {{unbulleted list|Interfusion (AUS)|[[Musicor Records|Musicor]] (US and Canada)}}\n| writer     = Gershon Kingsley<ref>{{cite web|title= ACE Repertory: Gershon Kingsley |publisher= [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] |accessdate= 31 January 2017 |url= https://mobile.ascap.com/aceclient/AceWeb/#ace/writer/70589265/KINGSLEY%20GERSHON}}</ref>\n| producer   = {{hlist|Bill Jerome|Steve Jerome}}\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Skokiaan]]\n| next_year  = 1973\n| misc       = {{Audio sample\n | type        = single\n | file        = Hot Butter - Popcorn.ogg\n | description = \"Popcorn\"\n}}\n}}\nIn 1972, [[Stan Free]], a fellow member of the [[First Moog Quartet]], rerecorded \"Popcorn\" with his band [[Hot Butter]], from the album ''Hot Butter''.\n\nThis version of \"Popcorn\" became the second primarily electronic-based piece of music to reach the American popular music charts, three years after \"[[Dick Hyman#Electronic pop|The Minotaur]]\" by [[Dick Hyman|Dick Hyman & His Electric Eclectics]]. It peaked at No. 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 4 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening chart]], and had even greater success in [[Australia]], topping the charts for 8 weeks. It proved equally as popular in mainland Europe, spending several weeks at No. 1 in numerous European countries, including [[France]] (4 weeks at the top) and [[Switzerland]] (10 weeks), ultimately becoming the biggest-selling single of 1972 in both countries.

Other tourist attractions include [[Aurangabad Caves]], [[Daulatabad Fort]], [[Grishneshwar Temple]], [[Jama Mosque, Aurangabad|Jama Mosque]], [[Himayat Bagh]], [[Panchakki]] and [[Salim Ali Lake]].

In 1308, the region was [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|annexed]] by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during the rule of [[Khalji dynasty|Sultan]] [[Alauddin Khalji]]. In 1327, the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted from [[Delhi]] to Daulatabad (in present-day Aurangabad) during the rule of [[Tughlaq dynasty|Sultan]] [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], who ordered a mass migration of Delhi's population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital was shifted back to Delhi. In 1499, Daulatabad became a part of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]]. In 1610, a new city named ''Kha\u1e0dk\u012b'' was established at the location of modern Aurangabad to serve as the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the [[Ethiopia]]n military leader [[Malik Ambar]], who was brought to India as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Malik Ambar was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of the city to ''Fatehnagar''. In 1636, [[Aurangzeb]], who was then the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan region, annexed the city into the Mughal Empire. In 1653, Aurangzeb renamed the city as \"Aurangabad\" and made it the capital of the Deccan region of the Mughal Empire. In 1724, the Mughal governor of the Deccan, [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Nizam Asaf Jah I]], seceded from the Mughal Empire and founded his own [[Asaf Jahi dynasty]]. The dynasty established the [[Hyderabad State|State of Hyderabad]] with their capital initially at Aurangabad, until they transferred their capital to the city of [[Hyderabad]] in 1763. Hyderabad State became a [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]], and remained so for 150 years (1798\u20131948). Until 1956, Aurangabad remained part of [[Hyderabad State (1948\u201356)|Hyderabad State]]. In 1960, Aurangabad and the larger [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking Marathwada region became a part of the state of Maharashtra.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Aurangabad, Maharashtra}}\n[[File:Zaibunissa palace.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Zeb-un-Nisa]]'s palace, Aurangabad 1880s.]]\n\n''Kha\u1e0dk\u012b'' was the original name of the village which was made a capital city by [[Malik Ambar]], the Prime Minister of [[Murtaza Nizam Shah II]], Sultan of [[Deccan sultanates|Ahmednagar]].

The lava flows are overlain by thin alluvial deposits along the Kham and Sukhana river. The basaltic lava flows belonging to the Deccan Trap is the only major geological formation occurring in Aurangabad. The lava flows are horizontal and each flow has two distinct units. The upper layers consist of [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]]a and [[Amygdule|amygdaloidal]] [[zeolitic]] [[basalt]] while the bottom layer consists of massive basalt. The lava flows are individually different in their ability to receive as well as hold water in storage and to transmit it. The difference in the productivity of groundwater in various flows arises as a result of their inherent physical properties such as porosity and permeability. The groundwater occurs under water table conditions and is mainly controlled by the extent of its secondary porosity i.e. thickness of weathered rocks and spacing of joints and fractures. The highly weathered vesicular trap and underlying weathered jointed and fractured massive trap constitutes the main water-yielding zones. The soil is mostly formed from igneous rocks and is black, medium black, shallow and calcareous types having different depths and profiles.<ref>Aher K.R.

In 1308, the region was [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|annexed]] by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during the rule of [[Khalji dynasty|Sultan]] [[Alauddin Khalji]]. In 1327, the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted from [[Delhi]] to Daulatabad (in present-day Aurangabad) during the rule of [[Tughlaq dynasty|Sultan]] [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], who ordered a mass migration of Delhi's population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital was shifted back to Delhi. In 1499, Daulatabad became a part of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]]. In 1610, a new city named ''Kha\u1e0dk\u012b'' was established at the location of modern Aurangabad to serve as the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the [[Ethiopia]]n military leader [[Malik Ambar]], who was brought to India as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Malik Ambar was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of the city to ''Fatehnagar''. In 1636, [[Aurangzeb]], who was then the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan region, annexed the city into the Mughal Empire. In 1653, Aurangzeb renamed the city as \"Aurangabad\" and made it the capital of the Deccan region of the Mughal Empire. In 1724, the Mughal governor of the Deccan, [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Nizam Asaf Jah I]], seceded from the Mughal Empire and founded his own [[Asaf Jahi dynasty]]. The dynasty established the [[Hyderabad State|State of Hyderabad]] with their capital initially at Aurangabad, until they transferred their capital to the city of [[Hyderabad]] in 1763. Hyderabad State became a [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]], and remained so for 150 years (1798\u20131948). Until 1956, Aurangabad remained part of [[Hyderabad State (1948\u201356)|Hyderabad State]].

The lava flows are overlain by thin alluvial deposits along the Kham and Sukhana river. The basaltic lava flows belonging to the Deccan Trap is the only major geological formation occurring in Aurangabad. The lava flows are horizontal and each flow has two distinct units. The upper layers consist of [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]]a and [[Amygdule|amygdaloidal]] [[zeolitic]] [[basalt]] while the bottom layer consists of massive basalt. The lava flows are individually different in their ability to receive as well as hold water in storage and to transmit it. The difference in the productivity of groundwater in various flows arises as a result of their inherent physical properties such as porosity and permeability. The groundwater occurs under water table conditions and is mainly controlled by the extent of its secondary porosity i.e. thickness of weathered rocks and spacing of joints and fractures. The highly weathered vesicular trap and underlying weathered jointed and fractured massive trap constitutes the main water-yielding zones. The soil is mostly formed from igneous rocks and is black, medium black, shallow and calcareous types having different depths and profiles.<ref>Aher K.R.

Every year WILI morning disc jockey Wayne Norman serves as the parade's Grand Marshal.\n\n==Translators==\n{{RadioTranslators\n| call1 = W237EL\n| freq1 = 95.3 MHz\n| fid1 = 140714\n| watts1 = 5\n| haat1 = 77\n| class1 = D\n| city1 = Willimantic, Connecticut\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Connecticut}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wili.com/}}\n{{AM station data|WILI}}\n*{{FMQ|W237EL}}\n*{{FMXL|W237EL}}\n\n{{Hall Communications}}\n\n[[Category:Willimantic, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Windham County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Connecticut|ILI]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1957]]\n[[Category:1957 establishments in Connecticut]]\n", "name_user": "2601:192:103:3000:c0ea:fb74:b118:d201", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WILI_(AM)"}

She is voiced by [[Julie Kavner]], and first appeared on television in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nMarge is the [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] of the Simpson family. With her husband [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], she has three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top \"TV moms\". She has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including [[List of The Simpsons video games|video games]], ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials, and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]]\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise.\n\nMarge's distinctive blue [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride's in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992. She was also nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in ''The Simpsons Movie''. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\n''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] (the characters [[Ageless|do not physically age]]), and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} Marge Simpson is the wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=239\u2013240}} She was raised by her parents, [[Jacqueline Bouvier (The Simpsons)|Jacqueline]] and [[Clancy Bouvier]].<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was |episodelink=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=1991-01-31 |season=02 |number=12}}</ref> She has a pair of sisters, the joyless [[Patty and Selma]], both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In \"[[The Way We Was]]\" ([[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]], 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met [[Homer Simpson]], after they both were sent to detention\u2014Homer for smoking in the bathroom with Barney, and Marge for burning her bra in a feminist protest. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go to the prom with him, although she ended up going with [[Artie Ziff]]  after Homer received tutoring lessons as a means to get to know her better, while knowing that she needed to sleep for a school meet. However, she regretted going with Artie when he started to pressure her to have sex after prom. At the end of the evening, while Artie drove her home after receiving a slap, she spied Homer walking along the side of the road with the corsage meant for her. After hearing her parents voicing their negative opinions about Homer, she took her own car and went back to give him a ride. She then told Homer she should've gone to the prom with him and he fixes her snapped shoulder strap with the corsage. During the ride, he tells her he will hug her and kiss her and never be able to let her go. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episodelink=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]] |network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-26 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought [[the Simpsons house|their first house]]. The episode \"[[That '90s Show]]\" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]], 2008) contradicted much of the established back-story; for example, it was revealed that Marge and Homer were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episodelink=That '90s Show |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=2008-01-27 |season=19 |number=11}}</ref>\n\nAs with many ''Simpsons'' characters, Marge's age and birthday changes to serve the story.

The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used.<ref>Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark.

She is voiced by [[Julie Kavner]], and first appeared on television in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nMarge is the [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] of the Simpson family. With her husband [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], she has three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top \"TV moms\". She has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including [[List of The Simpsons video games|video games]], ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials, and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]]\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise.\n\nMarge's distinctive blue [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride's in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992. She was also nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in ''The Simpsons Movie''. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\n''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] (the characters [[Ageless|do not physically age]]), and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} Marge Simpson is the wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=239\u2013240}} She was raised by her parents, [[Jacqueline Bouvier (The Simpsons)|Jacqueline]] and [[Clancy Bouvier]].<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was |episodelink=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=1991-01-31 |season=02 |number=12}}</ref> She has a pair of sisters, the joyless [[Patty and Selma]], both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In \"[[The Way We Was]]\" ([[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]], 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met [[Homer Simpson]], after they both were sent to detention\u2014Homer for smoking in the bathroom with Barney, and Marge for burning her bra in a feminist protest. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go to the prom with him, although she ended up going with [[Artie Ziff]]  after Homer received tutoring lessons as a means to get to know her better, while knowing that she needed to sleep for a school meet. However, she regretted going with Artie when he started to pressure her to have sex after prom. At the end of the evening, while Artie drove her home after receiving a slap, she spied Homer walking along the side of the road with the corsage meant for her. After hearing her parents voicing their negative opinions about Homer, she took her own car and went back to give him a ride. She then told Homer she should've gone to the prom with him and he fixes her snapped shoulder strap with the corsage. During the ride, he tells her he will hug her and kiss her and never be able to let her go. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episodelink=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]] |network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-26 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought [[the Simpsons house|their first house]].

(2004). Commentary for \"[[Marge in Chains]]\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so [[David M. Stern]] decided to write a Marge episode, which became \"[[Homer Alone]]\" ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1992). He felt that they could achieve a \"deeper vein\" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved.<ref>[[David M.

Commentary for \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name=\"americasfirstfamily\"/> To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used.<ref>Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark.

An edited version, named '''''Ninja Warrior''''', is screened in at least 18 other countries.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Development==\nRecorded on location at a [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|Midoriyama]] studio in [[Yokohama]], it airs on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] between [[Japanese television drama]] seasons. The show's name ''Sasuke'' is named after [[Sarutobi Sasuke]], a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jamison|first1=Leslie|title=The Great American Obstacle Course|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-great-american-obstacle-course|accessdate=19 August 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Each three-hour special (with the exceptions of ''Sasuke'' 24 and 36 which lasted 5 {{frac|1|2}} hours and 6 hours respectively) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 36 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, then became twice again since 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|\u7b4b\u8089\u756a\u4ed8|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.<ref>Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html \"Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'\"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.</ref> After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS has renamed the show once again, to '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition. TBS changed the show's logo for the 36th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 37 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]<ref>[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007</ref> in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,<ref>\"Yuuji Urushihara does it again\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011</ref> and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st competition (2015).\n\n===Popularity===\nThe popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.<ref>Levin, Gary.

December 7, 2010.</ref> As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), [[Ninja Warrior Germany|Germany]] ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) in 2018. An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.\n\n==Competitors==\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Sasuke All-Stars===\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe six consisted of:\n*'''Kazuhiko Akiyama''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist. He is known for being the first contestant to ever achieve total victory. He has not been able to repeat his success, being hindered by an eye condition known as degenerative [[retinitis]] that has been affecting him for years. Overall, he has competed 20 times and has been officially retired since ''Sasuke'' 28 in 2012. An offer was made for Akiyama to return for the 30th anniversary tournament in 2014, but he declined and has remained retired since.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n|+Akiyama's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2nd\n|| 100\n|| Failed Wall Lifting\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 3rd\n|| 99\n|| Failed Wall Lifting\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 4th\n|| 86\n|| '''Kanzenseiha (6.0 seconds to spare)'''\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 5th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 6th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Jump Hang\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 7th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Jump Hang\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 8th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Jump Hang\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 9th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Quintuple Step\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 10th\n|| 98\n|| Failed Warped Wall\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 11th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Body Prop\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 12th\n|| 97\n|| Failed Pipe Slider\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 13th\n|| 91\n|| Failed Crooked Wall\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 14th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 15th\n|| 81\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Metal Spin\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Circle Slider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 18th\u201319th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 20th\n|| 1901\n|| Failed Halfpipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\n|| 20\n|| Failed Halfpipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 23rd\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 24th\n|| 62\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 25th\n|| 98\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 26th\u201327th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Spinning Bridge    \n|| First\n|}\n\n*'''[[Makoto Nagano]]''', a fisherman and fishing boat captain.

He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33.

In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In ''Sasuke'' 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion. He finally made it to the Third Stage after 6 years in ''Sasuke'' 36, cleared the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, being the oldest to clear it, and also the oldest to attempt the next obstacle, the Vertical Limit, where he made it to the 3rd ledge before his grip gave out.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Urushihara's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| '''Competition'''\n|| '''Start position'''\n|| '''Obstacle'''\n|| '''Stage'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 72\n|| Failed Flying Chute\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\n|| 77\n|| Failed G-Rope\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 23rd\n|| 99\n|| Failed Unstable Bridge\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 24th\n|| 93\n|| '''Kanzenseiha (3.57 seconds to spare)'''\n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 25th\n| 100\n|| Failed Double Salmon Ladder\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 26th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Half-Pipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 27th\n|| 99 \n|| '''Kanzenseiha (6.71 seconds to spare)''' \n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 88 \n|| Failed Crazy Cliffhanger\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Backstream\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2993\n|| Failed Wall Lifting\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 99\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Double Pendulum\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Rolling Hill\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Vertical Limit Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Pipe Slider\n|| Third\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hitoshi Kanno|ja|3=\u83c5\u91ce\u4ec1\u5fd7}}''', a janitorial worker/jewelry designer.

athletes====\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage's Rolling Escargot.\n\nSprinter [[Hisatsugu Suzuki]], who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], appeared in the 13th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Cross Bridge.\n\nAnother competitor from the 1992 Olympics, gymnast [[Yoshiaki Hatakeda]], competed in the 6th tournament, making it all the way to Stage 3 before falling on the Cliff Hanger.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nPole Vaulter [[Seito Yamamoto]], who competed in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and also [[2018 Asian Games]], appeared in the 35th and 36th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Dragon Glider twice.\n\n====American athletes====\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&nbsp;\u2013 in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\n[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\n[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.\n\nLevi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.\n\nLevi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.\n\nHe has not competed in ''American Ninja Warrior'' ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |url=https://realeyeshomestead.com/about/ |website=Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n \nIn the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.\n\n=====Results=====\n*''Note: Does not include American Ninja Warrior results''\n*'''[[Morgan Hamm]]''', US Olympic Gymnast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Hamm's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||81\n||Failed Tarzan Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||93\n||Failed Curtain Cling\n||Third\n|}\n\n*'''[[Paul Hamm]]''', US Olympic Gymnast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Hamm's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||82\n||Failed Wall Lift<sup>\u2020</sup>\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||92\n||Failed Warped Wall\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||16th\n||94\n||Failed Metal Spin\n||Second\n|}\n\n\u2020&nbsp;- Hamm cleared the Second Stage with 0.1 seconds left, but walked through the gates without hitting the buzzer and as a result, was disqualified.\n\n*'''[[Paul Terek]]''', US Olympic Decathlete\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Terek's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||17th\n||86\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||18th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||19th\n||98\n||Failed Jumping Spider\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\u201321st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||98\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n||82\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|}\n\n*'''Levi Meeuwenberg''', an American [[freerunning|freerunner]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Meeuwenberg's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\n||1989\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||21st\n||99\n||Failed Salmon Ladder\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||91\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n||95\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||25th\n||48\n||Failed Slider Drop\n||Second\n|-\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||26th\u201336th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\n\n\u2020&nbsp;- Levi was supposed to compete in the 26th tournament, having earned a spot in the ''American Ninja Warrior'' preliminaries, but was ultimately unable to do so after breaking his wrist on ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', which occurred prior to the 26th tournament.

He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 31 and failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. He made his fourth appearance in ''Sasuke'' 32; he is the first person ever to beat the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger and the third American to clear the Japanese Cliffhanger, after Travis Allen Schroeder in ''Sasuke'' 4 and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8, but he failed the next obstacle Vertical Limit Kai. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he failed the second trial on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, due to timing problems on the moving ledge. He fell at the same place just like the last tournament in ''Sasuke'' 34. He managed to clear the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, the second time he cleared it. Unfortunately, he failed on the first ledge of the Vertical Limit, he managed to get hold of the ledge and made it halfway before falling in ''Sasuke'' 35.

In 2017, she became both the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') and Stage 2 at the original Mt. Midoriyama (''Sasuke'' 34).

During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again.

In the 7th competition, he was unable to beat the Rolling Log; In the 8th, he failed the Quintuple Step; In the 11th, he timed out on the Warped Wall. And in the 12th, he timed out on the Rope Climb.\n\n====Spanish athletes====\nSpanish gymnast [[Gervasio Deferr]], 2000 and 2004 Olympic Champion in the vault and 2008 silver medalist in the floor exercise, competed in the 10th competition but timed out a few feet from the buzzer on the First Stage's Rope Climb.\n\n====Taiwanese athletes====\n*'''Lee En-Chih''' (who was incorrectly listed as ''Lee Yen Chi'' in the US version and was mistakenly called ''Lee Enchi'' or ''Li En Zhi'' for years), is a professional rock climber from Taiwan. In his first attempt in ''Sasuke'' 17, he cleared the First Stage but failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 18, he failed the Jumping Spider in the First Stage. After a two-tournament absence, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 21 and was one of only nine competitors to make it to the Second Stage, timing out on Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he was one of four people to make it to the Third Stage, ultimately failing the Shin-Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he made it to the Final Stage for the first time but timed out 19 meters away. Li became the third foreigner to reach the Final Stage since [[Yordan Yovchev]] and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8. In ''Sasuke'' 25, he went to the Third Stage, but he failed the Ultimate Cliffhanger. He made it back to the Ultimate Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 26, but again failed there.  In ''Sasuke'' 25 and 26, Li finished first overall, becoming the only foreigner to have progressed further than any competitor in consecutive tournaments. After making it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger two times, it looked as if Li would go all the way in ''Sasuke'' 27. However, he shocked many when he failed the Step Slider in Stage 1. This was his earliest defeat ever, and first time failing Stage 1 since ''Sasuke'' 18. He failed the First Stage yet again in ''Sasuke'' 28, on the Spinning Bridge. He finally cleared the First Stage again in ''Sasuke'' 29, but timed out on the Passing Wall, on the Second Stage. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He decided to retire from ''Sasuke'' due to replacement by Taiwan representatives. Since ''Sasuke'' 31, his fellow Liao Long Zhun fully ruled the Taiwan representatives.

He failed the second obstacle, \"Hazard Swing\" after jumping from the swing, and missing the rope on the platform, falling into the water below. He also competed in the 29th competition, but failed the first obstacle, the \"Long Jump\", where he landed feet first onto the sandbox and jumped backwards into the water. Japanese featherweight mixed martial artist from DREAM [[Hideo Tokoro]] (announced as a \"freelance fighter\") was featured right after Minowaman in the 26th competition where he failed to grab the rope to swing himself to the other side in the first obstacle \"Step Slider\".\n\nSeveral professional wrestlers have also competed, including [[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]], [[Masanori Murakawa|The Great Sasuke]] (referred to as ''Great Ninja Warrior'' in the US and UK versions), [[Minoru Suzuki]], [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], [[Kota Ibushi]]  and [[Naohiro Hoshikawa]].

Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition.

Competing in heavy rain, Kane timed out on the Rope Climb; he has not competed since. Shane timed out on the Second Stage's Wall Lift in the 2nd competition, then failed the First Stage's Rolling Log in the 3rd competition. In the 4th, he came close to completing the First Stage but timed out on the Rope Climb. In the 6th and 7th competitions, he made it to the Third Stage, failing both times on the Body Prop. In the 8th competition, he failed to get past the First Stage's Warped Wall.

Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Sh\u014dei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.\n\nActor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions.

He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30. In ''Sasuke'' 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orug\u014dru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.\n\n[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actress]] [[Tomoko Kaneda]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband, [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 21 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in ''Sasuke'' 35. In ''Sasuke'' 36, when he reach the Reverse Conveyor, he used his legs to support himself on the sides of the Conveyor. This is something which is against the rules and thus he was disqualified.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Mori's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| 64\n|| Failed Rolling Log\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\u201320th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 11\n|| Failed Jumping Spider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\u201331st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 82\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 83\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 90\n|| Failed Quad Steps\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 76\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyer (disqualified)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 10\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|}\n\n[[Golden Bomber]] members Kenji Darvish and Yutaka Kyan also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Kyan failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Darvish had previously competed in ''Sasuke'' 28 and 30 and failed the First Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he finally completed the First Stage and failed the Cross Slider in the Second Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 32, Kyan did better on the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance on the new obstacle Tie Fighter. Darvish failed at the Tie Fighter when he lost his balance. In ''Sasuke'' 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting, while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 35. Darvish finally made to the Third Stage, he failed the transition to the Sidewinder Kai while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 36.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Darvish's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 31\n|| Failed Rolling Escargot\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2979\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 82\n|| Failed Cross Slider\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 91\n|| Failed Tie Fighter\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 82\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 89\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Wall Lifting (time out)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 98\n|| Failed Sidewinder Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 97\n|| Failed Dragon Glider\n|| First\n|}\n\n[[Model (person)|Model]] Shimon Okura competed in ''Sasuke'' 30.

Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&nbsp;\u2013 for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st\u20133rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26\u201328), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman Masumi Yagi was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} Wakky competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n===Other notable competitors===\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n46-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\n===Women in ''Sasuke''===\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.<ref>In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.</ref> She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.\n\n[[:jp:\u904a\u4f50\u96c5\u7f8e|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as \"Miyabi\" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a \"Warrior Wipeout\" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.\n\nAll three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4\u20136)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times \u2013 the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.\n* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.\n* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.\n\nAmerican gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] \u2013 the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') \u2013 was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament. She did not return until Sasuke 37, however, but she went on to clear stage 1 and 2 again, becoming the only woman to reach stage 3 twice. She failed the first flip of the Cliffhanger Dimension, in the same place as Sasuke 34. '''''(insert list of runs here)'''''\n\nA Shinkin Bank employee who has been competed on ''Kunoichi'', Ayano Oshima, She first completed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Her run was digested, but it was shown that she had timed out as she was getting up the Warped Wall. Ayano once again returned for ''Sasuke'' 36. She was the first Japanese woman to ever clear the Dragon Glider. Although, she became to tired after finishing the tackle, and timed out at the Warped Wall.\n\n===American Ninja Challenges===\n{{Main|American Ninja Challenge}}\nIn fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28\u201330 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&nbsp;\u2013 the first woman to qualify&nbsp;\u2013 of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|List of Sasuke competitions}}\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1\u2013100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory).

The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.\n\n{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names \"{{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0}}\"(Free Climbing) and \"{{lang|ja|\ufffd?\u767b\u308a}}\"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the \"Mountain Climb\" in subtitles.\n\n{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later be replaced with the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.\n\n{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Prism See-Saw\" is called the \"Prism Tilt\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Prism See-Saw.\"\n\n{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Cross Bridge\" is called the \"Bridge of Blades\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Cross Bridge.\"\n\n{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the \"Rope Hang,\" but that name is erroneous.\n\n{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.\n\n{{note|8|8}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Double Pendulum\" is called the \"Tic Toc\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.\n\n{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Rolling Escargot\" is called the \"Rolling Snail\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|12|12}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Tackle\" is called the \"Triple Tackle\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|13|13}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"TIE Fighter\" is called the \"Prop Slider\" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] to use the name associated with the Star Wars fighter after which the obstacle was named.\n\n===Stage 2===\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. ''Sasuke''\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

\u2014 This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af}}\" (Spider Walk), \"{{lang|ja|\u52d5\u304f\u58c1}}\" (Moving Walls) and \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0}}\" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it \"Spider Walk\".\n\n{{note|2|2}} The onscreen Japanese graphics \"{{lang|ja|\u4e94\u9023\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}\" reveal this obstacle's official name as \"Five Continuous Hammers\". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.\n\n{{note|3|3}} In those competitions there are two \"Moving Walls\" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.\n\n{{note|4|4}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.\n\n{{note|5|5}} The Rolling Log appeared in SASUKE 37 as the original first obstacle of Stage 2, but due to rain, it did not function correctly. The judges decided to start Stage 2 at the Salmon Ladder Ascent with a lowered time limit of 100 seconds.\n\n</div>\n\n===Third Stage===\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|\u5b8c\u5168\u5236\u8987}}), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15-meter (49&nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20-meter (66&nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5-meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18\u201324 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7\u201317 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (\u7db1\u767b\u308a) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35-second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\" As of 2019, new episodes have not been shown on U.S. airwaves, and the 27th competition remains the most recent one to be aired in America.\n\n====''American Ninja Warrior''====\n\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}\nThe popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 2)|second season]] was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe [[American Ninja Warrior (season 3)|third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'']] debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&nbsp;\u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 5)|fifth season]] on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 6)|sixth season]] on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|seventh season]] in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff \u2013 ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube</ref>) The network has renewed the show once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|eighth season]] in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 10)|tenth season]] of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 11)|eleventh season]] began airing on May 29, 2019 with two new cities ([[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Cincinnati]]), a chance to go directly to Las Vegas with the Speed Pass in the Power Tower duel between the two fastest players, and a new co-host, [[Zuri Hall]]. In addition, Drew Drechsel became the third person to achieve Total Victory at the end of the season.\n\n=====''USA vs Japan''=====\n{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}\n\nIn 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&nbsp;\u2013 one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6\u20130 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\n=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}\n\nWith the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015. The spin-off consists of 24 teams of three members featuring past and current ''ANW'' contestants from the first seven seasons. The series began airing on January 19, 2016 and is hosted by Akbar Gbaja-Biamila and Matt Iseman with sideline reporter Alex Curry.\n\n''College Madness'' features college teams in a five-week competition. The second season began airing on November 22, 2016 with Iseman and Biama as hosts and ''ANW'' season six contestant [[Kacy Catanzaro]] as the sideline reporter.\n\n[[USA Network|USA]] renewed the show for its second full season.\n\nIn 2018 the network renamed the show to ''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja'' with Iseman, Biama, and Curry as hosts and new teams for its third season.\n\n===== ''American Ninja Warrior Junior'' =====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior Junior}}\nOn May 2, 2018, [[Universal Kids]] announced a second spin-off called ''American Ninja Warrior Junior''. The spin-off consists of 192 kids from across America as they compete head to head in three different age brackets: 9-10, 11-12, and 13\u201314 years old. Each bracket will be mentored by All-Star Ninja Mentors: Drew Dreschel, Barclay Stockett, Kevin Bull, Natalie Duran, Najee Richardson and Meagan Martin. The series began airing on October 13, 2018, with Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, joined by Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez as hosts.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe American-edited ''Ninja Warrior'' episodes are broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]]. The show has been re-edited to remove the subtitles from the footage of the competitors taking part in the stages, but retain them for contestant interviews. The \"Ninja Killer\" and \"Warrior Wipeout\" sections remain, but there is only one advertisement break halfway through the show.\n\nThe show was voiced-over by [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] for its first three series, aired between 2007 and 2008. In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over. Challenge has now removed Hall's commentary from the first three series, following his imprisonment in June 2013, and re-dubbed them with new commentary by North. As of July 2012, all American edited episodes, covering all tournaments up to ''Sasuke'' 27, had aired in the UK. A new run of edited episodes airing in March 2016 was produced in the UK for Challenge, covering the ''Sasuke Rising'' tournaments, once again voiced by North. Another run of brand new edited episodes airing in June 2018 was again produced in the UK for Challenge, covering ''Sasuke'' tournaments 31\u201334, also voiced by North.\n\n====''Ninja Warrior UK''====\n{{main|Ninja Warrior UK}}\nIt was announced on 22 December 2014 that a UK remake of the format, similar to that of the American version, would be aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2015.

In Stage 2, common ''Sasuke'' obstacles (Salmon Ladder, double Warped Wall) appeared, and competitors had 100 seconds to clear this stage.  Only eight competitors made it to Stage 3, which featured typical Stage 3 obstacles: Pole Maze, Spinning Bridge, Rumbling Dice, Spider Flip, Cliffhanger, and Pipe Slider.

Its popularity in Japan and its growing popularity in the United States has resulted in a long-term run at the [[Sahara Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas.\n\nEvery January TBS airs the ''[[Pro Sportsman No.1]]'' competition, also produced by Monster9. Several people who have competed on ''Sasuke'' have participated in this competition.\n\nOn [[Odaiba]] island, Monster9 has built Muscle Park, an indoor [[theme park]] based on events from ''Sasuke'' and other ''Muscle Ranking'' related programs.

The show's name ''Sasuke'' is named after [[Sarutobi Sasuke]], a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jamison|first1=Leslie|title=The Great American Obstacle Course|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-great-american-obstacle-course|accessdate=19 August 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Each three-hour special (with the exceptions of ''Sasuke'' 24 and 36 which lasted 5 {{frac|1|2}} hours and 6 hours respectively) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 36 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, then became twice again since 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|\u7b4b\u8089\u756a\u4ed8|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.<ref>Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html \"Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'\"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.</ref> After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS has renamed the show once again, to '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition. TBS changed the show's logo for the 36th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 37 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]<ref>[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007</ref> in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,<ref>\"Yuuji Urushihara does it again\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011</ref> and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).\n\n===Popularity===\nThe popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.<ref>Levin, Gary.

December 7, 2010.</ref> As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), [[Ninja Warrior Germany|Germany]] ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) in 2018. An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.\n\n==Competitors==\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Sasuke All-Stars===\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe six consisted of:\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist. He is known for being the first contestant to ever achieve total victory.

He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33.

athletes====\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage's Rolling Escargot.\n\nSprinter [[Hisatsugu Suzuki]], who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], appeared in the 13th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Cross Bridge.\n\nAnother competitor from the 1992 Olympics, gymnast [[Yoshiaki Hatakeda]], competed in the 6th tournament, making it all the way to Stage 3 before falling on the Cliff Hanger.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nPole Vaulter [[Seito Yamamoto]], who competed in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and also [[2018 Asian Games]], appeared in the 35th and 36th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Dragon Glider twice.\n\n====American athletes====\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&nbsp;\u2013 in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\n[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\n[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.\n\nLevi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.\n\nLevi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle.

Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Sh\u014dei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.\n\nActor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions. In his first attempt, he failed the Jump Hang in the First Stage, but in the next tournament, he made it all the way to the Third, where he was defeated by the first obstacle, the Propeller Bars.\n\nActor and singer [[Tetsuji Sakakibara]] competed four times (23rd\u201326th tournaments) but never cleared the First Stage, failing on the Jumping Spider in the 23rd and 24th tournaments, the Jump Hang in the 25th tournament, and the Half-Pipe Attack in the 26th tournament.\n\nActor [[Ryosuke Yamamoto (actor)|Ryosuke Yamamoto]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 and ''Sasuke'' 31.

She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband, [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 21 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in ''Sasuke'' 35. In ''Sasuke'' 36, when he reach the Reverse Conveyor, he used his legs to support himself on the sides of the Conveyor.

Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&nbsp;\u2013 for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st\u20133rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26\u201328), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=\u30ef\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n===Other notable competitors===\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n46-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\n===Women in ''Sasuke''===\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.<ref>In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.</ref> She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.\n\n[[:jp:\u904a\u4f50\u96c5\u7f8e|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as \"Miyabi\" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a \"Warrior Wipeout\" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.\n\nAll three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4\u20136)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times \u2013 the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.\n* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.\n* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.\n\nAmerican gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] \u2013 the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') \u2013 was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament. She did not return until Sasuke 37, however, but she went on to clear stage 1 and 2 again, becoming the only woman to reach stage 3 twice. She failed the first flip of the Cliffhanger Dimension, in the same place as Sasuke 34. '''''(insert list of runs here)'''''\n\nA Shinkin Bank employee who has been competed on ''Kunoichi'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Ayano Oshima|ja|3=\u5927\u5d8b\u3042\u3084\u306e}}, She first completed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Her run was digested, but it was shown that she had timed out as she was getting up the Warped Wall. Ayano once again returned for ''Sasuke'' 36. She was the first Japanese woman to ever clear the Dragon Glider. Although, she became to tired after finishing the tackle, and timed out at the Warped Wall.\n\n===American Ninja Challenges===\n{{Main|American Ninja Challenge}}\nIn fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28\u201330 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&nbsp;\u2013 the first woman to qualify&nbsp;\u2013 of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|List of Sasuke competitions}}\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1\u2013100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on ''Sasuke''. All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\n=== ''Sasuke'' 1 ===\n{{See also|List of Sasuke competitions#1st competition}}\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible

The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.\n\n{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names \"{{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0}}\"(Free Climbing) and \"{{lang|ja|\ufffd?\u767b\u308a}}\"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the \"Mountain Climb\" in subtitles.\n\n{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later be replaced with the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.\n\n{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Prism See-Saw\" is called the \"Prism Tilt\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Prism See-Saw.\"\n\n{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Cross Bridge\" is called the \"Bridge of Blades\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Cross Bridge.\"\n\n{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the \"Rope Hang,\" but that name is erroneous.\n\n{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.\n\n{{note|8|8}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Double Pendulum\" is called the \"Tic Toc\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.\n\n{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Rolling Escargot\" is called the \"Rolling Snail\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|12|12}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Tackle\" is called the \"Triple Tackle\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|13|13}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"TIE Fighter\" is called the \"Prop Slider\" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] to use the name associated with the Star Wars fighter after which the obstacle was named.\n\n===Stage 2===\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. ''Sasuke''\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

\u2014 This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af}}\" (Spider Walk), \"{{lang|ja|\u52d5\u304f\u58c1}}\" (Moving Walls) and \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0}}\" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it \"Spider Walk\".\n\n{{note|2|2}} The onscreen Japanese graphics \"{{lang|ja|\u4e94\u9023\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}\" reveal this obstacle's official name as \"Five Continuous Hammers\". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.\n\n{{note|3|3}} In those competitions there are two \"Moving Walls\" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.\n\n{{note|4|4}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.\n\n{{note|5|5}} The Rolling Log appeared in SASUKE 37 as the original first obstacle of Stage 2, but due to rain, it did not function correctly. The judges decided to start Stage 2 at the Salmon Ladder Ascent with a lowered time limit of 100 seconds.\n\n</div>\n\n===Third Stage===\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|\u5b8c\u5168\u5236\u8987}}), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15-meter (49&nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20-meter (66&nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5-meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18\u201324 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7\u201317 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (\u7db1\u767b\u308a) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35-second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\" As of 2019, new episodes have not been shown on U.S. airwaves, and the 27th competition remains the most recent one to be aired in America.\n\n====''American Ninja Warrior''====\n\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}\nThe popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 2)|second season]] was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe [[American Ninja Warrior (season 3)|third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'']] debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&nbsp;\u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 5)|fifth season]] on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 6)|sixth season]] on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|seventh season]] in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff \u2013 ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube</ref>) The network has renewed the show once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|eighth season]] in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 10)|tenth season]] of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 11)|eleventh season]] began airing on May 29, 2019 with two new cities ([[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Cincinnati]]), a chance to go directly to Las Vegas with the Speed Pass in the Power Tower duel between the two fastest players, and a new co-host, [[Zuri Hall]]. In addition, Drew Drechsel became the third person to achieve Total Victory at the end of the season.\n\n=====''USA vs Japan''=====\n{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}\n\nIn 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&nbsp;\u2013 one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6\u20130 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\n=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}\n\nWith the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015.

In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over.

Also in 1882, the [[California Southern Railroad]], a subsidiary of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]] completed construction of the section from [[National City, California|National City]] to Temecula. In 1883, the line was extended to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. In the late 1880s, a series of floods washed out the tracks and the section of the railroad through the canyon was finally abandoned. The old Temecula station was used as a barn and later demolished.\n\nIn the 1890s, with the operation of [[granite]] stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and hitching posts, curb stones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At the turn of the 20th century, Temecula became an important shipping point for grain and cattle.\n\n===1900\u20131989===\n[[File:Temecula-1909.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Temecula, 1909.]]\nIn 1904 Walter L.

Vail bought ranchland in the Temecula Valley, buying {{convert|38000|acre|km2|0}} of Rancho Temecula and Rancho Pauba, along with the northern half of Rancho Little Temecula. Vail was killed by a street car in Los Angeles in 1906; his son, Mahlon Vail, took over the family ranch. In 1914, financed by Mahlon Vail and local ranchers, the First National Bank of Temecula opened on Front Street. In 1915, the first paved, two-lane county road was built through Temecula.\n\nBy 1947, the Vail Ranch contained over {{convert|87500|acre|km2|0}}. In 1948, the Vail family built a dam to catch the [[Temecula Creek]] water and created [[Vail Lake]]. Through the mid-1960s, the economy of the Temecula Valley centered around the Vail Ranch; the cattle business and agriculture were the stimuli for most business ventures. In 1964, the Vail Ranch was sold to the [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]] [[Aetna]] partnership. A later purchase by the group brought the total area to {{convert|97500|acre|km2|0}}, and the area became known as Rancho California. The I-15 corridor between the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area and San Diego was completed in the early 1980s, and the subdivision land boom began.\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nThe 1990s brought rapid growth to the Temecula Valley.

The old Temecula station was used as a barn and later demolished.\n\nIn the 1890s, with the operation of [[granite]] stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and hitching posts, curb stones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At the turn of the 20th century, Temecula became an important shipping point for grain and cattle.\n\n===1900\u20131989===\n[[File:Temecula-1909.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Temecula, 1909.]]\nIn 1904 Walter L. Vail, who had come to the United States with his parents from [[Nova Scotia]], migrated to California. Along with various partners, he began buying land in Southern California. Vail bought ranchland in the Temecula Valley, buying {{convert|38000|acre|km2|0}} of Rancho Temecula and Rancho Pauba, along with the northern half of Rancho Little Temecula. Vail was killed by a street car in Los Angeles in 1906; his son, Mahlon Vail, took over the family ranch. In 1914, financed by Mahlon Vail and local ranchers, the First National Bank of Temecula opened on Front Street. In 1915, the first paved, two-lane county road was built through Temecula.\n\nBy 1947, the Vail Ranch contained over {{convert|87500|acre|km2|0}}. In 1948, the Vail family built a dam to catch the [[Temecula Creek]] water and created [[Vail Lake]]. Through the mid-1960s, the economy of the Temecula Valley centered around the Vail Ranch; the cattle business and agriculture were the stimuli for most business ventures. In 1964, the Vail Ranch was sold to the [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]] [[Aetna]] partnership. A later purchase by the group brought the total area to {{convert|97500|acre|km2|0}}, and the area became known as Rancho California. The I-15 corridor between the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area and San Diego was completed in the early 1980s, and the subdivision land boom began.\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nThe 1990s brought rapid growth to the Temecula Valley. Many families began moving to the area from San Diego, Los Angeles, and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], drawn by the affordable housing prices and the popular wine country.

After a period of rapid population growth and home construction, the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] and the resultant [[United States housing market correction]] caused a sharp rise in home [[foreclosure]]s in the Temecula-Murrieta region.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.28|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|37.27|sqmi|km2|1}} of it is land and {{convert|0.012|sqmi|km2|3}} of it (0.03%) is water.
