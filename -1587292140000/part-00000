It is also used as a trading language in the southern [[Philippines]], including the southern parts of the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and the southern predominantly [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]]-inhabited municipalities of [[Bataraza]] and [[Balabac, Palawan|Balabac]] in [[Palawan]].\n\nAs the {{lang|ms|Bahasa Kebangsaan}} or {{lang|ms|Bahasa Nasional}} (\"national language\") of several states, Standard Malay has various official names. In Malaysia, it is designated as either {{lang|ms|Bahasa Malaysia}} (\"[[Malaysian language]]\") or {{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}} (\"Malay language\"). In Singapore and Brunei, it is called {{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}} (\"Malay language\") and in Indonesia, an autonomous normative variety called {{lang|ms|Bahasa Indonesia}} (\"[[Indonesian language]]\") is designated the {{lang|ms|Bahasa Persatuan/Pemersatu}} (\"unifying language\"/[[lingua franca]]). However, in areas of central to southern [[Sumatra]] where vernacular varieties of Malay are indigenous, Indonesians refer to it as {{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}} and consider it one of their regional languages.\n\nStandard Malay, also called Court Malay, was the literary standard of the pre-colonial [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] and [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] Sultanates, and so the language is sometimes called Malacca, Johor or Riau Malay (or various combinations of those names) to distinguish it from the various other [[Malayan languages]]. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'' 16, several of the Malayan varieties they currently list as separate languages, including the {{lang|ms|[[Orang Asli]]}} varieties of Peninsular Malay, are so closely related to standard Malay that they may prove to be dialects. There are also several [[Malay trade and creole languages]] which are based on a lingua franca derived from Classical Malay as well as [[Malay trade and creole languages#Macassar Malay|Macassar Malay]], which appears to be a [[mixed language]].\n\n==Origin==\n\nMalay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malay homeland being in western [[Borneo]] stretching to the [[Brunei]]an coast.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Adelaar |first=K.

A literary language was established in [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. After the defeat of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1511, the literary center shifted to the [[Johor-Riau Sultanate]], and the literary language is therefore often called Johor-Riau Malay, though it is a continuation of Malacca Malay. When Johor was divided between [[British Malaya]] ([[Johor]]) and the [[Dutch East Indies]] ([[Riau]]), its language was accorded official status in both territories.\n\nIndonesia pronounced \"Riau\" (Malacca\u2013Johor) Malay its official language (''Bahasa Indonesia'') when it gained independence. Since 1928, nationalists and young people throughout the Indonesian archipelago had declared Malay to be Indonesia's only official language, as proclaimed in the ''[[Sumpah Pemuda]]'' \"Youth Vow.\" Thus Indonesia was the first country to designate Malay as an official language.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IDS Languages of Indonesia (Sumatra)]</ref>\n\nIn Malaysia, the 1957 [[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 152|Article 152]] of the Federation adopted Johor (Malacca) Malay as the official language (''Bahasa Malaysia''). The name \"Malaysia\", in both language and country, emphasised that the nation consisted of more than just ethnic [[Malay people|Malays]]. In 1986 the official name was changed to ''Bahasa Melayu'', but in 2007 it was changed back.<ref>[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/bm/news.php?id=294230 Penggunaan Istilah Bahasa Malaysia Dan Bukan Bahasa Melayu Muktamad, Kata Zainuddin]. BERNAMA, 5 November 2007</ref>\n\n\"Bahasa Melayu\" was defined as Brunei's official language in the country's 1959 Constitution. It is also based on the Malaccan standard.\n\nThe Indonesian and Malaysian [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s of Malay are separated by some centuries of different vocabulary development (see [[Differences between Malaysian and Indonesian]]; cf. [[Serbo-Croatian]]). This is, in part, partly due to the influence of different colonial languages; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the case of Indonesia (see [[Dutch East Indies]]), and [[English language|English]] in the case of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, which were formerly under [[British Empire|British rule]]. However, Indonesia and Malaysia largely unified their previously divergent orthographies in 1972, and they along with Brunei have set up a joint commission to develop common scientific and technical vocabulary and otherwise co-operate to keep their standards convergent.\n\nSome Malay [[dialect]]s, however, show only limited [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language; for example, [[Kelantan Malay language|Kelantanese]] or [[Sarawak Malay|Sarawakian]] pronunciation is difficult for many fellow Malaysians to understand, while [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] contains many words unfamiliar to speakers of Malaysian, some because of [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] or other [[Languages of Indonesia|local language]] influence, and some because of the independent development of [[Indonesian slang language|Indonesian slang]] and colloquial parlance.\n\nThe language spoken by the [[Peranakan]] (Straits Chinese, a hybrid of Chinese settlers from the [[Ming Dynasty]] and local Malays) is a unique [[patois]] of Malay and the [[Hokkien Chinese]], which is mostly spoken in the former [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]] in Malaysia, and the Indonesian Archipelago. -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lawah-Lawah Merah (1875).pdf|thumb|''Lawah-Lawah Merah'' (1875), a Malay-language translation of ''L'araign\u00e9e rouge'' by {{ill|Ren\u00e9 de Pont-Jest|fr}} has been identified as the first Malay-language novel.

The laws were for the [[Minangkabau people]], who today still live in the highlands of [[Sumatra]].\n\nThe Malay language came into widespread use as the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] (1402\u20131511). During this period, the Malay language developed rapidly under the influence of Islamic literature. The development changed the nature of the language with massive infusion of [[Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]] vocabularies, called ''Classical Malay''. Under the Sultanate of Malacca the language evolved into a form recognisable to speakers of modern Malay. When the court moved to establish the Johor Sultanate, it continued using the classical language; it has become so associated with Dutch Riau and British Johor that it is often assumed that the Malay of Riau is close to the classical language. However, there is no closer connection between Malaccan Malay as used on Riau and the Riau vernacular.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sneddon|first=James N.|title=The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&pg=PA70|year=2003|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-598-8|page=70}}</ref>\n\nAmong the oldest surviving letters written in Malay are the letters from Sultan Abu Hayat of [[Ternate]], [[Maluku Islands]] in present-day Indonesia, dated around 1521\u20131522.

[[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], a geographic outlier spoken in [[Madagascar]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], is also a member of this language family. Although these languages are not necessarily mutually intelligible to any extent, their similarities are rather striking. Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, [[Proto-Austronesian language]]. There are many [[cognate]]s found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.\n\nWithin Austronesian, Malay is part of a cluster of numerous closely related [[variety (linguistics)|forms of speech]] known as the [[Malayic languages]], which were spread across Malaya and the Indonesian archipelago by Malay traders from Sumatra. There is disagreement as to which varieties of speech popularly called \"Malay\" should be considered dialects of this language, and which should be classified as distinct Malay languages. The [[vernacular]] of Brunei\u2014[[Brunei Malay]]\u2014for example, is not readily intelligible with the [[standard language]], and the same is true with some lects on the Malay Peninsula such as [[Kedah Malay]]. However, both Brunei and Kedah are quite close.<ref>''[[Ethnologue]]'' 16 classifies them as distinct languages, ISO3 ''kxd'' and ''meo'', but states that they \"are so closely related that they may one day be included as dialects of Malay\".</ref>\n\nThe closest relatives of the Malay languages are those left behind on Sumatra, such as the [[Minangkabau language]], with 5.5 million speakers on the west coast.\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Malay alphabet}}\n[[File:Kerinci MSS detail.jpg|thumb|The [[Rencong alphabet]], a native writing system found in Malay Peninsula, central and [[South Sumatra]].

Latin script is official in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Malay uses [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]].\n\n''Rumi'' and ''Jawi'' are co-official in [[Brunei]] only. Names of institutions and organisations have to use Jawi and Rumi (Latin) scripts. Jawi is used fully in schools, especially the Religious School, ''Sekolah Agama'', which is compulsory during the afternoon for Muslim students aged from around 6\u20137 up to 12\u201314.\n\nEfforts are currently being undertaken to preserve Jawi in rural areas of Malaysia, and students taking Malay language examinations in Malaysia have the option of answering questions using Jawi.\n\nThe Latin script, however, is the most commonly used in Brunei and Malaysia, both for official and informal purposes.\n\nHistorically, Malay has been written using various scripts. Before the introduction of Arabic script in the Malay region, Malay was written using the [[Pallava script|Pallava]], [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Rencong script|Rencong]] scripts; these are still in use today, such as the [[Cham alphabet]] used by the [[Chams]] of [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]. Old Malay was written using Pallava and Kawi script, as evident from several inscription stones in the Malay region. Starting from the era of kingdom of Pasai and throughout the golden age of the Malacca Sultanate, ''Jawi'' gradually replaced these scripts as the most commonly used script in the Malay region. Starting from the 17th century, under [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and British influence, Jawi was gradually replaced by the [[Malay alphabet|Rumi]] script.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/malay.htm |title=Malay (Bahasa Melayu) |website=Omniglot |access-date=30 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Extent of use ==\n{{See also|Malay trade and creole languages}}\n[[File:Malaysia Traffic-signs Warning-and-regulatory-signs-02.jpg|thumb|right|A Malay traffic sign in Malaysia.]]\n[[File:Sukarno hatta airport - Terminal - Jakarta - Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|Malay road signs in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. \"''Lajur Khusus Menurunkan Penumpang''\" means \"Lane for dropping passengers\" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]]]\nMalay is spoken in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[East Timor]], [[Singapore]], parts of [[Thailand]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brudirect.com/index.php/2010102331853/Local-News/malay-can-be-language-of-asean.html |title=Malay Can Be 'Language Of Asean' |date=24 October 2010 |publisher=Brudirect.com |access-date=22 December 2010}}</ref> and southern [[Philippines]].

[[English language|English]] continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country's large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.

Nouns and verbs may be basic roots, but frequently they are [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] from other words by means of [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[circumfix]]es.\n\nMalay does not make use of [[grammatical gender]], and there are only a few words that use natural gender; the same word is used for \u201c''he\u201d'' and \u201c''she\u201d'' which is ''dia'' or for \u201c''his\u201d'' and \u201c''her\u201d'' which is ''dia punya.'' There is no grammatical plural in Malay either; thus ''orang'' may mean either \"person\" or \"people\". Verbs are not [[inflected language|inflected]] for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as \"yesterday\") or by other tense indicators, such as ''sudah'' \"already\" and ''belum'' \"not yet\". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote [[voice (grammar)|voice]] or intentional and accidental [[grammatical mood|moods]].\n\nMalay does not have a [[grammatical subject]] in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and an [[object (grammar)|object]], these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Borrowed words==\n{{Main|List of Malay loanwords}}\n{{sect-stub|date=July 2019}}\nThe Malay language has many words borrowed from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (in particular religious terms), [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Sinitic languages]] (due to historical status of Malay Archipelago as a trading hub)  and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).\n\n==Varieties and related languages==\n{{main|Malayic languages}}\n{{noref-section|date=May 2019}}\nThere is a group closely related languages spoken by [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and related peoples across [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Southern Thailand]], and the far southern parts of the [[Philippines]]. They have traditionally been classified as Malay, Para-Malay, and Aboriginal Malay, but this reflects geography and ethnicity rather than a proper linguistic classification. The Malayan languages are [[mutually intelligible]] to varying extents, though the distinction between language and dialect is unclear in many cases.\n\nPara-Malay includes the Malayan languages of [[Sumatra]]. They are: [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]], [[Central Malay]] (Bengkulu), [[Pekal language|Pekal]], [[Musi language|Musi]] (Palembang), [[Negeri Sembilan Malay|Negeri Sembilan]] (Malaysia), and [[Duano language|Duano\u2019]].<ref>''Ethnologue'' 16 also lists Col, Haji, Kaur, Kerinci, Kubu, Lubu'.</ref>\n\nAboriginal Malay are the Malayan languages spoken by the [[Orang Asli]] ([[Proto-Malay]]) in [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]]. They are [[Jakun language|Jakun]], [[Orang Kanaq language|Orang Kanaq]], [[Orang Seletar language|Orang Seletar]], and [[Temuan language|Temuan]].\n\nThe other Malayan languages, included in neither of these groups, are associated with the expansion of the Malays across the archipelago. They include [[Malay language|Malaccan Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Kedah Malay]], [[Brunei Malay|Kedayan/Brunei Malay]], [[Berau Malay]], [[Bangka Malay]], [[Jambi Malay]], [[Kutai Malay]], [[Orang Laut language|Loncong]], [[Pattani Malay]], and [[Banjar language|Banjarese]]. [[Menterap language|Menterap]] may belong here. \n\nThere are also several [[Malay-based creole languages]], such as [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Cocos Malay]], [[Manado Malay]] and [[Sabah Malay]], which may be more or less distinct from standard (Malaccan) Malay.\n\nDue to the early settlement of a [[Cape Malay]] community in [[Cape Town]], who are now known as [[Coloured]]s, numerous [[History of the Malay language#Classical Malay|Classical Malay]] words were brought into [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]. \n===Usages===\nThe extent to which Malay and related Malayan languages are used in the countries where it is spoken varies depending on historical and cultural circumstances. Malay is the national language in Malaysia by [[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 152|Article 152]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], and became the sole official language in [[West Malaysia]] in 1968, and in [[East Malaysia]] gradually from 1974. [[English language|English]] continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country's large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.\n[https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahasa_Melayu_Kupang Kupang Malay]\nIn Singapore, Malay was historically the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among people of different nationalities. Although this has largely given way to English, Malay still retains the status of national language and the [[national anthem]], [[Majulah Singapura]], is entirely in Malay. In addition, parade commands in the military, police and civil defence are given only in Malay.\n\nMost residents of the five southernmost provinces of [[Thailand]]\u2014a region that, for the most part, used to be part of an ancient Malay kingdom called [[Pattani kingdom|Pattani]] &mdash; speak a dialect of Malay called [[Yawi language|Yawi]] (not to be confused with Jawi), which is similar to Kelantanese Malay, but the language has no official status or recognition.\n\nOwing to earlier contact with the [[Philippines]], Malay words\u2014such as ''dalam hati'' (sympathy), ''luwalhati'' (glory), ''tengah hari'' (midday), ''sedap'' (delicious) &mdash;  have evolved and been integrated into [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and other [[languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].\n\nBy contrast, Indonesian has successfully become the ''lingua franca'' for its disparate islands and ethnic groups, in part because the colonial language, Dutch, is no longer commonly spoken. (In [[East Timor]], which was governed as a province of Indonesia from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian is widely spoken and recognized under its [[Constitution]] as a 'working language'.)\n\nBesides [[Indonesia language|Indonesian]], which developed from the [[Malacca sultanate|Malaccan]]<!--not Riau: \"Riau Malay\" is not the Malay native to Riau, but to Malacca--> dialect, there are many Malay varieties spoken in Indonesia, they are divided into western and eastern groups. Western Malay dialects are predominantly spoken in [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]], which itself is divided into Bornean and Sumatran Malay, some of the most widely spoken Sumatran Malay dialects are [[Riau|Riau Malay]], [[Langkat]], [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] and [[Jambi Malay]]. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Kerinci people|Kerinci]] and [[Bengkulu]] are believed to be Sumatran Malay descendants. Meanwhile, the [[Jakarta]] dialect (known as [[Betawi language|Betawi]]) also belongs to the western Malay group.\n\nThe eastern varieties, classified either as dialects or [[Malay trade and creole languages|creoles]], are spoken in the easternmost part of the Indonesian archipelago and include: [[Manado Malay]], [[Ambonese Malay]], [[Kupang Malay]], [[North Moluccan Malay]], [[Papuan Malay]].\n \nThe differences among both groups are quite observable. For example, the word 'kita' means \"we, us\" in western, but means \"I, me\" in Manado, whereas \"we, us\" in Manado is 'torang' and Ambon 'katong' (originally abbreviated from Malay 'kita orang' (means \"we people\"). Another difference is the lack of possessive pronouns (and suffixes) in eastern dialects. Manado uses the verb 'pe' and Ambon 'pu' (from Malay 'punya', meaning \"to have\") to mark possession. So \"my name\" and \"our house\" are translated in western Malay as 'namaku' and 'rumah kita' but 'kita pe nama' and 'torang pe rumah' in Manado and 'beta pu nama', 'katong pu rumah' in Ambon dialect.\n\nThe pronunciation may vary in western dialects, especially the pronunciation of words ending in the vowel 'a'. For example, Malaysian pronounce 'kita' (inclusive we, us, our) as /kit\u0259/, Kelantan and Southern Thailand as /kit\u0254/, Riau as /kita/, Palembang as /kito/, Betawi and Perak as /kit\u025b/.\n\nBatavian and eastern dialects are sometimes regarded as Malay creole, because the speakers are not ethnically Malay.\n\n==Examples==\n\nAll Malay speakers should be able to understand either of the translations below, which differ mostly in their choice of wording. The words for 'article', ''pasal'' and ''perkara'', and for 'declaration', ''pernyataan'' and ''perisytiharan'', are specific to the Indonesian and Malaysian standards, respectively, but otherwise all the words are found in both (and even those words may be found with slightly different meanings). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n!

It is also used as a trading language in the southern [[Philippines]], including the southern parts of the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and the southern predominantly [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]]-inhabited municipalities of [[Bataraza]] and [[Balabac, Palawan|Balabac]] in [[Palawan]].\n\nAs the {{lang|ms|Bahasa Kebangsaan}} or {{lang|ms|Bahasa Nasional}} (\"national language\") of several states, Standard Malay has various official names. In Malaysia, it is designated as either {{lang|ms|Bahasa Malaysia}} (\"[[Malaysian language]]\") or {{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}} (\"Malay language\"). In Singapore and Brunei, it is called {{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}} (\"Malay language\") and in Indonesia, an autonomous normative variety called {{lang|ms|Bahasa Indonesia}} (\"[[Indonesian language]]\") is designated the {{lang|ms|Bahasa Persatuan/Pemersatu}} (\"unifying language\"/[[lingua franca]]). However, in areas of central to southern [[Sumatra]] where vernacular varieties of Malay are indigenous, Indonesians refer to it as {{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}} and consider it one of their regional languages.\n\nStandard Malay, also called Court Malay, was the literary standard of the pre-colonial [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] and [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] Sultanates, and so the language is sometimes called Malacca, Johor or Riau Malay (or various combinations of those names) to distinguish it from the various other [[Malayan languages]]. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'' 16, several of the Malayan varieties they currently list as separate languages, including the {{lang|ms|[[Orang Asli]]}} varieties of Peninsular Malay, are so closely related to standard Malay that they may prove to be dialects. There are also several [[Malay trade and creole languages]] which are based on a lingua franca derived from Classical Malay as well as [[Malay trade and creole languages#Macassar Malay|Macassar Malay]], which appears to be a [[mixed language]].\n\n==Origin==\n\nMalay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malay homeland being in western [[Borneo]] stretching to the [[Brunei]]an coast.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Adelaar |first=K.

A literary language was established in [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. After the defeat of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1511, the literary center shifted to the [[Johor-Riau Sultanate]], and the literary language is therefore often called Johor-Riau Malay, though it is a continuation of Malacca Malay. When Johor was divided between [[British Malaya]] ([[Johor]]) and the [[Dutch East Indies]] ([[Riau]]), its language was accorded official status in both territories.\n\nIndonesia pronounced \"Riau\" (Malacca\u2013Johor) Malay its official language (''Bahasa Indonesia'') when it gained independence. Since 1928, nationalists and young people throughout the Indonesian archipelago had declared Malay to be Indonesia's only official language, as proclaimed in the ''[[Sumpah Pemuda]]'' \"Youth Vow.\" Thus Indonesia was the first country to designate Malay as an official language.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IDS Languages of Indonesia (Sumatra)]</ref>\n\nIn Malaysia, the 1957 [[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 152|Article 152]] of the Federation adopted Johor (Malacca) Malay as the official language (''Bahasa Malaysia''). The name \"Malaysia\", in both language and country, emphasised that the nation consisted of more than just ethnic [[Malay people|Malays]]. In 1986 the official name was changed to ''Bahasa Melayu'', but in 2007 it was changed back.<ref>[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/bm/news.php?id=294230 Penggunaan Istilah Bahasa Malaysia Dan Bukan Bahasa Melayu Muktamad, Kata Zainuddin]. BERNAMA, 5 November 2007</ref>\n\n\"Bahasa Melayu\" was defined as Brunei's official language in the country's 1959 Constitution. It is also based on the Malaccan standard.\n\nThe Indonesian and Malaysian [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s of Malay are separated by some centuries of different vocabulary development (see [[Differences between Malaysian and Indonesian]]; cf. [[Serbo-Croatian]]). This is, in part, partly due to the influence of different colonial languages; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the case of Indonesia (see [[Dutch East Indies]]), and [[English language|English]] in the case of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, which were formerly under [[British Empire|British rule]]. However, Indonesia and Malaysia largely unified their previously divergent orthographies in 1972, and they along with Brunei have set up a joint commission to develop common scientific and technical vocabulary and otherwise co-operate to keep their standards convergent.\n\nSome Malay [[dialect]]s, however, show only limited [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language; for example, [[Kelantan Malay language|Kelantanese]] or [[Sarawak Malay|Sarawakian]] pronunciation is difficult for many fellow Malaysians to understand, while [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] contains many words unfamiliar to speakers of Malaysian, some because of [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] or other [[Languages of Indonesia|local language]] influence, and some because of the independent development of [[Indonesian slang language|Indonesian slang]] and colloquial parlance.\n\nThe language spoken by the [[Peranakan]] (Straits Chinese, a hybrid of Chinese settlers from the [[Ming Dynasty]] and local Malays) is a unique [[patois]] of Malay and the [[Hokkien Chinese]], which is mostly spoken in the former [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]] in Malaysia, and the Indonesian Archipelago. -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lawah-Lawah Merah (1875).pdf|thumb|''Lawah-Lawah Merah'' (1875), a Malay-language translation of ''L'araign\u00e9e rouge'' by {{ill|Ren\u00e9 de Pont-Jest|fr}} has been identified as the first Malay-language novel.

The laws were for the [[Minangkabau people]], who today still live in the highlands of [[Sumatra]].\n\nThe Malay language came into widespread use as the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] (1402\u20131511). During this period, the Malay language developed rapidly under the influence of Islamic literature. The development changed the nature of the language with massive infusion of [[Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]] vocabularies, called ''Classical Malay''. Under the Sultanate of Malacca the language evolved into a form recognisable to speakers of modern Malay. When the court moved to establish the Johor Sultanate, it continued using the classical language; it has become so associated with Dutch Riau and British Johor that it is often assumed that the Malay of Riau is close to the classical language. However, there is no closer connection between Malaccan Malay as used on Riau and the Riau vernacular.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sneddon|first=James N.|title=The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&pg=PA70|year=2003|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-598-8|page=70}}</ref>\n\nAmong the oldest surviving letters written in Malay are the letters from Sultan Abu Hayat of [[Ternate]], [[Maluku Islands]] in present-day Indonesia, dated around 1521\u20131522.

[[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], a geographic outlier spoken in [[Madagascar]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], is also a member of this language family. Although these languages are not necessarily mutually intelligible to any extent, their similarities are rather striking. Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, [[Proto-Austronesian language]]. There are many [[cognate]]s found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.\n\nWithin Austronesian, Malay is part of a cluster of numerous closely related [[variety (linguistics)|forms of speech]] known as the [[Malayic languages]], which were spread across Malaya and the Indonesian archipelago by Malay traders from Sumatra. There is disagreement as to which varieties of speech popularly called \"Malay\" should be considered dialects of this language, and which should be classified as distinct Malay languages. The [[vernacular]] of Brunei\u2014[[Brunei Malay]]\u2014for example, is not readily intelligible with the [[standard language]], and the same is true with some lects on the Malay Peninsula such as [[Kedah Malay]]. However, both Brunei and Kedah are quite close.<ref>''[[Ethnologue]]'' 16 classifies them as distinct languages, ISO3 ''kxd'' and ''meo'', but states that they \"are so closely related that they may one day be included as dialects of Malay\".</ref>\n\nThe closest relatives of the Malay languages are those left behind on Sumatra, such as the [[Minangkabau language]], with 5.5 million speakers on the west coast.\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Malay alphabet}}\n[[File:Kerinci MSS detail.jpg|thumb|The [[Rencong alphabet]], a native writing system found in Malay Peninsula, central and [[South Sumatra]]. The text reads (Voorhoeve's spelling): \"haku manangis ma / njaru ka'u ka'u di / saru tijada da / tang [hitu hadik sa]\", which is translated by Voorhoeve as: \"I am weeping, calling you; though called, you do not come\" (hitu adik sa- is the rest of 4th line.]]\n[[File:KedukanBukit001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.04|[[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]], using [[Pallava alphabet]], is the oldest surviving specimen of the [[Old Malay]] language in [[South Sumatra]], Indonesia.]]\nMalay is now written using the [[Latin script]], known as ''Rumi'' in Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore or ''Latin'' in Indonesia, although an [[Arabic script]] called ''Arab Melayu'' or [[Jawi alphabet|''Jawi'']] also exists. Latin script is official in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Malay uses [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]].\n\n''Rumi'' and ''Jawi'' are co-official in [[Brunei]] only. Names of institutions and organisations have to use Jawi and Rumi (Latin) scripts. Jawi is used fully in schools, especially the Religious School, ''Sekolah Agama'', which is compulsory during the afternoon for Muslim students aged from around 6\u20137 up to 12\u201314.\n\nEfforts are currently being undertaken to preserve Jawi in rural areas of Malaysia, and students taking Malay language examinations in Malaysia have the option of answering questions using Jawi.\n\nThe Latin script, however, is the most commonly used in Brunei and Malaysia, both for official and informal purposes.\n\nHistorically, Malay has been written using various scripts. Before the introduction of Arabic script in the Malay region, Malay was written using the [[Pallava script|Pallava]], [[Kawi script|Kawi]] and [[Rencong script|Rencong]] scripts; these are still in use today, such as the [[Cham alphabet]] used by the [[Chams]] of [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]. Old Malay was written using Pallava and Kawi script, as evident from several inscription stones in the Malay region.

Nouns and verbs may be basic roots, but frequently they are [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] from other words by means of [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es and [[circumfix]]es.\n\nMalay does not make use of [[grammatical gender]], and there are only a few words that use natural gender; the same word is used for \u201c''he\u201d'' and \u201c''she\u201d'' which is ''dia'' or for \u201c''his\u201d'' and \u201c''her\u201d'' which is ''dia punya.'' There is no grammatical plural in Malay either; thus ''orang'' may mean either \"person\" or \"people\". Verbs are not [[inflected language|inflected]] for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as \"yesterday\") or by other tense indicators, such as ''sudah'' \"already\" and ''belum'' \"not yet\". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote [[voice (grammar)|voice]] or intentional and accidental [[grammatical mood|moods]].\n\nMalay does not have a [[grammatical subject]] in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and an [[object (grammar)|object]], these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Borrowed words==\n{{Main|List of Malay loanwords}}\n{{sect-stub|date=July 2019}}\nThe Malay language has many words borrowed from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (in particular religious terms), [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Sinitic languages]] (due to historical status of Malay Archipelago as a trading hub)  and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).\n\n==Varieties and related languages==\n{{main|Malayic languages}}\n{{noref-section|date=May 2019}}\nThere is a group closely related languages spoken by [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and related peoples across [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Southern Thailand]], and the far southern parts of the [[Philippines]]. They have traditionally been classified as Malay, Para-Malay, and Aboriginal Malay, but this reflects geography and ethnicity rather than a proper linguistic classification. The Malayan languages are [[mutually intelligible]] to varying extents, though the distinction between language and dialect is unclear in many cases.\n\nPara-Malay includes the Malayan languages of [[Sumatra]]. They are: [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]], [[Central Malay]] (Bengkulu), [[Pekal language|Pekal]], [[Musi language|Musi]] (Palembang), [[Negeri Sembilan Malay|Negeri Sembilan]] (Malaysia), and [[Duano language|Duano\u2019]].<ref>''Ethnologue'' 16 also lists Col, Haji, Kaur, Kerinci, Kubu, Lubu'.</ref>\n\nAboriginal Malay are the Malayan languages spoken by the [[Orang Asli]] ([[Proto-Malay]]) in [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]]. They are [[Jakun language|Jakun]], [[Orang Kanaq language|Orang Kanaq]], [[Orang Seletar language|Orang Seletar]], and [[Temuan language|Temuan]].\n\nThe other Malayan languages, included in neither of these groups, are associated with the expansion of the Malays across the archipelago. They include [[Malay language|Malaccan Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Kedah Malay]], [[Brunei Malay|Kedayan/Brunei Malay]], [[Berau Malay]], [[Bangka Malay]], [[Jambi Malay]], [[Kutai Malay]], [[Orang Laut language|Loncong]], [[Pattani Malay]], and [[Banjar language|Banjarese]]. [[Menterap language|Menterap]] may belong here. \n\nThere are also several [[Malay-based creole languages]], such as [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Cocos Malay]], [[Manado Malay]] and [[Sabah Malay]], which may be more or less distinct from standard (Malaccan) Malay.\n\nDue to the early settlement of a [[Cape Malay]] community in [[Cape Town]], who are now known as [[Coloured]]s, numerous [[History of the Malay language#Classical Malay|Classical Malay]] words were brought into [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]. \n===Usages===\nThe extent to which Malay and related Malayan languages are used in the countries where it is spoken varies depending on historical and cultural circumstances. Malay is the national language in Malaysia by [[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 152|Article 152]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], and became the sole official language in [[West Malaysia]] in 1968, and in [[East Malaysia]] gradually from 1974. [[English language|English]] continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country's large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.\n\nIn Singapore, Malay was historically the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among people of different nationalities. Although this has largely given way to English, Malay still retains the status of national language and the [[national anthem]], [[Majulah Singapura]], is entirely in Malay. In addition, parade commands in the military, police and civil defence are given only in Malay.\n\nMost residents of the five southernmost provinces of [[Thailand]]\u2014a region that, for the most part, used to be part of an ancient Malay kingdom called [[Pattani kingdom|Pattani]] &mdash; speak a dialect of Malay called [[Yawi language|Yawi]] (not to be confused with Jawi), which is similar to Kelantanese Malay, but the language has no official status or recognition.\n\nOwing to earlier contact with the [[Philippines]], Malay words\u2014such as ''dalam hati'' (sympathy), ''luwalhati'' (glory), ''tengah hari'' (midday), ''sedap'' (delicious) &mdash;  have evolved and been integrated into [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and other [[languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].\n\nBy contrast, Indonesian has successfully become the ''lingua franca'' for its disparate islands and ethnic groups, in part because the colonial language, Dutch, is no longer commonly spoken. (In [[East Timor]], which was governed as a province of Indonesia from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian is widely spoken and recognized under its [[Constitution]] as a 'working language'.)\n\nBesides [[Indonesia language|Indonesian]], which developed from the [[Malacca sultanate|Malaccan]]<!--not Riau: \"Riau Malay\" is not the Malay native to Riau, but to Malacca--> dialect, there are many Malay varieties spoken in Indonesia, they are divided into western and eastern groups. Western Malay dialects are predominantly spoken in [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]], which itself is divided into Bornean and Sumatran Malay, some of the most widely spoken Sumatran Malay dialects are [[Riau|Riau Malay]], [[Langkat]], [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] and [[Jambi Malay]]. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Kerinci people|Kerinci]] and [[Bengkulu]] are believed to be Sumatran Malay descendants. Meanwhile, the [[Jakarta]] dialect (known as [[Betawi language|Betawi]]) also belongs to the western Malay group.\n\nThe eastern varieties, classified either as dialects or [[Malay trade and creole languages|creoles]], are spoken in the easternmost part of the Indonesian archipelago and include: [[Manado Malay]], [[Ambonese Malay]], [[North Moluccan Malay]], [[Papuan Malay]].\n \nThe differences among both groups are quite observable. For example, the word 'kita' means \"we, us\" in western, but means \"I, me\" in Manado, whereas \"we, us\" in Manado is 'torang' and Ambon 'katong' (originally abbreviated from Malay 'kita orang' (means \"we people\"). Another difference is the lack of possessive pronouns (and suffixes) in eastern dialects. Manado uses the verb 'pe' and Ambon 'pu' (from Malay 'punya', meaning \"to have\") to mark possession. So \"my name\" and \"our house\" are translated in western Malay as 'namaku' and 'rumah kita' but 'kita pe nama' and 'torang pe rumah' in Manado and 'beta pu nama', 'katong pu rumah' in Ambon dialect.\n\nThe pronunciation may vary in western dialects, especially the pronunciation of words ending in the vowel 'a'. For example, Malaysian pronounce 'kita' (inclusive we, us, our) as /kit\u0259/, Kelantan and Southern Thailand as /kit\u0254/, Riau as /kita/, Palembang as /kito/, Betawi and Perak as /kit\u025b/.\n\nBatavian and eastern dialects are sometimes regarded as Malay creole, because the speakers are not ethnically Malay.\n\n==Examples==\n\nAll Malay speakers should be able to understand either of the translations below, which differ mostly in their choice of wording. The words for 'article', ''pasal'' and ''perkara'', and for 'declaration', ''pernyataan'' and ''perisytiharan'', are specific to the Indonesian and Malaysian standards, respectively, but otherwise all the words are found in both (and even those words may be found with slightly different meanings). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n!
