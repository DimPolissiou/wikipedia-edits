Following the [[Soviet submarine S-363|sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine]] deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite [[Soviet Union|the Soviets]] consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The [[Swedish submarine incidents|\"submarine hunts\"]], which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of \"evidence\" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine ''\"Vetenskapens v\u00e4rld\"'' (\"World of science\") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly \"submarine hunts\" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate H\u00e5kan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in [[Swedish krona|SEK]].<ref name=Staff>Aired 16 April 2012. \"[http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb,a1364145,1,f,-1/pb,a1364142,1,f,-1/pl,v,,2781791/sb,p102815,1,f,-1 SVT Vetenskapens V\u00e4rld: \"Ig Nobel\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427065553/http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb%2Ca1364145%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpb%2Ca1364142%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpl%2Cv%2C%2C2781791%2Fsb%2Cp102815%2C1%2Cf%2C-1 |date=27 April 2012}}\" (in Swedish).

Following the [[Soviet submarine S-363|sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine]] deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite [[Soviet Union|the Soviets]] consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The [[Swedish submarine incidents|\"submarine hunts\"]], which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of \"evidence\" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine ''\"Vetenskapens v\u00e4rld\"'' (\"World of science\") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly \"submarine hunts\" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate H\u00e5kan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in [[Swedish krona|SEK]].<ref name=Staff>Aired 16 April 2012. \"[http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb,a1364145,1,f,-1/pb,a1364142,1,f,-1/pl,v,,2781791/sb,p102815,1,f,-1 SVT Vetenskapens V\u00e4rld: \"Ig Nobel\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427065553/http://svtplay.se/v/2773069/vetenskapens_varld/ig_nobel?cb%2Ca1364145%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpb%2Ca1364142%2C1%2Cf%2C-1%2Fpl%2Cv%2C%2C2781791%2Fsb%2Cp102815%2C1%2Cf%2C-1 |date=27 April 2012}}\" (in Swedish).

Ne deriva un aumento della robustezza delle misurazioni ma anche l'emergere di revisioni significative per molti aggregati economici (lo stesso livello del Pil, il valore aggiunto settoriale, l'occupazione, ecc.).  Molte di queste innovazioni sono fondate sull'utilizzo di nuove fonti informative, provenienti dall'integrazione tra basi di dati amministrativi e dati di indagine (ad esempio la nuova base di informazioni per le statistiche strutturali di impresa). La disponibilit\u00e0 di basi informative pi\u00f9 ricche, che permettono un utilizzo massiccio di dati individuali relativi a imprese e lavoratori, ha contribuito in maniera determinante al ridisegno delle procedure di stima di due degli elementi centrali dei conti nazionali: il modello di definizione dell'input di lavoro e i metodi di misura dell'economia non-osservata e, in particolare, della componente connessa con la sotto dichiarazione dell'attivit\u00e0 economica da parte della imprese |language=it}}</ref>\n*'''Medicine''': Ian Humphreys, Sonal Saraiya, Walter Belenky and James Dworkin, for treating \"uncontrollable\" nosebleeds, using the method of nasal-packing-with-strips-of-cured-pork.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000348941112001107|title=Nasal Packing with Strips of Cured Pork as Treatment for Uncontrollable Epistaxis in a Patient with Glanzmann Thrombasthenia|journal=Annals of Otology, Rhinology, and Laryngology|volume=120|issue=11|pages=732\u2013736|year=2011|last1=Humphreys|first1=I.|last2=Saraiya|first2=S.|last3=Belenky|first3=W.|last4=Dworkin|first4=J. |pmid=22224315 }}</ref>\n*'''Neuroscience''': Jiangang Liu, Jun Li, Lu Feng, Ling Li, Shubham Bose, Jie Tian, and Kang Lee, for trying to understand what happens in the brains of people who [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena|see the face of Jesus in a piece of toast]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2014.01.013|pmid=24583223|pmc=3980010|title=Seeing Jesus in toast: Neural and behavioral correlates of face pareidolia|journal=Cortex|volume=53|pages=60\u201377|year=2014|last1=Liu |first1=J. |last2=Li |first2=J. |last3=Feng |first3=L. |last4=Li |first4=L. |last5=Tian |first5=J. |last6=Lee |first6=K. }}</ref>\n*'''Nutrition''': Raquel Rubio, Anna Jofr\u00e9, Bel\u00e9n Mart\u00edn, Teresa Aymerich, and Margarita Garriga, for their study titled \"Characterization of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Infant Faeces as Potential Probiotic Starter Cultures for Fermented Sausages.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fm.2013.07.015|pmid=24290655|title=Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=38|pages=303\u2013311|year=2014|last1=Rubio |first1=R. |last2=Jofr\u00e9 |first2=A. |last3=Mart\u00edn |first3=B.

This bamboo is suitable for hedges and live fences since the stems and foliage form a dense growth that create an effective barrier. The height of the stems under ideal conditions is about 10 ft. Propagation is through rhizome offsets and rooted culm (stem) cuttings. Micro propagation too is feasible through axillary bud proliferation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3339098}}\n\n[[Category:Bambusa|multiplex]]\n[[Category:Indomalayan realm flora]]\n[[Category:Flora of Indo-China]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeast China]]\n[[Category:Flora of Bhutan]]\n[[Category:Flora of Nepal]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Flora of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Flora of South-Central China]]\n[[Category:Flora of Hainan]]\n[[Category:Flora of Assam (region)]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1832]]\n\n\n{{Bamboo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of plant}}\n{{Speciesbox\n|image = Bambusa multiplex.JPG\n|image_caption = at Kerala Forest Research Institute<br>Veluppadam, Kerala, India\n|genus = Bambusa\n|species = multiplex\n|authority =  (Lour.)

This bamboo is suitable for hedges and live fences since the stems and foliage form a dense growth that create an effective barrier. The height of the stems under ideal conditions is about 10 ft. Propagation is through rhizome offsets and rooted culm (stem) cuttings. Micro propagation too is feasible through axillary bud proliferation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3339098}}\n\n[[Category:Bambusa|multiplex]]\n[[Category:Indomalayan realm flora]]\n[[Category:Flora of Indo-China]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeast China]]\n[[Category:Flora of Bhutan]]\n[[Category:Flora of Nepal]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Flora of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Flora of South-Central China]]\n[[Category:Flora of Hainan]]\n[[Category:Flora of Assam (region)]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1832]]\n\n\n{{Bamboo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "The Eloquent Peasant", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed line breaks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusa_multiplex"}
