Founded in 1889, they are also known as ''The Jags'' and play their football at [[Victoria Park, Buckie|Victoria Park]], [[Buckie]].\n\n== History ==\n{{recentism|date=November 2014}}\nAlthough there is no accurate date for Buckie Thistle's formation, it is widely accepted that the club was formed in 1889. The early years saw the club play a number of challenge matches before being accepted into the ''Banff and District League''. <br>\nIt was not until the 1909\u201310 season that Buckie Thistle joined the Highland League, becoming the first team from [[Banffshire]] to be accepted into the league, with [[Morayshire]] having been represented for several years by [[Forres Mechanics F.C.|Forres Mechanics]] and [[Elgin City F.C.|Elgin City]]. Buckie have since gone on to win eleven league titles as well as numerous cup competitions, although they had to wait fifty-two years between their eighth (1957\u201358) and ninth ([[2009\u201310 Highland Football League|2009\u201310]]) title wins.\n\nBuckie Thistle's first-choice kit is identical to that of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic's]] green and white hoops, and local legend has it that Celtic donated the strips to the club.\nIn 1989 Celtic came north to play a friendly to mark ''The Jags'' centenary year and earlier, at the start of the decade, had visited Victoria Park to play in a fund-raising match for the spires appeal of St. Peters RC Church, Buckie.\n\nThe 1950s was a decade when all trophies available were won with regularity. It was during this era that Buckie Thistle travelled to [[Hampden Park]] to meet [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] in a [[1954\u201355 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup 4th round replay]] on 30 October 1954, prevailing 2\u20131<ref name=\"btfc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scotcuphistfull.html#55 |title=Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 Cup Results 1873/74-1877/78 and 1889/90-1995/96 |publisher=Dinant Abbink/RSSSF |accessdate=2008-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023163026/http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scotcuphistfull.html#55 |archivedate=23 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> and thus becoming the first \u2013 and still only \u2013 senior non-league club to have won a competitive match at the national stadium.\n<br>\nThe ambitious club board has extensively developed the stadium in recent years, with a function hall being built within the perimeter of the ground, enabling sponsors and spectators to enjoy licensed and catering facilities pre- and post-match at the venue.<ref name=\"btfc-func\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buckiethistle.com/scottish-football/265/victoria-park-function-hall.html|title=Victoria Park Function Hall|publisher=Buckie Thistle FC|accessdate=2008-11-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914065957/http://www.buckiethistle.com/scottish-football/265/victoria-park-function-hall.html|archivedate=14 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 2007\u201308 ===\nBuckie Thistle bolstered their squad for the 2007\u201308 season with the signings of Craig MacMillan, Tony Low, Graeme Stewart, David Macrae, Brian Neill, Bob Duncan and Andrew Courage. The Jags started the season as one of the favourites to win the league title for the first time in 50 years and managed to live up to this tag early on with an opening day victory over [[Fraserburgh F.C.|Fraserburgh]] followed by a first round win away to [[Cove Rangers F.C.|Cove Rangers]] in the Aberdeenshire Cup. Buckie went on to lift the [[Aberdeenshire Cup]] with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Keith F.C.|Keith]] in the final after beating rivals [[Deveronvale F.C.|Deveronvale]] in the semi-final.\n\nBuckie went on to complete the Aberdeenshire Double by winning the Shield with a 3\u20130 victory over [[Inverurie Loco Works F.C.|Inverurie Loco Works]] in the final, having defeated Fraserburgh and [[Huntly F.C.|Huntly]] on the way to the final.\n\nIn their Scottish Cup campaign, Buckie started off with a 2\u20131 victory away to [[Glasgow University F.C.|Glasgow University]] in the first round. It was the first year that all Highland League sides entered the Scottish Cup proper without having to qualify and Buckie looked to make the most of the opportunity to go far. The Jags progressed to the Third Round of the competition after defeating Highland League rivals [[Nairn County F.C.|Nairn County]] 4\u20131. Thistle were then handed a tough tie against [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] side [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. After going 2\u20130 down early they fought back to 2\u20132, only for Morton to score a last minute winner and knock Buckie out of the cup.\n\nAfter a good start to the league campaign, the second half of the season went less well after going out of the Scottish Cup. Buckie failed to beat fellow title rivals such as Keith and Cove Rangers and this ultimately ended their title hopes. Craig MacMillan was Buckie's top goalscorer in 2007\u201308, scoring 21 goals, while Stephen Bruce scored a total of 11 goals.\n\nOn 20 April 2008, former [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international Striker [[Duncan Shearer]] was sacked as manager of Buckie Thistle. Shearer was sacked just one day after a home defeat to Cove Rangers which all but ended Thistle's hopes of winning the league championship. During Shearer's reign as manager he managed to win the Aberdeenshire Cup twice and the Aberdeenshire Shield once.\n\nOn 13 May 2008 Kevin and Doug Will were revealed as Buckie Thistle's new management team for a second spell.\n\n=== Season 2008\u201309 ===\nEarly transfer activity in what was the Wills second spell in charge saw Graeme Stewart leaving for Inverurie Locos before striker Charlie Brown arrived from Forres Mechanics. In addition Iain Good and Donnie Monro (returning to the club) were brought in from Peterhead and Martin Charlesworth from Elgin City. A late arrival to the club saw 23-year-old defender Stuart Cumming sign from [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]] in September.\n\nOn 17 October, Buckie Thistle announced the sacking of Kevin and Doug Will after a start to the season which saw the club fall 15 points behind in the league and get knocked out of the Challenge Cup, Aberdeenshire Cup and Aberdeenshire Shield. The 3\u20131 defeat to Junior Side [[Banks O'Dee F.C.|Banks O'Dee]] in the Aberdeenshire Shield was their final game in charge.\n\nBuckie appointed Gregg Carrol as manager on 21 October. Carrol had in fact already been offered the job back in May but had rejected it. Carrol was unable to prevent a 3\u20130 defeat to [[Lochee United F.C.|Lochee United]] in his first game in charge in the Scottish Cup. Buckie then suffered a 3\u20132 defeat to [[Clachnacuddin F.C.|Clachnacuddin]] in the league before embarking on a nine-game winning streak, including wins over rivals Deveronvale and a 7\u20131 victory over Fort William leading them to be in contention for the title.\n\n=== Season 2009\u201310 ===\nDespite losing their opening two league games, Buckie went on to win the League Championship for the first time in 52 years, clinching the title on 1 May following a 3\u20130 win at [[Wick Academy FC|Wick Academy]]. In addition they also won the Aberdeenshire Cup beating Cove Rangers 2\u20130 in September 2009, with both goals being scored by Stephen Bruce.\n\n=== Season 2010\u201311 ===\nOn 7 May 2011, Buckie defeated their local rivals and nearest challengers Deveronvale 2\u20131 at Victoria Park to clinch the title for the second year in succession. Goals from Martin Charlesworth and Andy Low overturned an opening goal by Mark Chisholm.\nThis is the first time that the Jags have won back to back titles since 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358.\nIn addition to retaining the League championship the club were runners up in the Aberdeenshire Cup, this time losing to Cove Rangers and reached the fifth round of the Scottish Cup narrowly losing 2\u20130 to Brechin City.\n\n=== Season 2011\u201312 ===\nThe club entered the [[2011\u201312 Scottish Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] for the first time, and were drawn away to [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]] in the first round. They lost 5\u20134 on penalties following a very creditable 1\u20131 draw.\nThe season ended on a high note when the club won the Highland League Cup, beating [[Cove Rangers F.C.|Cove Rangers]] 2\u20130 at Banff.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13671944.stm|title=Highland duo enter new Ramsdens Cup|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=6 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, they couldn't make it three Highland League titles in a row, as they finished fifth. The title was won by [[Forres Mechanics F.C.|Forres Mechanics]].\n\nIt was officially announced on 4 June 2012 that Gregg Carroll had resigned his post as Buckie Thistle manager and retired from football. He was replaced by his former assistant Gary Hake and then by Graeme Stewart who is the current manager.<ref>{{cite web

{"title_page": "Anti-sweatshop movement", "text_new": "'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' is a Norwegian reality TV show about three fashion bloggers investigating the sweatshop issue in the fashion industry. The three glamorous fashion bloggers, Frida, Ludvig and Anniken, gave up their glam-life in Norway and went to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month to see the reality of the conditions of people who make their clothes. The journey begins to question the poor standards of the working conditions that keep up with the massive manufacturing of clothing for people stay trendy. ''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' was released in ten minute episodes online on 19 January 2015. The show raises an awareness on the current issue of sweatshops in the clothing industry through advocacy from famous people in the fashion industry such as fashion bloggers.\n\n== #WhoMadeMyClothes ==\nThe #WhoMadeMyClothes hashtag was launched in 2013 by Fashion Revolution co-founders, Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blanchard|first=Tamsin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/commentisfree/2019/apr/22/who-made-my-clothes-stand-up-for-workers-rights-with-fashion-revolution-week|title=Who Made My Clothes?

To promote the hashtag in 2015, Fashion Revolution released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views.

This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years.

It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Related reality TV show ==\n''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' is a Norwegian reality TV show about three fashion bloggers investigating the sweatshop issue in the fashion industry.

This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] - international alliance of labor unions and non-governmental organizations\n* [[Coalition qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contre les ateliers de mis\u00e8re]] - a Qu\u00e9bec anti-sweatshop coalition based in Montr\u00e9al\n* [[Free the Children]] - a Canadian organization that helps raise awareness and put a stop to Child Labour \u2013 Also helps other children in need\n* [[Global Exchange]] - an international human rights organization founded in 1988 dedicated to promoting social, economic and environmental justice\n* [[Green America]] - membership organization based in the United States\n* [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] - founded to combat sweatshop labor and US government policy in El Salvador and Central America\n* [[International Labor Rights Forum]]\n* [[International Labour Organization]] - a specialized agency of the United Nations\n* [[Maquila Solidarity Network]] - a Canadian anti-sweatshop network\n* [[Rugmark]] - a carpet labeling program and rehabilitation centers for former child laborers in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n* [[SweatFree Communities]] - a nationwide network for local action against sweatshops\n* SweatsHope - an Australian/New Zealand organization to create a sweatshop free world and stop human trafficking\n* [[UNITE HERE]] - a labor union based in the United States and Canada dedicated to achieving higher standards for laborers \n* [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] - a student organization in the United States and Canada\n* [[Worker Rights Consortium]] - a labor rights organization focused on protecting the rights of workers who make apparel in the United States\n\n=== In Asia ===\n* [[Asia Monitor Resource Center]] - focuses on promoting democratic labor movements in Asia and the Pacific\n* [[China Labour Bulletin]] - reports on labor concerns in China\n* [[Chinese Working Women Network]] - supports and empowers Chinese migrant working women\n* [[Globalization Monitor]] - non-profit based in Hong Kong that promotes awareness on negative effects of globalization\n* [[Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee]] - empowers workers, acts as a policy watch-dog, and promotes independent trade union movements\n* [[No Sweat Shop Label and Homeworkers Code of Practice]] - corporate code of conduct to eliminate sweatshop conditions in Australia\n* [[Thai Labour Campaign]] - covers labor disputes, worker rights campaigns and labor law in Thailand\n* [[Transnationals Information Exchange]] - information on garment worker struggles in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n==Prominent campaigners==\n* [[Lady Astor]]\n* [[Alfred Deakin]]\n* [[Alfred George Gardiner]]\n* [[Vida Goldstein]]\n* [[Florence Kelley]]\n* [[Charles Kernaghan]]\n* [[Mary Reid Macarthur]]\n* [[Samuel Mauger]]\n* [[R.

Because of gummy sharks bottom dwelling habitat, they have minimal contact with humans, and they tend to flee when spotted, hence why observational studies of this species is difficult. Gummy sharks have only 2 known predators. One is humans, who catch them for consumption and sport-fishing<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.australia.com/en-us/things-to-do/adventure-and-sports/great-fishing-adventures/fly-deep-sea-and-sport-fishing.html|title=Fly, deep sea & sport fishing in Australia - Tourism Australia|last=Australia|first=Tourism|date=2020-03-10|website=www.australia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>.

It was the first tour with original members [[Peter Criss]] and [[Ace Frehley]] since their 1979 [[Dynasty Tour]]. The tour grossed $143.7 million, making it the most successful Kiss tour to date. Average attendance was 14,000.\n\nThe reunion tour prompted many 80's metal bands to also do reunion tours, however KISS' was the first and most successful.\n\nShows included the June 15 warmup gig in [[Irvine, California]], during which a stray firework ignited part of the stage; the August 8 show in [[Cincinnati]], where a fan threw his prosthetic leg on stage, which all the members signed and handed back to him; the January 22 show in [[Osaka]], Japan, where [[Gene Simmons]] lost his voice, [[Paul Stanley]] and Ace Frehley had to sing most of the songs; and the April 5 show in [[Columbus, Georgia]], where, due to health reasons, Peter Criss could not perform, and because the group decided to not cancel the show since the doors were already open, Criss's drum tech Eddie Kanon took the stage in Criss's \"cat\" make-up.\nThere was a short set played for MTV Music Awards before starting the US second leg, on September 4 at Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. Setlist for the show: \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" / \"[[New York Groove]]\" / \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\" / \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\" / \"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\".\n\nThe setlists for the tour drew almost exclusively from the band's 1970s heyday and did not include any songs from their non-make-up era. Only one song from the band's 1980s catalogue (\"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" from ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'') was played. The band did this because they believed that since they were touring with their original lineup, they should be faithful to the era with the material performed. {{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Alice in Chains]] were among many of the supporting acts on this tour. This would turn out to be their last tour featuring late vocalist [[Layne Staley]] with the final live appearance being on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus. Layne would never perform live again and lived in isolation until his death on April 5, 2002.\n\n==Typical setlist==\n\n#\"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\"\n#\"King of the Night Time World\"\n#\"Do You Love Me?\"\n#\"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\"\n#\"[[Cold Gin (song)|Cold Gin]]\"\n#\"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\"\n#\"[[Shout It Out Loud (Kiss song)|Shout It Out Loud]]\"\n#\"Watchin' You\"\n#\"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\"\n#\"[[Strutter]]\"\n#\"[[Shock Me]]\" (Ace Frehley guitar solo)\n#\"Rock Bottom\"\n#\"[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]\" (Gene Simmons bass solo, spits blood and flies), (Peter Criss drum solo)\n#\"[[New York Groove]]\"\n#\"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\"\n#\"100,000 Years\"\n#\"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\"\n'''Encore'''\n#<li value=18>\"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\"\n#\"[[Detroit Rock City]]\"\n#\"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\"\n\nOther songs played included \"Take Me\", \"I Stole Your Love\", \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\", \"[[C'mon and Love Me]]\", \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\", \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", and \"[[2,000 Man]]\".\n\n==Notable Shows==\n<ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997-0705.php</ref><ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-reunion-show/</ref><ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php</ref><ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-1995-mtv-vmas/</ref>\n\n'''June 15, 1996 KROQ Weenie Roast, Irvine Ca'''\n\nThis show was a practice gig for the band in front of a live audience before the official beginning of the tour. This show was for the band to work out the kinks in their complex live show. During the show multiple things went wrong, for example Ace Frehley's guitar went silent in the middle of the set. \n\n'''June 28, 1996 Tiger Stadium, Detroit Mi'''\n\nThis was the first official show with the reunited band in 17 years, and this was the show that kicked off the highly successful Alive Worldwide Tour. Initially the band wanted to start the tour off at a smaller venue, but their manager, Doc McGee booked the massive baseball stadium for the first gig. This ended up being a very fitting venue for the beginning of Kiss' comeback, because the city of Detroit always had special significance to the band, which is why Kiss wrote a song titled \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", which is one of their most well known songs, getting regular airplay on classic rock radio stations. The move to open the tour at Tiger Stadium in Detroit Rock City proved to be a good one, because the show sold out in a record time of 45 minutes, which is very impressive considering the fact that the band sold 39,867 tickets in under an hour without online ticket sales. \n\n'''June 25-28, 1996 Madison Square Garden, New York City Ny'''\n\nWhen the band went to schedule dates in their home town of New York City, they found out that just one night at the world famous Madison Square Garden arena was simply not enough, so they played four sold out consecutive nights at MSG and likely could have done another if the arena hadn't been occupied the next night. \n\n'''September 4, 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, Brooklyn Ny'''\n\nIn 1996 Kiss was riding on success as if it were 1977 again, and were scheduled to preform on the MTV Video Music Awards as a way to help further promote themselves, but in typical Kiss fashion, they weren't just going to play on any stage, they were intending on playing a show under the Statue of Liberty, but couldn't make a deal with the city of New York, so last minute the concert location was changed to a port right next to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Kiss played a 20 minute set to an audience of whoever showed up to watch them under the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge, however only the first song, Rock n Roll All Nite was broadcast on TV. Since the band was playing outdoors at an unofficial venue, without as many regulations, the band added loads of pyrotechnics, fireworks, and confetti. The complete show can be seen on Kiss' dvd boxset Kissology III.\n\n==Tour dates==\n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kissconcerthistory.com/ |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed |website=kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1996 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1997 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kissfanshop.de/Tourdates/TourdatesReunion.htm|title=KISS TOURDATES Alive Worldwide 1996\u201397|website=www.kissfanshop.de}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=tour:(Alive/Worldwide) |title=Search for setlists: tour:(Alive/Worldwide) &#124; setlist.fm |website=www.setlist.fm |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"175\"| Opening Act(s)\n! width=\"200\"| Attendance \n\n\n|-\n|June 15, 1996||[[Irvine, California]]||[[United States]]||[[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre]]  [[KROQ Weenie Roast]] || [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] || 15,416 *sold out*\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|North America \n|-\n|June 28, 1996||[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]||rowspan=\"24\"|United States||[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] || [[Alice in Chains]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] || 39,867 *sold out*\n|-\n|June 30, 1996||[[Louisville, Kentucky]]||[[Freedom Hall]] || rowspan=\"3\"|Alice in Chains || 15,891 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 2, 1996||[[St. Louis, Missouri]]||[[Kiel Center]] || 16,310 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 3, 1996||[[Kansas City, Missouri]]||[[Kemper Arena]] || 13,226 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 5, 1996||[[Dallas, Texas]]||[[Reunion Arena]] || rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pushmonkey]] || 14,637 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 6, 1996||[[Houston, Texas]]||[[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] || 12,955 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 7, 1996||[[San Antonio, Texas]]||[[Alamodome]] || 18,337 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 9, 1996||[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]||[[Louisiana Superdome]] || rowspan=\"5\"|[[The Melvins]] || 16,308 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 10, 1996||[[Memphis, Tennessee]]||[[Pyramid Arena]] || 16,807 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 12, 1996||[[Moline, Illinois]]||[[MARK of the Quad Cities]] || 10,349 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 13, 1996||[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]||[[St. Paul Civic Center]] || 15,234 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 14, 1996||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont, Illinois]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont Horizon]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || rowspan=\"3\"|[[The Nixons]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 17, 1996||[[Fairborn, Ohio]]||[[Ervin J.

It was the first tour with original members [[Peter Criss]] and [[Ace Frehley]] since their 1979 [[Dynasty Tour]]. The tour grossed $143.7 million, making it the most successful Kiss tour to date. Average attendance was 14,000.\n\nThe reunion tour prompted many 80's metal bands to also do reunion tours, however KISS' was the first and most successful.\n\nShows included the June 15 warmup gig in [[Irvine, California]], during which a stray firework ignited part of the stage; the August 8 show in [[Cincinnati]], where a fan threw his prosthetic leg on stage, which all the members signed and handed back to him; the January 22 show in [[Osaka]], Japan, where [[Gene Simmons]] lost his voice, [[Paul Stanley]] and Ace Frehley had to sing most of the songs; and the April 5 show in [[Columbus, Georgia]], where, due to health reasons, Peter Criss could not perform, and because the group decided to not cancel the show since the doors were already open, Criss's drum tech Eddie Kanon took the stage in Criss's \"cat\" make-up.\nThere was a short set played for MTV Music Awards before starting the US second leg, on September 4 at Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. Setlist for the show: \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\" / \"[[New York Groove]]\" / \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\" / \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\" / \"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\".\n\nThe setlists for the tour drew almost exclusively from the band's 1970s heyday and did not include any songs from their non-make-up era. Only one song from the band's 1980s catalogue (\"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" from ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'') was played. The band did this because they believed that since they were touring with their original lineup, they should be faithful to the era with the material performed. {{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n[[Alice in Chains]] were among many of the supporting acts on this tour. This would turn out to be their last tour featuring late vocalist [[Layne Staley]] with the final live appearance being on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus. Layne would never perform live again and lived in isolation until his death on April 5, 2002.\n\n==Typical setlist==\n\n#\"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\"\n#\"King of the Night Time World\"\n#\"Do You Love Me?\"\n#\"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\"\n#\"[[Cold Gin (song)|Cold Gin]]\"\n#\"[[Love Gun (song)|Love Gun]]\"\n#\"[[Shout It Out Loud (Kiss song)|Shout It Out Loud]]\"\n#\"Watchin' You\"\n#\"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\"\n#\"[[Strutter]]\"\n#\"[[Shock Me]]\" (Ace Frehley guitar solo)\n#\"Rock Bottom\"\n#\"[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]\" (Gene Simmons bass solo, spits blood and flies), (Peter Criss drum solo)\n#\"[[New York Groove]]\"\n#\"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\"\n#\"100,000 Years\"\n#\"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\"\n'''Encore'''\n#<li value=18>\"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\"\n#\"[[Detroit Rock City]]\"\n#\"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\"\n\nOther songs played included \"Take Me\", \"I Stole Your Love\", \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\", \"[[C'mon and Love Me]]\", \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\", \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", and \"[[2,000 Man]]\".\n\n==Notable Shows==\n<ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997-0705.php</ref><ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-reunion-show/</ref><ref>https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php</ref>\n\n'''June 15, 1996 KROQ Weenie Roast, Irvine Ca'''\n\nThis show was a practice gig for the band in front of a live audience before the official beginning of the tour. This show was for the band to work out the kinks in their complex live show. During the show multiple things went wrong, for example Ace Frehley's guitar went silent in the middle of the set. \n\n'''June 28, 1996 Tiger Stadium, Detroit Mi'''\n\nThis was the first official show with the reunited band in 17 years, and this was the show that kicked off the highly successful Alive Worldwide Tour. Initially the band wanted to start the tour off at a smaller venue, but their manager, Doc McGee booked the massive baseball stadium for the first gig. This ended up being a very fitting venue for the beginning of Kiss' comeback, because the city of Detroit always had special significance to the band, which is why Kiss wrote a song titled \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", which is one of their most well known songs, getting regular airplay on classic rock radio stations. The move to open the tour at Tiger Stadium in Detroit Rock City proved to be a good one, because the show sold out in a record time of 45 minutes, which is very impressive considering the fact that the band sold 39,867 tickets in under an hour without online ticket sales. \n\n'''June 25-28, 1996 Madison Square Garden, New York City Ny'''\n\nWhen the band went to schedule dates in their home town of New York City, they found out that just one night at the world famous Madison Square Garden arena was simply not enough, so they played four sold out consecutive nights at MSG and likely could have done another if the arena hadn't been occupied the next night. \n\n'''September 4, 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, Brooklyn Ny'''\n\nIn 1996 Kiss was riding on success as if it were 1977 again, and were scheduled to preform on the MTV Video Music Awards as a way to help further promote themselves, but in typical Kiss fashion, they weren't just going to play on any stage, they were intending on playing a show under the Statue of Liberty, but couldn't make a deal with the city of New York, so last minute the concert location was changed to a port right next to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Kiss played a 20 minute set to an audience of whoever showed up to watch them under the silhouette of the Brooklyn Bridge, however only the first song, Rock n Roll All Nite was broadcast on TV. Since the band was playing outdoors at an unofficial venue, without as many regulations, the band added loads of pyrotechnics, fireworks, and confetti. The complete show can be seen on Kiss' dvd boxset Kissology III.\n\n==Tour dates==\n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kissconcerthistory.com/ |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed |website=kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1996/1996.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1996 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kissconcerthistory.com/1997/1997.php |title=KISS Concert History Online \u2013 Decades on Tour Detailed: 1997 |website=www.kissconcerthistory.com |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kissfanshop.de/Tourdates/TourdatesReunion.htm|title=KISS TOURDATES Alive Worldwide 1996\u201397|website=www.kissfanshop.de}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=tour:(Alive/Worldwide) |title=Search for setlists: tour:(Alive/Worldwide) &#124; setlist.fm |website=www.setlist.fm |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"175\"| Opening Act(s)\n! width=\"200\"| Attendance \n\n\n|-\n|June 15, 1996||[[Irvine, California]]||[[United States]]||[[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre]]  [[KROQ Weenie Roast]] || [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] || 15,416 *sold out*\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|North America \n|-\n|June 28, 1996||[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]||rowspan=\"24\"|United States||[[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] || [[Alice in Chains]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] || 39,867 *sold out*\n|-\n|June 30, 1996||[[Louisville, Kentucky]]||[[Freedom Hall]] || rowspan=\"3\"|Alice in Chains || 15,891 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 2, 1996||[[St. Louis, Missouri]]||[[Kiel Center]] || 16,310 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 3, 1996||[[Kansas City, Missouri]]||[[Kemper Arena]] || 13,226 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 5, 1996||[[Dallas, Texas]]||[[Reunion Arena]] || rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pushmonkey]] || 14,637 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 6, 1996||[[Houston, Texas]]||[[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] || 12,955 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 7, 1996||[[San Antonio, Texas]]||[[Alamodome]] || 18,337 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 9, 1996||[[New Orleans, Louisiana]]||[[Louisiana Superdome]] || rowspan=\"5\"|[[The Melvins]] || 16,308 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 10, 1996||[[Memphis, Tennessee]]||[[Pyramid Arena]] || 16,807 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 12, 1996||[[Moline, Illinois]]||[[MARK of the Quad Cities]] || 10,349 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 13, 1996||[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]||[[St. Paul Civic Center]] || 15,234 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 14, 1996||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont, Illinois]]||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Rosemont Horizon]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || rowspan=\"3\"|[[The Nixons]] || 29,887 *sold out*\n|-\n|July 17, 1996||[[Fairborn, Ohio]]||[[Ervin J.
