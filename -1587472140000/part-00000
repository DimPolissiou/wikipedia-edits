It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters, after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner. His third daughter gets nothing, because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done.  When he feels he has been treated with disrespect by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power, he becomes furious to the point of madness. He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter, just before tragedy strikes her and then the king.\n\nDerived from the legend of [[Leir of Britain]], a mythological [[British Iron Age|pre-Roman]] Celtic king, the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures, with the title role coveted by many of the world's most accomplished actors.\n\nThe first attribution to Shakespeare of this play, originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on [[St. Stephen's Day]] in 1606, was a 1608 publication in a [[quarto]] of uncertain [[provenance]], in which the play is listed as a [[Shakespearean history|history]]; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text. ''The Tragedy of King Lear'', a revised version that is better tailored for performance, was included in the 1623 [[First Folio]]. Modern editors usually [[conflate]] the two, though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration]], the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone, but since the 19th century Shakespeare's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements. The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship. [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote \"No man will ever write a better tragedy than ''Lear''.\"{{sfn|Shaw|1961|p=111}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes}}\n* [[Leir of Britain|Lear]]{{snd}}King of Britain\n* Earl of Gloucester\n* Earl of Kent{{snd}}later disguised as Caius\n* [[Shakespearean fool|Fool]]{{snd}}Lear's fool\n* Edgar{{snd}}Gloucester's first-born son\n* [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]]{{snd}}Gloucester's illegitimate son\n* [[Goneril]]{{snd}}Lear's eldest daughter\n* [[Regan (King Lear)|Regan]]{{snd}}Lear's second daughter\n* [[Cordelia (King Lear)|Cordelia]]{{snd}}Lear's youngest daughter\n* Duke of Albany{{snd}}Goneril's husband\n* Duke of Cornwall{{snd}}Regan's husband\n* Gentleman{{snd}}attends Cordelia\n* Oswald{{snd}}Goneril's loyal steward\n* King of France{{snd}}suitor and later husband to Cordelia\n* Duke of Burgundy{{snd}}suitor to Cordelia\n* Old man{{snd}}tenant of Gloucester\n* Curan{{snd}}courtier\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Act II===\nEdmund learns from Curan, a courtier, that there is likely to be war between Albany and Cornwall and that Regan and Cornwall are to arrive at Gloucester's house that evening. Taking advantage of the arrival of the duke and Regan, Edmund fakes an attack by Edgar, and Gloucester is completely taken in. He disinherits Edgar and proclaims him an outlaw.\n\nBearing Lear's message to Regan, Kent meets Oswald again at Gloucester's home, quarrels with him again and is put in the stocks by Regan and her husband Cornwall. When Lear arrives, he objects to the mistreatment of his messenger, but Regan is as dismissive of her father as Goneril was. Lear is enraged but impotent. Goneril arrives and supports Regan's argument against him. Lear yields completely to his rage. He rushes out into a storm to rant against his ungrateful daughters, accompanied by the mocking Fool. Kent later follows to protect him. Gloucester protests against Lear's mistreatment. With Lear's retinue of a hundred knights dissolved, the only companions he has left are his Fool and Kent. Wandering on the [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] after the storm, Edgar, in the guise of a madman named [[Tom o' Bedlam]], meets Lear. Edgar babbles madly while Lear denounces his daughters. Kent leads them all to shelter.\n\n===Act III===\n[[File:Lear and the Fool III.ii.jpg|thumb|A watercolour of King Lear and the Fool in the storm from Act III, Scene ii, of ''King Lear'']]\nEdmund betrays Gloucester to Cornwall, Regan, and Goneril. He reveals evidence that his father knows of an impending French invasion designed to reinstate Lear to the throne; and in fact, a French army has landed in Britain. Once Edmund leaves with Goneril to warn Albany about the invasion, Gloucester is arrested, and Regan and Cornwall [[Eye-gouging|gouge out Gloucester's eyes]]. As they are doing this, a servant is overcome with rage by what he is witnessing and attacks Cornwall, mortally wounding him. Regan kills the servant and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him; then she turns him out to wander the heath, too.\n\n===Act IV===\nEdgar, in his madman's disguise, meets his blinded father on the heath. Gloucester, sightless and failing to recognise Edgar's voice, begs him to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience\u2014he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear and Gloucester\u2014and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan. After receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald that she is a more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off.\n\nOswald appears, still looking for Edmund. On Regan's orders, he tries to kill Gloucester but is killed by Edgar. In Oswald's pocket, Edgar finds Goneril's letter, in which she encourages Edmund to kill her husband and take her as his wife. Kent and Cordelia take charge of Lear, whose madness quickly passes. Regan, Goneril, Albany, and Edmund meet with their forces. Albany insists that they fight the French invaders but not harm Lear or Cordelia. The two sisters lust for Edmund, who has made promises to both. He considers the dilemma and plots the deaths of Albany, Lear, and Cordelia. Edgar gives Goneril's letter to Albany. The armies meet in battle, the British defeat the French, and Lear and Cordelia are captured. Edmund sends Lear and Cordelia off with secret-joint orders from him (representing Regan and her forces) and Goneril (representing the forces of her estranged husband, Albany) for the execution of Cordelia.\n\n===Act V===\n[[File:Lear and Cordelia (1849-54).jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Lear and Cordelia'' by [[Ford Madox Brown]]]]\n\nThe victorious British leaders meet, and the recently widowed Regan now declares she will marry Edmund. But Albany exposes the intrigues of Edmund and Goneril and proclaims Edmund a traitor. Regan falls ill, having been poisoned by Goneril, and is escorted offstage, where she dies. Edmund defies Albany, who calls for a [[trial by combat]]. Edgar appears masked and in armour and challenges Edmund to a duel. No one knows who he is. Edgar wounds Edmund fatally, though Edmund does not die immediately. Albany confronts Goneril with the letter which was intended to be his death warrant; she flees in shame and rage. Edgar reveals himself and reports that Gloucester died offstage from the shock and joy of learning that Edgar is alive, after Edgar revealed himself to his father.\n\nOffstage, Goneril, her plans thwarted, commits suicide. The dying Edmund decides, though he admits it is against his own character, to try to save Lear and Cordelia, but his confession comes too late. Soon after, Albany sends men to countermand Edmund's orders. Lear enters bearing Cordelia's corpse in his arms, having survived by killing the executioner. Kent appears and Lear now recognises him. Albany urges Lear to resume his throne, but as with Gloucester, the trials Lear has been through have finally overwhelmed him, and he dies. Albany then asks Kent and Edgar to take charge of the throne. Kent declines, explaining that his master is calling him on a journey and he must follow. Finally, Albany (in the quarto version) or Edgar (in the folio version) implies that he will now become king.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:1577 printing of Holinshed's Chronicles.jpg|thumb|The first edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande'', printed in 1577.]]\nShakespeare's play is based on various accounts of the semi-legendary [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] figure [[Leir of Britain]], whose name has been linked by some scholars to the Brythonic god [[Lir]]/[[Ll\u0177r]], though in actuality the names are not etymologically related.{{sfn|Jackson|1953|p=459}}{{sfn|Ekwall|1928|p=xlii}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1918}} Shakespeare's most important source is probably the second edition of ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles|The Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande]]'' by [[Raphael Holinshed]], published in 1587. Holinshed himself found the story in the earlier ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], which was written in the 12th century. [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', published 1590, also contains a character named Cordelia, who also dies from hanging, as in ''King Lear''.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nOther possible sources are the anonymous play ''[[King Leir]]'' (published in 1605); ''[[The Mirror for Magistrates]]'' (1574), by John Higgins; ''[[The Malcontent]]'' (1604), by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]; ''[[The London Prodigal]]'' (1605); [[Montaigne]]'s ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'', which were translated into English by [[John Florio]] in 1603; ''[[An Historical Description of Iland of Britaine]]'' (1577), by [[William Harrison (clergyman)|William Harrison]]; ''[[Remaines Concerning Britaine]]'' (1606), by [[William Camden]]; ''[[Albion's England]]'' (1589), by [[William Warner (poet)|William Warner]]; and ''[[A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures]]'' (1603), by [[Samuel Harsnett]], which provided some of the language used by Edgar while he feigns madness.{{sfn|Hadfield|2007|p=208}} ''King Lear'' is also a literary variant of a common [[Fable|folk tale]], [[Water and Salt|Love Like Salt]], [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 923, in which a father rejects his youngest daughter for a statement of her love that does not please him.{{sfn|Mitakidou|Manna|2002|p=100}}{{sfn|Ashliman|2013}}\n\nThe source of the subplot involving Gloucester, Edgar, and Edmund is a tale in [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (1580\u201390), with a blind [[Paphlagonia]]n king and his two sons, Leonatus and Plexitrus.{{sfn|McNeir|1968}}\n\n===Changes from source material===\nBesides the subplot involving the Earl of Gloucester and his sons, the principal innovation Shakespeare made to this story was the death of Cordelia and Lear at the end; in the account by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Cordelia restores Lear to the throne, and succeeds him as ruler after his death. During the 17th century, Shakespeare's tragic ending was much criticised and alternative versions were written by [[Nahum Tate]], in which the leading characters survived and Edgar and Cordelia were married (despite the fact that Cordelia was previously betrothed to the King of France).{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=53}} As [[Harold Bloom]] states: \"Tate's version held the stage for almost 150 years, until [[Edmund Kean]] reinstated the play's tragic ending in 1823.\"{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=53}}\n\n==Date and text==\n[[File:Houghton STC 22292 - M. William Shak-speare, 1608.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the [[first quarto]] edition, published in 1608]]\nThere is no direct evidence to indicate when ''King Lear'' was written or first performed.  It is thought to have been composed sometime between 1603 and 1606. A [[Stationers' Register]] entry notes a performance before James I on 26 December 1606. The 1603 date originates from words in Edgar's speeches which may derive from [[Samuel Harsnett]]'s ''Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures'' (1603).{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1249}} A significant issue in the dating of the play is the relationship of ''King Lear'' to the play titled ''The True Chronicle History of the Life and Death of King Leir and his Three Daughters'', which was published for the first time after its entry in the Stationers' Register of 8 May 1605. This play had a significant effect on Shakespeare, and his close study of it suggests that he was using a printed copy, which suggests a composition date of 1605\u201306.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=89\u201390}} Conversely, Frank Kermode, in the ''Riverside Shakespeare'', considers the publication of ''Leir'' to have been a response to performances of Shakespeare's already-written play; noting a sonnet by [[William Strachey]] that may have verbal resemblances with ''Lear'', Kermode concludes that \"1604\u201305 seems the best compromise\".{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1250}}\n\nA line in the play that regards \"These late eclipses in the sun and moon\"<ref>''King Lear'', 1.2.103</ref> appears to refer to a phenomenon of two eclipses that occurred over London within a few days of each other\u2014the lunar eclipse of 27 September 1605 and the solar eclipse of 12 October 1605.  This remarkable pair of events stirred up much discussion among astrologers. Edmund's line \"A prediction I read this other day\u2026\"<ref>''King Lear'', 1.2.139</ref> apparently refers to the published prognostications of the astrologers, which followed after the eclipses.  This suggests that those lines in Act I were written sometime after both the eclipses and the published comments.{{sfn|Shaheen|1999|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Second Folio Title Page of King Lear.jpg|thumb|left|The first page of ''King Lear'', printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]The modern text of ''King Lear'' derives from three sources: two quartos, one published in 1608 (Q<sub>1</sub>) and the other in 1619 (Q<sub>2</sub>),{{efn|The 1619 quarto is part of William Jaggard's so-called [[False Folio]].}} and the version in the First Folio of 1623 (F<sub>1</sub>). The differences between these versions are significant. Q<sub>1</sub> contains 285 lines not in F<sub>1</sub>; F<sub>1</sub> contains around 100 lines not in Q<sub>1</sub>. Also, at least a thousand individual words are changed between the two texts, each text has different styles of punctuation, and about half the verse lines in the F<sub>1</sub> are either printed as prose or differently divided in the Q<sub>1</sub>. Early editors, beginning with [[Alexander Pope]], conflated the two texts, creating the modern version that has been commonly used since. The conflated version originated with the assumptions that the differences in the versions do not indicate any re-writing by the author; that Shakespeare wrote only one original manuscript, which is now lost; and that the Quarto and Folio versions contain various distortions of that lost original. Other editors, such as Nuttall and Bloom, have suggested Shakespeare himself maybe have been involved in reworking passages in the play to accommodate performances and other textual requirements of the play.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=xii}}\n\nAs early as 1931, [[Madeleine Doran]] suggested that the two texts had independent histories, and that these differences between them were critically interesting. This argument, however, was not widely discussed until the late 1970s, when it was revived, principally by Michael Warren and [[Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor]], who discuss a variety of theories including Doran's idea that the Quarto may have been printed from Shakespeare's [[foul papers]], and that the Folio may have been printed from a promptbook prepared for a production.{{sfn|Taylor|Warren|1983|p=429}}\n\nThe New Cambridge Shakespeare has published separate editions of Q and F; the most recent Pelican Shakespeare edition contains both the 1608 Quarto and the 1623 Folio text as well as a conflated version; the New Arden edition edited by [[R.A. Foakes]] offers a conflated text that indicates those passages that are found only in Q or F. Both Anthony Nuttall of Oxford University and Harold Bloom of Yale University have endorsed the view of Shakespeare having revised the tragedy at least once during his lifetime.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=xii}} As Bloom indicates: \"At the close of Shakespeare's revised ''King Lear'', a reluctant Edgar becomes King of Britain, accepting his destiny but in the accents of despair. Nuttall speculates that Edgar, like Shakespeare himself, usurps the power of manipulating the audience by deceiving poor Gloucester.\"{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=xii}}\n\n==Analysis and criticism==\nAnalysis and criticism of ''King Lear'' over the centuries has been extensive.\n{{Quote box\n |title =\n |quote = What we know of Shakespeare's wide reading and powers of assimilation seems to show that he made use of all kinds of material, absorbing contradictory viewpoints, positive and negative, religious and secular, as if to ensure that ''King Lear'' would offer no single controlling perspective, but be open to, indeed demand, multiple interpretations.\n |source = R.

Danby, in his ''Shakespeare's Doctrine of Nature \u2013 A Study of King Lear'' (1949), argues that ''Lear'' dramatizes, among other things, the current meanings of \"Nature.\" The words \"nature,\" \"natural,\" and \"unnatural\" occur over forty times in the play, reflecting a debate in Shakespeare's time about what nature really was like; this debate pervades the play and finds symbolic expression in Lear's changing attitude to Thunder. There are two strongly contrasting views of human nature in the play: that of the Lear party (Lear, Gloucester, Albany, Kent), exemplifying the philosophy of [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Richard Hooker|Hooker]], and that of the Edmund party (Edmund, Cornwall, Goneril, Regan), akin to the views later formulated by [[Hobbes]], though the latter had not yet begun his philosophy career when ''Lear'' was first performed. Along with the two views of Nature, the play contains two views of Reason, brought out in Gloucester and Edmund's speeches on astrology (1.2). The rationality of the Edmund party is one with which a modern audience more readily identifies. But the Edmund party carries bold rationalism to such extremes that it becomes madness: a madness-in-reason, the ironic counterpart of Lear's \"reason in madness\" (IV.6.190) and the Fool's wisdom-in-folly. This betrayal of reason lies behind the play's later emphasis on ''feeling''.\n\nThe two Natures and the two Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is the New Man, a member of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in contrast with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. ''King Lear'' is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new [[Niccol\u00f2_Machiavelli#Beliefs|Machiavellianism]]; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king's rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare's understanding of the New Man is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism\u2014the energy, the emancipation, the courage\u2014which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. \"He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. But he makes an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society.

In the 1604 elections to the House of Commons, [[John Fortescue of Salden|Sir John Fortescue]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was defeated by a member of the Buckinghamshire gentry, [[Francis Goodwin (MP)|Sir Francis Goodwin]].{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=103}} Displeased with the result, James declared the result of the [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghhamshire]] election invalid, and swore in Fortescue as the MP for Buckinghamshire while the House of Commons insisted on swearing in Goodwin, leading to a clash between King and Parliament over who had the right to decide who sat in the House of Commons.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=103}} The MP [[Thomas Wentworth (Recorder of Oxford)|Thomas Wentworth]], the son of another MP [[Peter Wentworth]]\u2014often imprisoned under Elizabeth for raising the question of the succession in the Commons\u2014was most forceful in protesting James's attempts to reduce the powers of the House of Commons, saying the King could not just declare the results of an election invalid if he disliked who had won the seat as he was insisting that he could.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} The character of Kent resembles Peter Wentworth in the way which is tactless and blunt in advising Lear, but his point is valid that Lear should be more careful with his friends and advisers.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}}\n\nJust as the House of Commons had argued to James that their loyalty was to the constitution of England, not to the King personally, Kent insists his loyalty is institutional, not personal, as he is loyal to the realm of which the king is head, not to Lear himself, and he tells Lear to behave better for the good of the realm.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} By contrast, Lear makes an argument similar to James that as king, he holds absolute power and could disregard the views of his subjects if they displease him whenever he liked.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} In the play, the characters like the Fool, Kent and Cordelia, whose loyalties are institutional, seeing their first loyalty to the realm, are portrayed more favorably than those like Regan and Goneril, who insist they are only loyal to the king, seeing their loyalties as personal.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} Likewise, James was notorious for his riotous, debauched lifestyle and his preference for sycophantic courtiers who were forever singing his praises out of the hope for advancement, aspects of his court that closely resemble the court of King Lear, who starts out in the play with a riotous, debauched court of sycophantic courtiers.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=105\u2013106}} Kent criticises Oswald as a man unworthy of office who has only been promoted because of his sycophancy, telling Lear that he should be loyal to those who are willing to tell him the truth, a statement that many in England wished that James would heed.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nFurthermore, James VI of Scotland inherited the throne of England upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, thereby uniting all of the kingdoms of the British isles into one, and a major issue of his reign was the attempt to forge a common British identity.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=98\u201399}} James had given his sons Henry and Charles the titles of Duke of Cornwell and Duke of Albany, the same titles bore by the men married to Regan and Goneril.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=99}} The play begins with Lear ruling all of Britain and ends with him destroying his realm; the critic Andrew Hadfield argued that the division of Britain by Lear was an inversion of the unification of Britain by James, who believed his policies would result in a well governed and prosperous unified realm being passed on to his heir.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=99}} Hadfield argued that the play was meant as a warning to James as in the play a monarch loses everything by giving in to his sycophantic courtiers who only seek to use him while neglecting those who truly loved him.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=99}} Hadfield also argued that the world of Lear's court is \"childish\" with Lear presenting himself as the father of the nation and requiring all of his subjects, not just his children, to address him in paternal terms, which infantises most of the people around him, which pointedly references James's statement in his 1598 book ''The Trew Law of Free Monarchies'' that the king is the \"father of the nation,\" for whom all of his subjects are his children.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\n===Psychoanalytic and psychosocial interpretations===\n''King Lear'' provides a basis for \"the primary enactment of psychic breakdown in English literary history\".{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=19}} The play begins with Lear's \"near-fairytale narcissism\".{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=20}}\n\nGiven the absence of legitimate mothers in ''King Lear'', [[Copp\u00e9lia Kahn]]{{sfn|Kahn|1986}} provides a psychoanalytic interpretation of the \"maternal subtext\" found in the play. According to Kahn, Lear's old age forces him to regress into an infantile disposition, and he now seeks a love that is traditionally satisfied by a mothering woman, but in the absence of a real mother, his daughters become the mother figures. Lear's contest of love between Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia serves as the binding agreement; his daughters will get their inheritance provided that they care for him, especially Cordelia, on whose \"kind nursery\" he will greatly depend.\n\nCordelia's refusal to dedicate herself to him and love him as more than a father has been interpreted by some as a resistance to incest, but Kahn also inserts the image of a rejecting mother. The situation is now a reversal of parent-child roles, in which Lear's madness is a childlike rage due to his deprivation of filial/maternal care. Even when Lear and Cordelia are captured together, his madness persists as Lear envisions a nursery in prison, where Cordelia's sole existence is for him. It is only with Cordelia's death that his fantasy of a daughter-mother ultimately diminishes, as ''King Lear'' concludes with only male characters living.\n\n[[File:Lear and Cordelia in Prison c1779 N 05189 B 53 Pen and watercolour 123\u00d7175 by William Blake.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|''Lear and Cordelia in Prison'' \u2013 [[William Blake]] circa&nbsp;1779]]\n[[Sigmund Freud]] asserted that Cordelia symbolises Death. Therefore, when the play begins with Lear rejecting his daughter, it can be interpreted as him rejecting death; Lear is unwilling to face the finitude of his being. The play's poignant ending scene, wherein Lear carries the body of his beloved Cordelia, was of great importance to Freud. In this scene, Cordelia forces the realization of his finitude, or as Freud put it, she causes him to \"make friends with the necessity of dying\".{{sfn|Freud|1997|p=120}} Shakespeare had particular intentions with Cordelia's death, and was the only writer to have Cordelia killed (in the version by the Nahum Tate, she continues to live happily, and in Holinshed's, she restores her father and succeeds him).\n\nAlternatively, an analysis based on [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] theory suggests that the King's contest among his daughters in Act I has more to do with his control over the unmarried Cordelia.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1978|p=39}} This theory indicates that the King's \"dethronement\"{{sfn|Croake|1983|p=247}} might have led him to seek control that he lost after he divided his land.\n\nIn his study of the character-portrayal of Edmund, Harold Bloom refers to him as \"Shakespeare's most original character\".{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=317}}\n\n\"As Hazlitt pointed out\", writes Bloom, \"Edmund does not share in the hypocrisy of Goneril and Regan: his Machiavellianism is absolutely pure, and lacks an Oedipal motive. Freud's vision of family romances simply does not apply to Edmund. Iago is free to reinvent himself every minute, yet Iago has strong passions, however negative. Edmund has no passions whatsoever; he has never loved anyone, and he never will. In that respect, he is Shakespeare's most original character.\"{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe tragedy of Lear's lack of understanding of the consequences of his demands and actions is often observed to be like that of a spoiled child, but it has also been noted that his behaviour is equally likely to be seen in parents who have never adjusted to their children having grown up.{{sfn|Kamaralli|2015}}\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:King Lear and Cordelia (West, 1793).jpg|thumb|A 1793 painting of King Lear and Cordelia by [[Benjamin West]].]]\nCritics are divided on the question of whether or not ''King Lear'' represents an affirmation of a particular Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Peat|1982|p=43}} Those who maintain this position posit different arguments, which include the significance of Lear's self-divestment.{{sfn|Kronenfeld|1998|p=181}} For some critics, this reflects the Christian concepts of the fall of the mighty and the inevitable loss of worldly possessions. By 1569, sermons delivered at court such as those at Windsor declared how \"rich men are rich dust, wise men wise dust... From him that weareth purple, and beareth the crown down to him that is clad with meanest apparel, there is nothing but garboil, and ruffle, and hoisting, and lingering wrath, and fear of death and death itself, and hunger, and many a whip of God.\"{{sfn|Kronenfeld|1998|p=181}} Some see this in Cordelia and what she symbolized\u2014that the material body are mere husks that would eventually be discarded so that the fruit can be reached.{{sfn|Peat|1982|p=43}}\n\nAmong those who argue that Lear is redeemed in the Christian sense through suffering are [[A.C. Bradley]]{{sfn|Bradley|1905|p=285}} and John Reibetanz, who has written: \"through his sufferings, Lear has won an enlightened soul\".{{sfn|Reibetanz|1977|p=108}} Other critics who find no evidence of redemption and emphasise the horrors of the final act include [[John Holloway (poet)|John Holloway]]{{sfn|Holloway|1961|p=}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} and Marvin Rosenberg.{{sfn|Rosenberg|1992|p=}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} William R. Elton stresses the pre-Christian setting of the play, writing that, \"Lear fulfills the criteria for pagan behavior in life,\" falling \"into total blasphemy at the moment of his irredeemable loss\".{{sfn|Elton|1988|p=260}} This is related to the way some sources cite that at the end of the narrative, King Lear raged against heaven before eventually dying in despair with the death of Cordelia.{{sfn|Pierce|2008|p=xx}}\n\n==Performance history==\n''King Lear'' has been performed by esteemed actors since the 17th&nbsp;century, when men played all the roles. From the 20th&nbsp;century, a number of women have played male roles in the play; most commonly the Fool, who has been played (among others) by [[Judy Davis]], [[Emma Thompson]] and [[Robyn Nevin]]. Lear himself has been played by [[Marianne Hoppe]] in 1990,{{sfn|Croall|2015|p=70}} by [[Janet Wright]] in 1995,{{sfn|Nestruck|2016}} by [[Kathryn Hunter]] in 1996\u201397,{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=171}} and by [[Glenda Jackson]] in 2016 and 2019.{{sfn|Cavendish|2016}}\n\n=== 17th century ===\n[[File:LearTate.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of [[Nahum Tate|Tate]]'s ''The History of King Lear'']]\nShakespeare wrote the role of Lear for his company's chief tragedian, [[Richard Burbage]], for whom Shakespeare was writing incrementally older characters as their careers progressed.{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=5}} It has been speculated either that the role of the Fool was written for the company's clown [[Robert Armin]], or that it was written for performance by one of the company's [[Boy player|boys]], doubling the role of Cordelia.{{sfn|Thomson|2002|p=143}}{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=6}} Only one specific performance of the play during Shakespeare's lifetime is known: before the court of [[James I of England|King James I]] at Whitehall on 26 December 1606.{{sfn|Hunter|1972|p=45}}{{sfn|Taylor|2002|pp=18\u201319}} Its original performances would have been at [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]], where there were no sets in the modern sense, and characters would have signified their roles visually with props and costumes: Lear's costume, for example, would have changed in the course of the play as his status diminished: commencing in crown and regalia; then as a huntsman; raging bareheaded in the storm scene; and finally crowned with flowers in parody of his original status.{{sfn|Gurr|Ichikawa|2000|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAll theatres were closed down by the [[Puritan]] government on 6 September 1642. Upon the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]]) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=21}} And from the restoration until the mid-19th century the performance history of ''King Lear'' is not the story of Shakespeare's version, but instead of ''[[The History of King Lear]]'', a popular adaptation by [[Nahum Tate]]. Its most significant deviations from Shakespeare were to omit the Fool entirely, to introduce a happy ending in which Lear and Cordelia survive, and to develop a love story between Cordelia and Edgar (two characters who never interact in Shakespeare) which ends with their marriage.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=324\u2013325}} Like most Restoration adapters of Shakespeare, Tate admired Shakespeare's natural genius but saw fit to augment his work with contemporary standards of art (which were largely guided by the neoclassical [[unities]] of time, place, and action).{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=43}} Tate's struggle to strike a balance between raw nature and refined art is apparent in his description of the tragedy: \"a heap of jewels, unstrung and unpolish't; yet so dazzling in their disorder, that I soon perceiv'd I had seiz'd a treasure.\"{{sfn|Armstrong|2003|p=312}}{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=190}} Other changes included giving Cordelia a ''confidante'' named Arante, bringing the play closer to contemporary notions of [[poetic justice]], and adding titilating material such as amorous encounters between Edmund and both Regan and Goneril, a scene in which Edgar rescues Cordelia from Edmund's attempted kidnap and rape,{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=186}}{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=28}} and a scene in which Cordelia wears men's pants that would reveal the actress's ankles.{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=47}} The play ends with a celebration of \"the King's blest Restauration\",<!-- sic --> an obvious reference to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].{{efn|Jean I.

For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' on 16 April 1711 [[Joseph Addison]] wrote \"''King Lear'' is an admirable Tragedy ... as ''Shakespeare'' wrote it; but as it is reformed according to the chymerical Notion of poetical Justice in my humble Opinion it hath lost half its Beauty.\"<!-- sic, as regards italics and capitalisation throughout, and the spelling of \"chymerical\" --> Yet on the stage, Tate's version prevailed.{{efn|Quoted by Jean I. Marsden.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=30}}}}\n\n[[David Garrick]] was the first actor-manager to begin to cut back on elements of Tate's adaptation in favour of Shakespeare's original: he retained Tate's major changes, including the happy ending, but removed many of Tate's lines, including Edgar's closing speech.{{sfn|Tatspaugh|2003|p=528}} He also reduced the prominence of the Edgar-Cordelia love story, in order to focus more on the relationship between Lear and his daughters.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=33}} His version had a powerful emotional impact: Lear driven to madness by his daughters was (in the words of one spectator, Arthur Murphy) \"the finest tragic distress ever seen on any stage\" and, in contrast, the devotion shown to Lear by Cordelia (a mix of Shakespeare's, Tate's and Garrick's contributions to the part) moved the audience to tears.{{efn|Jean I. Marsden cites ''Gray's Inn Journal'' 12 January 1754.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=33}}}}\n\nThe first professional performances of ''King Lear'' in North America are likely to have been those of the [[American Company|Hallam Company]] (later the American Company) which arrived in Virginia in 1752 and who counted the play among their repertoire by the time of their departure for Jamaica in 1774.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=232}}\n\n=== 19th century ===\n[[File:James Barry 002.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|''King Lear mourns Cordelia's death'', [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], 1786\u20131788]]\n\n[[Charles Lamb]] established the [[Romanticism|Romantics]]' attitude to ''King Lear'' in his 1811 essay \"On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, considered with reference to their fitness for stage representation\" where he says that the play \"is essentially impossible to be represented on the stage\", preferring to experience it in the study. In the theatre, he argues, \"to see Lear acted, to see an old man tottering about the stage with a walking-stick, turned out of doors by his daughters on a rainy night, has nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting\" yet \"while we read it, we see not Lear but we are Lear,\u2014we are in his mind, we are sustained by a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters and storms.\"{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=40}}{{sfn|Hunter|1972|p=50}}\n\n''King Lear'' was politically controversial during the period of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s madness, and as a result was not performed at all in the two professional theatres of London from 1811 to 1820: but was then the subject of major productions in both, within three months of his death.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=189}} The 19th century saw the gradual reintroduction of Shakespeare's text to displace Tate's version. Like [[David Garrick|Garrick]] before him, [[John Philip Kemble]] had introduced more of Shakespeare's text, while still preserving the three main elements of Tate's version: the love story, the omission of the Fool, and the happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances.{{sfn|Potter|2001|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=62}} At last in 1838, [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden performed Shakespeare's version, freed from Tate's adaptions.{{sfn|Potter|2001|pp=190\u2013191}} The restored character of the Fool was played by an actress, [[Priscilla Horton]], as, in the words of one spectator, \"a fragile, hectic, beautiful-faced, half-idiot-looking boy.\"{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=191}} And [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=161}} [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], writing in the ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|Examiner]]'' on 14 February 1838, expressed the hope that \"Mr Macready's success has banished that disgrace [Tate's version] from the stage for ever.\"{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=73}} But even this version was not close to Shakespeare's: the 19th-century actor-managers heavily cut Shakespeare's scripts: ending scenes on big \"curtain effects\" and reducing or eliminating supporting roles to give greater prominence to the star.{{sfn|Hunter|1972|p=51}} One of Macready's innovations\u2014the use of [[Stonehenge]]-like structures on stage to indicate an ancient setting\u2014proved enduring on stage into the 20th century, and can be seen in the 1983 television version starring [[Laurence Olivier]].{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nIn 1843, the [[Theatres Act 1843|Act for Regulating the Theatres]] came into force, bringing an end to the monopolies of the two existing companies and, by doing so, increased the number of theatres in London.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=191}} At the same time, the fashion in theatre was \"pictorial\": valuing visual spectacle above plot or characterisation and often required lengthy (and time-consuming) scene changes.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=58\u201375}} For example, [[Henry Irving]]'s 1892 ''King Lear'' offered spectacles such as Lear's death beneath a cliff at Dover, his face lit by the red glow of a setting sun; at the expense of cutting 46% of the text, including the blinding of Gloucester.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=193}} But Irving's production clearly evoked strong emotions: one spectator, Gordon Crosse, wrote of the first entrance of Lear, \"a striking figure with masses of white hair. He is leaning on a huge scabbarded sword which he raises with a wild cry in answer to the shouted greeting of his guards. His gait, his looks, his gestures, all reveal the noble, imperious mind already degenerating into senile irritability under the coming shocks of grief and age.\"{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=206}}\n\nThe importance of pictorialism to Irving, and to other theatre professionals of the Victorian era, is exemplified by the fact that Irving had used [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''Cordelia's Portion'' as the inspiration for the look of his production, and that the artist himself was brought in to provide sketches for the settings of other scenes.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|p=63}} A reaction against pictorialism came with the rise of the reconstructive movement, believers in a simple style of staging more similar to that which would have pertained in renaissance theatres, whose chief early exponent was the actor-manager [[William Poel]]. Poel was influenced by a performance of ''King Lear'' directed by Jocza Savits at the Hoftheater in Munich in 1890, set on an [[apron stage]] with a three-tier [[Globe Theatre|Globe]]\u2014like reconstruction theatre as its backdrop. Poel would use this same configuration for his own Shakespearean performances in 1893.{{sfn|O'Connor|2002|p=78}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Cordelia's Portion.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Cordelia's Portion'' by [[Ford Madox Brown]]]]\n\nBy mid-century, the actor-manager tradition had declined, to be replaced by a structure where the major theatre companies employed professional directors as auteurs. The last of the great actor-managers, [[Donald Wolfit]], played Lear in 1944 on a Stonehenge-like set and was praised by [[James Agate]] as \"the greatest piece of Shakespearean acting since I have been privileged to write for the ''Sunday Times''\".{{efn|Quoted by Stanley Wells.{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=224}}}}{{sfn|Foakes|1997|p=89}} Wolfit supposedly drank eight bottles of Guinness in the course of each performance.{{efn|According to [[Ronald Harwood]], quoted by Stanley Wells.{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=229}}}}\n\nThe character of Lear in the 19th century was often that of a frail old man from the opening scene, but Lears of the 20th century often began the play as strong men displaying regal authority, including [[John Gielgud]], [[Donald Wolfit]] and [[Donald Sinden]].{{sfn|Foakes|1997|p=24}} Cordelia, also, evolved in the 20th century: earlier Cordelias had often been praised for being sweet, innocent and modest, but 20th-century Cordelias were often portrayed as war leaders. For example, [[Peggy Ashcroft]], at the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|RST]] in 1950, played the role in a breastplate and carrying a sword.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=36\u201337}} Similarly, the Fool evolved through the course of the century, with portrayals often deriving from the [[music hall]] or [[circus]] tradition.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|p=52}}\n\nAt Stratford-upon-Avon in 1962 [[Peter Brook]] (who would later film the play with the same actor, [[Paul Scofield]], in the role of Lear) set the action simply, against a huge, empty white stage. The effect of the scene when Lear and Gloucester meet, two tiny figures in rags in the midst of this emptiness, was said (by the scholar Roger Warren) to catch \"both the human pathos ... and the universal scale ... of the scene.\"{{sfn|Warren|1986|p=266}} Some of the lines from the radio broadcast were used by [[The Beatles]] to add into the recorded mix of the song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". [[John Lennon]] happened upon the play on the [[BBC Third Programme]] while fiddling with the radio while working on the song. The voices of actors [[Mark Dignam]], [[Philip Guard]], and John Bryning from the play are all heard in the song.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=134\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=128}}\n\nLike other Shakespearean tragedies, ''King Lear'' has proved amenable to conversion into other theatrical traditions. In 1989, David McRuvie and Iyyamkode Sreedharan adapted the play then translated it to [[Malayalam]], for performance in [[Kerala]] in the [[Kathakali]] tradition\u2014which itself developed around 1600, contemporary with Shakespeare's writing. The show later went on tour, and in 2000 played at [[Shakespeare's Globe]], completing, according to Anthony Dawson, \"a kind of symbolic circle\".{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=178}} Perhaps even more radical was [[Ong Keng Sen]]'s 1997 adaptation of ''King Lear'', which featured six actors each performing in a separate Asian acting tradition and in their own separate languages. A pivotal moment occurred when the [[Peking opera|Jingju]] performer playing Older Daughter (a conflation of Goneril and Regan) stabbed the [[Noh]]-performed Lear whose \"falling pine\" deadfall, straight face-forward into the stage, astonished the audience, in what Yong Li Lan describes as a \"triumph through the moving power of ''noh'' performance at the very moment of his character's defeat\".{{sfn|Lan|2005|p=532}}{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|p=265}}\n\nIn 1974, [[Buzz Goodbody]] directed ''Lear'', a deliberately abbreviated title for Shakespeare's text, as the inaugural production of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]]'s studio theatre [[The Other Place (theatre)|The Other Place]]. The performance was conceived as a chamber piece, the small intimate space and proximity to the audience enabled detailed psychological acting, which was performed with simple sets and in modern dress.{{sfn|Holland|2001|p=211}} Peter Holland has speculated that this company/directoral decision\u2014namely ''choosing'' to present Shakespeare in a small venue for artistic reasons when a larger venue was available\u2014may at the time have been unprecedented.{{sfn|Holland|2001|p=211}}\n\nBrook's earlier vision of the play proved influential, and directors have gone further in presenting Lear as (in the words of [[R.A. Foakes]]) \"a pathetic senior citizen trapped in a violent and hostile environment\". When [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] took the role in 1990, he played the later scenes in clothes that looked like cast-offs, inviting deliberate parallels with the uncared-for in modern Western societies.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=27\u201328}} Indeed, modern productions of Shakespeare's plays often reflect the world in which they are performed as much as the world for which they were written: and the Moscow theatre scene in 1994 provided an example, when two very different productions of the play (those by Sergei Zhonovach and Alexei Borodin), very different from one another in their style and outlook, were both reflections on the break-up of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Holland|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2002 and 2010, the [[Hudson Shakespeare Company]] of New Jersey staged separate productions as part of their respective [[Shakespeare in the Park festivals|Shakespeare in the Parks]] seasons. The 2002 version was directed by Michael Collins and transposed the action to a West Indies, nautical setting. Actors were featured in outfits indicative of looks of various Caribbean islands. The 2010 production directed by Jon Ciccarelli was fashioned after the atmosphere of the film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' with a palette of reds and blacks and set the action in an urban setting. Lear (Tom Cox) appeared as a head of multi-national conglomerate who divided up his fortune among his socialite daughter Goneril (Brenda Scott), his officious middle daughter Regan (Noelle Fair) and university daughter Cordelia (Emily Best).{{sfn|Beckerman|2010}}\n\nIn 2012, renowned Canadian director Peter Hinton directed an all-[[First Nations]] production of ''King Lear'' at the [[National Arts Centre]] in Ottawa, Ontario, with the setting changed to an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] nation in the 17th century.{{sfn|Nestruck|2012}} The cast included [[August Schellenberg]] as Lear, [[Billy Merasty]] as Gloucester, [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as Regan, [[Kevin Loring]] as Edmund, [[Jani Lauzon]] in a dual role as Cordelia and the Fool, and [[Craig Lauzon]] as Kent.{{sfn|Nestruck|2012}} This setting would later be reproduced as part of the ''Manga Shakespeare'' graphic novel series published by Self-Made Hero, adapted by Richard Appignanesi and featuring the illustrations of Ilya.\n\nIn 2015 Toronto's [[Theatre Passe Muraille]] staged a production set in Upper Canada against the backdrop of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837. This production starred [[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]] as Lear.{{sfn|Ouzounian|2015}}\n\nIn the summer of 2015\u20132016, The [[Sydney Theatre Company]] staged ''King Lear'', directed by [[Neil Armfield]] with [[Geoffrey Rush]] in the lead role and [[Robyn Nevin]] as the Fool. About the madness at the heart of the play, Rush said that for him \"it's about finding the dramatic impact in the moments of his mania. What seems to work best is finding a vulnerability or a point of empathy, where an audience can look at Lear and think how shocking it must be to be that old and to be banished from your family into the open air in a storm. That's a level of impoverishment you would never want to see in any other human being, ever.\"{{sfn|Blake|2015}}\n\nIn 2016 [[Talawa Theatre Company]] and [[Royal Exchange Manchester]] co-produced a production of ''King Lear'' with [[Don Warrington]] in the title role.{{sfn|Hutchison|2015}} The production, featuring a largely black cast, was described in ''The Guardian'' as being \"as close to definitive as can be\".{{sfn|Hickling|2016}} ''The Daily Telegraph'' wrote that \"Don Warrington's King Lear is a heartbreaking tour de force\".{{sfn|Allfree|2016}} ''King Lear'' was staged by [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], with Antony Sher in the lead role. The performance was directed by Gregory Doran and was described as having \"strength and depth\".{{sfn|Billington|2016}}\n\nIn 2017, the [[Guthrie Theatre]] produced a production of ''King Lear'' with [[Stephen Yoakam]] in the title role. [[Armin Shimerman]] appeared as the fool, portraying it with \"an unusual grimness, but it works\",{{sfn|Ringham|2017}} in a production that was hailed as \"a devastating piece of theater, and a production that does it justice.\"{{sfn|Ringham|2017}}\n\nLear has been recently played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by [[Christopher Plummer]] in 2004 and [[Glenda Jackson]] in 2019, with Jackson reprising her portrayal from a 2016 production at [[The Old Vic]] in London.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film and video===\nThe first film of ''King Lear'' was a five-minute German version made around 1905, which has not survived.{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=205}} The oldest extant version is a ten-minute studio-based version from 1909 by Vitagraph, which, according to Luke McKernan, made the \"ill-advised\" decision to attempt to cram in as much of the plot as possible.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=83}} Two silent versions, both titled ''Re Lear'', were made in Italy in 1910. Of these, the version by director Gerolamo Lo Savio was filmed on location, and it dropped the Edgar sub-plot and used frequent intertitling to make the plot easier to follow than its Vitagraph predecessor.{{efn|This version appears on the British Film Institute video compilation ''Silent Shakespeare'' (1999).{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=84}}}} A contemporary setting was used for [[Louis Feuillade]]'s 1911 French adaptation ''Le Roi Lear Au Village'', and in 1914 in America, Ernest Warde expanded the story to an hour, including spectacles such as a final battle scene.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\nThe [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz|Joseph Mankiewicz]] (1949) ''[[House of Strangers]]'' is often considered a ''Lear'' adaptation, but the parallels are more striking in ''[[Broken Lance]]'' (1954) in which a cattle baron played by [[Spencer Tracy]] tyrannizes his three sons, and only the youngest, Joe, played by [[Robert Wagner]], remains loyal.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nThe TV anthology series ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' (1952\u20131961) staged a 73-minute version of ''[[King Lear (1953 film)|King Lear]]'' on October 18, 1953. It was adapted by [[Peter Brook]] and starred [[Orson Welles]] in his American television debut.{{sfn|Crosby|1953}}\n\nTwo screen versions of ''King Lear'' date from the early 1970s: [[Grigori Kozintsev]]'s ''[[King Lear (1971 USSR film)|Korol Lir]]'',{{efn|The original title of this film in [[Cyrillic script]] is ''{{lang|ru|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u041b\u0438\u0440}}'' and the sources anglicise it with different spellings. Daniel Rosenthal gives it as ''{{transl|ru|Korol Lir}}'',{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=79}} while Douglas Brode gives it as ''{{transl|ru|Karol Lear}}''.{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=210}}}} and [[Peter Brook|Peter Brook's]] film of ''[[King Lear (1971 UK film)|King Lear]]'', which stars [[Paul Scofield]].{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=206}} Brook's film starkly divided the critics: [[Pauline Kael]] said \"I didn't just dislike this production, I hated it!\" and suggested the alternative title ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.{{efn|[[Pauline Kael]]'s ''New Yorker'' review is quoted by Douglas Brode.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=206, 209}}}} Yet Robert Hatch in ''The Nation'' thought it as \"excellent a filming of the play as one can expect\" and Vincent Canby in ''The New York Times'' called it \"an exalting ''Lear'', full of exquisite terror\".{{efn|Both quoted by Douglas Brode.{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=206}}}} The film drew on the ideas of [[Jan Kott]], in particular his observation that ''King Lear'' was the precursor of [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist theatre]], and that it has parallels with [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=206\u2013207}} Critics who dislike the film particularly draw attention to its bleak nature from its opening: complaining that the world of the play does not deteriorate with Lear's suffering, but commences dark, colourless and wintry, leaving, according to Douglas Brode, \"Lear, the land, and us with nowhere to go\".{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=206\u2013210}} Cruelty pervades the film, which does not distinguish between the violence of ostensibly good and evil characters, presenting both savagely.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=82}} Paul Scofield, as Lear, eschews sentimentality: This demanding old man with a coterie of unruly knights provokes audience sympathy for the daughters in the early scenes, and his presentation explicitly rejects the tradition of playing Lear as \"poor old white-haired patriarch\".{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=83}}\n\n''[[King Lear (1971 USSR film)|Korol Lir]]'' has been praised by critic Alexander Anikst for the \"serious, deeply thoughtful\" even \"philosophical approach\" of director [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and writer [[Boris Pasternak]]. Making a thinly veiled criticism of Brook in the process, Anikst praised the fact that there were \"no attempts at sensationalism, no efforts to 'modernise' Shakespeare by introducing Freudian themes, Existentialist ideas, eroticism, or sexual perversion. [Kozintsev] ... has simply made a film of Shakespeare's tragedy.\"{{efn|Quoted by Douglas Brode.{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=211}}}} [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] provided an epic score, its motifs including an (increasingly ironic) trumpet fanfare for Lear, and a five-bar \"Call to Death\" marking each character's demise.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=81}} Kozintzev described his vision of the film as an ensemble piece: with Lear, played by a dynamic [[J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet]], as first among equals in a cast of fully developed characters.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=211\u2013212}} The film highlights Lear's role as king by including his people throughout the film on a scale no stage production could emulate, charting the central character's decline from their god to their helpless equal; his final descent into madness marked by his realisation that he has neglected the \"poor naked wretches\".{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=79\u201380}}{{sfd|King Lear|3|4|32}} As the film progresses, ruthless characters\u2014Goneril, Regan, Edmund\u2014increasingly appear isolated in shots, in contrast to the director's focus, throughout the film, on masses of human beings.{{sfn|Guntner|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n[[Jonathan Miller]] twice directed [[Michael Hordern]] in the title role for English television, the first for the BBC's ''[[Play of the Month]]'' in 1975 and the second for the ''[[BBC Television Shakespeare]]'' in 1982. Hordern received mixed reviews, and was considered a bold choice due to his history of taking much lighter roles.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|pp=85\u201387}} Also for English television, [[Laurence Olivier]] took the role in a [[King Lear (1983 TV programme)|1983 TV production]] for Granada Television. It was his last screen appearance in a Shakespearean role.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nIn 1985 a major screen adaptation of the play appeared: ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'', directed by [[Akira Kurosawa]]. At the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made, it tells the story of Hidetora, a fictional 16th-century Japanese warlord, whose attempt to divide his kingdom among his three sons leads to an estrangement with the youngest, and ultimately most loyal, of them, and eventually to civil war.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=84}} In contrast to the cold drab greys of Brook and Kozintsev, Kurosawa's film is full of vibrant colour: external scenes in yellows, blues and greens, interiors in browns and ambers, and [[Emi Wada]]'s [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Oscar]]-winning colour-coded costumes for each family member's soldiers.{{sfn|Guntner|2007|p=136}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=84}} Hidetora has a back-story: a violent and ruthless rise to power, and the film portrays contrasting victims: the virtuous characters Sue and Tsurumaru who are able to forgive, and the vengeful Kaede ([[Mieko Harada]]), Hidetora's daughter-in-law and the film's [[Lady Macbeth]]-like villain.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=84\u201387}}{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=225}}\n\n[[File:House-of-strangers-trailer.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|Screenshot from trailer for ''[[House of Strangers]]'' (1949)<br>\"The film has two antecedents\u2014biblical references to Joseph and his brothers and ''King Lear''\".{{sfn|Griggs|2009|p=122}}]]\nA scene in which a character is threatened with blinding in the manner of Gloucester forms the climax of the 1973 parody horror ''[[Theatre of Blood]]''.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=85}} Comic use is made of Sir's inability to physically carry any actress cast as Cordelia opposite his Lear in the [[The Dresser (1983 film)|1983 film]] of the stage play ''[[The Dresser]]''.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=87}} [[John Boorman]]'s 1990 ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' features a father who disinherits his three spoiled children.{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=308}} [[Francis Ford Coppola]] deliberately incorporated elements of ''Lear'' in his 1990 sequel ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', including Michael Corleone's attempt to retire from crime throwing his domain into anarchy, and most obviously the death of his daughter in his arms. Parallels have also been drawn between [[Andy Garc\u00eda]]'s character Vincent and both Edgar and Edmund, and between [[Talia Shire]]'s character Connie and Kaede in ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''.{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=299}}\n\nIn 1997 [[Jocelyn Moorhouse]] directed ''[[A Thousand Acres (film)|A Thousand Acres]]'', based on [[Jane Smiley]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, set in 1990s Iowa.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=88}} The film is described, by scholar Tony Howard, as the first adaptation to confront the play's disturbing sexual dimensions.{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=299}} The story is told from the viewpoint of the elder two daughters, Ginny played by [[Jessica Lange]] and Rose played by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who were sexually abused by their father as teenagers. Their younger sister Caroline, played by [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] had escaped this fate and is ultimately the only one to remain loyal.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=217}}\n\nThe play was adapted to the world of gangsters in [[Don Boyd]]'s 2001 ''[[My Kingdom (film)|My Kingdom]]'', a version which differs from all others in commencing with the Lear character, Sandeman, played by [[Richard Harris]], in a loving relationship with his wife. But her violent death marks the start of an increasingly bleak and violent chain of events (influenced by co-writer Nick Davies' documentary book ''Dark Heart'') which in spite of the director's denial that the film had \"serious parallels\" to Shakespeare's play, actually mirror aspects of its plot closely.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=90\u201391}}{{sfn|Lehmann|2006|pp=72\u201389}} Unlike Shakespeare's Lear, but like Hidetora and Sandeman, the central character of [[Uli Edel]]'s 2002 American TV adaptation ''[[King of Texas]]'', John Lear played by [[Patrick Stewart]], has a back-story centred on his violent rise to power as the richest landowner (metaphorically a \"king\") in General [[Sam Houston]]'s independent Texas in the early 1840s. Daniel Rosenthal comments that the film was able, by reason of having been commissioned by the cable channel TNT, to include a bleaker and more violent ending than would have been possible on the national networks.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=92\u201393}} 2003's [[Channel 4]]-commissioned two-parter ''Second Generation'' set the story in the world of Asian manufacturing and music in England.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|Shaughnessy|2006|p=99}}\n\nThe 2006 Chinese film ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' is based loosely on ''King Lear'', but the plot is set in [[Tang Dynasty]] China instead of Medieval Europe.\n\nIn 2008, a version of ''[[King Lear (2008 film)|King Lear]]'' produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company premiered with [[Ian McKellen]] in the role of King Lear.\n\nIn the 2012 romantic comedy ''If I Were You'', there is a reference to the play when the lead characters are cast in a female version of King Lear set in modern times, with Marcia Gay Harden cast in the Lear role and [[Lenore Watling]] as \"the fool.\" Lear is an executive in a corporate empire instead of a literal one, being phased out of her position. The off-beat play (and its cast) is a major plot element of the movie.\n\n[[Carl Bessai]] wrote and directed a modern adaptation of ''King Lear'' titled ''[[The Lears]]''. Released in 2017, the film starred [[Bruce Dern]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Sean Astin]].{{sfn|McNary|2016}}\n\nOn 28 May 2018, BBC Two broadcast ''[[King Lear (2018 film)|King Lear]]'' starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the title role and [[Emma Thompson]] as Goneril.

It tells the tale of a king who bequeaths his power and land to two of his three daughters, after they declare their love for him in an extremely fawning and obsequious manner. His third daughter gets nothing, because she will not flatter him as her sisters had done.  When he feels he has been treated with disrespect by the two daughters who now have his wealth and power, he becomes furious to the point of madness. He eventually becomes tenderly reconciled to his third daughter, just before tragedy strikes her and then the king.\n\nDerived from the legend of [[Leir of Britain]], a mythological [[British Iron Age|pre-Roman]] Celtic king, the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures, with the title role coveted by many of the world's most accomplished actors.\n\nThe first attribution to Shakespeare of this play, originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on [[St. Stephen's Day]] in 1606, was a 1608 publication in a [[quarto]] of uncertain [[provenance]], in which the play is listed as a [[Shakespearean history|history]]; it may be an early draft or simply reflect the first performance text. ''The Tragedy of King Lear'', a revised version that is better tailored for performance, was included in the 1623 [[First Folio]]. Modern editors usually [[conflate]] the two, though some insist that each version has its own individual integrity that should be preserved.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration]], the play was often revised with a happy ending for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone, but since the 19th century Shakespeare's original version has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements. The tragedy is noted for its probing observations on the nature of human suffering and kinship. [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote \"No man will ever write a better tragedy than ''Lear''.\"{{sfn|Shaw|1961|p=111}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes}}\n* [[Leir of Britain|Lear]]{{snd}}King of Britain\n* Earl of Gloucester\n* Earl of Kent{{snd}}later disguised as Caius\n* [[Shakespearean fool|Fool]]{{snd}}Lear's fool\n* Edgar{{snd}}Gloucester's first-born son\n* [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]]{{snd}}Gloucester's illegitimate son\n* [[Goneril]]{{snd}}Lear's eldest daughter\n* [[Regan (King Lear)|Regan]]{{snd}}Lear's second daughter\n* [[Cordelia (King Lear)|Cordelia]]{{snd}}Lear's youngest daughter\n* Duke of Albany{{snd}}Goneril's husband\n* Duke of Cornwall{{snd}}Regan's husband\n* Gentleman{{snd}}attends Cordelia\n* Oswald{{snd}}Goneril's loyal steward\n* King of France{{snd}}suitor and later husband to Cordelia\n* Duke of Burgundy{{snd}}suitor to Cordelia\n* Old man{{snd}}tenant of Gloucester\n* Curan{{snd}}courtier\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Act I===\n[[File:Cordelia-in-the-Court-of-King-Lear-1873-Sir-John-Gilbert.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Cordelia in the Court of King Lear'' (1873) by [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]]]]\nKing Lear of Britain, elderly and wanting to retire from the duties of the monarchy, decides to divide his realm among his three daughters, and declares he will offer the largest share to the one who loves him most. The eldest, [[Goneril]], speaks first, declaring her love for her father in fulsome terms. Moved by her flattery Lear proceeds to grant to Goneril her share as soon as she has finished her declaration, before [[Regan]] and [[Cordelia]] have a chance to speak. He then awards to Regan her share as soon as she has spoken. When it is finally the turn of his youngest and favourite daughter, Cordelia, at first she refuses to say anything (\"Nothing, my Lord\") and then declares there is nothing to compare her love to, no words to properly express it; she says honestly but bluntly that she loves him according to her bond, no more and no less. Infuriated, Lear disinherits Cordelia and divides her share between her elder sisters.\n\nThe Earl of Gloucester and the Earl of Kent observe that, by dividing his realm between Goneril and Regan, Lear has awarded his realm in equal shares to the peerages of the Duke of Albany (Goneril's husband) and the Duke of Cornwall (Regan's husband). Kent objects to Lear's unfair treatment of Cordelia; enraged by Kent's protests, Lear banishes him from the country. Lear then summons the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France, who have both proposed marriage to Cordelia. Learning that Cordelia has been disinherited, the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] withdraws his suit, but the King of France is impressed by her honesty and marries her nonetheless. The King of France is shocked by Lear's decision because up until this time Lear has only praised and favoured Cordelia (\"... she whom even but now was your best object, / The argument of your praise, balm of your age, ...\").{{sfd|King Lear|1|1|246\u2013248}} Meanwhile, Gloucester has introduced his illegitimate son Edmund to Kent.\n\n[[File:Edwin Austin Abbey King Lear, Act I, Scene I The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|''King Lear: Cordelia's Farewell'' by [[Edwin Austin Abbey]]]]\nLear announces he will live alternately with Goneril and Regan, and their husbands. He reserves to himself a retinue of 100 knights, to be supported by his daughters. Goneril and Regan speak privately, revealing that their declarations of love were fake and that they view Lear as a foolish old man.\n\nGloucester's bastard son Edmund resents his illegitimate status and plots to dispose of his legitimate older brother Edgar. He tricks his father with a forged letter, making him think that Edgar plans to usurp the estate. The Earl of Kent returns from exile in disguise (calling himself Caius), and Lear hires him as a servant. At Albany and Goneril's house, Lear and Kent quarrel with Oswald, Goneril's steward. Lear discovers that now that Goneril has power, she no longer respects him. She orders him to reduce the number of his disorderly retinue. Enraged, Lear departs for Regan's home. The Fool reproaches Lear with his foolishness in giving everything to Regan and Goneril and predicts that Regan will treat him no better.\n\n===Act II===\nEdmund learns from Curan, a courtier, that there is likely to be war between Albany and Cornwall and that Regan and Cornwall are to arrive at Gloucester's house that evening. Taking advantage of the arrival of the duke and Regan, Edmund fakes an attack by Edgar, and Gloucester is completely taken in. He disinherits Edgar and proclaims him an outlaw.\n\nBearing Lear's message to Regan, Kent meets Oswald again at Gloucester's home, quarrels with him again and is put in the stocks by Regan and her husband Cornwall. When Lear arrives, he objects to the mistreatment of his messenger, but Regan is as dismissive of her father as Goneril was. Lear is enraged but impotent. Goneril arrives and supports Regan's argument against him. Lear yields completely to his rage. He rushes out into a storm to rant against his ungrateful daughters, accompanied by the mocking Fool. Kent later follows to protect him. Gloucester protests against Lear's mistreatment. With Lear's retinue of a hundred knights dissolved, the only companions he has left are his Fool and Kent. Wandering on the [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] after the storm, Edgar, in the guise of a madman named [[Tom o' Bedlam]], meets Lear. Edgar babbles madly while Lear denounces his daughters. Kent leads them all to shelter.\n\n===Act III===\n[[File:Lear and the Fool III.ii.jpg|thumb|A watercolour of King Lear and the Fool in the storm from Act III, Scene ii, of ''King Lear'']]\nEdmund betrays Gloucester to Cornwall, Regan, and Goneril. He reveals evidence that his father knows of an impending French invasion designed to reinstate Lear to the throne; and in fact, a French army has landed in Britain. Once Edmund leaves with Goneril to warn Albany about the invasion, Gloucester is arrested, and Regan and Cornwall [[Eye-gouging|gouge out Gloucester's eyes]]. As they are doing this, a servant is overcome with rage by what he is witnessing and attacks Cornwall, mortally wounding him. Regan kills the servant and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him; then she turns him out to wander the heath, too.\n\n===Act IV===\nEdgar, in his madman's disguise, meets his blinded father on the heath. Gloucester, sightless and failing to recognise Edgar's voice, begs him to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience\u2014he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear and Gloucester\u2014and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan. After receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald that she is a more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off.\n\nOswald appears, still looking for Edmund. On Regan's orders, he tries to kill Gloucester but is killed by Edgar. In Oswald's pocket, Edgar finds Goneril's letter, in which she encourages Edmund to kill her husband and take her as his wife. Kent and Cordelia take charge of Lear, whose madness quickly passes. Regan, Goneril, Albany, and Edmund meet with their forces. Albany insists that they fight the French invaders but not harm Lear or Cordelia. The two sisters lust for Edmund, who has made promises to both. He considers the dilemma and plots the deaths of Albany, Lear, and Cordelia. Edgar gives Goneril's letter to Albany. The armies meet in battle, the British defeat the French, and Lear and Cordelia are captured. Edmund sends Lear and Cordelia off with secret-joint orders from him (representing Regan and her forces) and Goneril (representing the forces of her estranged husband, Albany) for the execution of Cordelia.\n\n===Act V===\n[[File:Lear and Cordelia (1849-54).jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Lear and Cordelia'' by [[Ford Madox Brown]]]]\n\nThe victorious British leaders meet, and the recently widowed Regan now declares she will marry Edmund. But Albany exposes the intrigues of Edmund and Goneril and proclaims Edmund a traitor. Regan falls ill, having been poisoned by Goneril, and is escorted offstage, where she dies. Edmund defies Albany, who calls for a [[trial by combat]]. Edgar appears masked and in armour and challenges Edmund to a duel. No one knows who he is. Edgar wounds Edmund fatally, though Edmund does not die immediately. Albany confronts Goneril with the letter which was intended to be his death warrant; she flees in shame and rage. Edgar reveals himself and reports that Gloucester died offstage from the shock and joy of learning that Edgar is alive, after Edgar revealed himself to his father.\n\nOffstage, Goneril, her plans thwarted, commits suicide. The dying Edmund decides, though he admits it is against his own character, to try to save Lear and Cordelia, but his confession comes too late. Soon after, Albany sends men to countermand Edmund's orders. Lear enters bearing Cordelia's corpse in his arms, having survived by killing the executioner. Kent appears and Lear now recognises him. Albany urges Lear to resume his throne, but as with Gloucester, the trials Lear has been through have finally overwhelmed him, and he dies. Albany then asks Kent and Edgar to take charge of the throne. Kent declines, explaining that his master is calling him on a journey and he must follow. Finally, Albany (in the quarto version) or Edgar (in the folio version) implies that he will now become king.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:1577 printing of Holinshed's Chronicles.jpg|thumb|The first edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande'', printed in 1577.]]\nShakespeare's play is based on various accounts of the semi-legendary [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] figure [[Leir of Britain]], whose name has been linked by some scholars to the Brythonic god [[Lir]]/[[Ll\u0177r]], though in actuality the names are not etymologically related.{{sfn|Jackson|1953|p=459}}{{sfn|Ekwall|1928|p=xlii}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1918}} Shakespeare's most important source is probably the second edition of ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles|The Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande]]'' by [[Raphael Holinshed]], published in 1587. Holinshed himself found the story in the earlier ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], which was written in the 12th century. [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', published 1590, also contains a character named Cordelia, who also dies from hanging, as in ''King Lear''.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nOther possible sources are the anonymous play ''[[King Leir]]'' (published in 1605); ''[[The Mirror for Magistrates]]'' (1574), by John Higgins; ''[[The Malcontent]]'' (1604), by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]; ''[[The London Prodigal]]'' (1605); [[Montaigne]]'s ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'', which were translated into English by [[John Florio]] in 1603; ''[[An Historical Description of Iland of Britaine]]'' (1577), by [[William Harrison (clergyman)|William Harrison]]; ''[[Remaines Concerning Britaine]]'' (1606), by [[William Camden]]; ''[[Albion's England]]'' (1589), by [[William Warner (poet)|William Warner]]; and ''[[A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures]]'' (1603), by [[Samuel Harsnett]], which provided some of the language used by Edgar while he feigns madness.{{sfn|Hadfield|2007|p=208}} ''King Lear'' is also a literary variant of a common [[Fable|folk tale]], [[Water and Salt|Love Like Salt]], [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 923, in which a father rejects his youngest daughter for a statement of her love that does not please him.{{sfn|Mitakidou|Manna|2002|p=100}}{{sfn|Ashliman|2013}}\n\nThe source of the subplot involving Gloucester, Edgar, and Edmund is a tale in [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (1580\u201390), with a blind [[Paphlagonia]]n king and his two sons, Leonatus and Plexitrus.{{sfn|McNeir|1968}}\n\n===Changes from source material===\nBesides the subplot involving the Earl of Gloucester and his sons, the principal innovation Shakespeare made to this story was the death of Cordelia and Lear at the end; in the account by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Cordelia restores Lear to the throne, and succeeds him as ruler after his death. During the 17th century, Shakespeare's tragic ending was much criticised and alternative versions were written by [[Nahum Tate]], in which the leading characters survived and Edgar and Cordelia were married (despite the fact that Cordelia was previously betrothed to the King of France).{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=53}} As [[Harold Bloom]] states: \"Tate's version held the stage for almost 150 years, until [[Edmund Kean]] reinstated the play's tragic ending in 1823.\"{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=53}}\n\n==Date and text==\n[[File:Houghton STC 22292 - M. William Shak-speare, 1608.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the [[first quarto]] edition, published in 1608]]\nThere is no direct evidence to indicate when ''King Lear'' was written or first performed.  It is thought to have been composed sometime between 1603 and 1606. A [[Stationers' Register]] entry notes a performance before James I on 26 December 1606. The 1603 date originates from words in Edgar's speeches which may derive from [[Samuel Harsnett]]'s ''Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures'' (1603).{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1249}} A significant issue in the dating of the play is the relationship of ''King Lear'' to the play titled ''The True Chronicle History of the Life and Death of King Leir and his Three Daughters'', which was published for the first time after its entry in the Stationers' Register of 8 May 1605. This play had a significant effect on Shakespeare, and his close study of it suggests that he was using a printed copy, which suggests a composition date of 1605\u201306.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=89\u201390}} Conversely, Frank Kermode, in the ''Riverside Shakespeare'', considers the publication of ''Leir'' to have been a response to performances of Shakespeare's already-written play; noting a sonnet by [[William Strachey]] that may have verbal resemblances with ''Lear'', Kermode concludes that \"1604\u201305 seems the best compromise\".{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1250}}\n\nA line in the play that regards \"These late eclipses in the sun and moon\"<ref>''King Lear'', 1.2.103</ref> appears to refer to a phenomenon of two eclipses that occurred over London within a few days of each other\u2014the lunar eclipse of 27 September 1605 and the solar eclipse of 12 October 1605.  This remarkable pair of events stirred up much discussion among astrologers. Edmund's line \"A prediction I read this other day\u2026\"<ref>''King Lear'', 1.2.139</ref> apparently refers to the published prognostications of the astrologers, which followed after the eclipses.  This suggests that those lines in Act I were written sometime after both the eclipses and the published comments.{{sfn|Shaheen|1999|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Second Folio Title Page of King Lear.jpg|thumb|left|The first page of ''King Lear'', printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]The modern text of ''King Lear'' derives from three sources: two quartos, one published in 1608 (Q<sub>1</sub>) and the other in 1619 (Q<sub>2</sub>),{{efn|The 1619 quarto is part of William Jaggard's so-called [[False Folio]].}} and the version in the First Folio of 1623 (F<sub>1</sub>). The differences between these versions are significant. Q<sub>1</sub> contains 285 lines not in F<sub>1</sub>; F<sub>1</sub> contains around 100 lines not in Q<sub>1</sub>. Also, at least a thousand individual words are changed between the two texts, each text has different styles of punctuation, and about half the verse lines in the F<sub>1</sub> are either printed as prose or differently divided in the Q<sub>1</sub>. Early editors, beginning with [[Alexander Pope]], conflated the two texts, creating the modern version that has been commonly used since. The conflated version originated with the assumptions that the differences in the versions do not indicate any re-writing by the author; that Shakespeare wrote only one original manuscript, which is now lost; and that the Quarto and Folio versions contain various distortions of that lost original. Other editors, such as Nuttall and Bloom, have suggested Shakespeare himself maybe have been involved in reworking passages in the play to accommodate performances and other textual requirements of the play.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=xii}}\n\nAs early as 1931, [[Madeleine Doran]] suggested that the two texts had independent histories, and that these differences between them were critically interesting. This argument, however, was not widely discussed until the late 1970s, when it was revived, principally by Michael Warren and [[Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor]], who discuss a variety of theories including Doran's idea that the Quarto may have been printed from Shakespeare's [[foul papers]], and that the Folio may have been printed from a promptbook prepared for a production.{{sfn|Taylor|Warren|1983|p=429}}\n\nThe New Cambridge Shakespeare has published separate editions of Q and F; the most recent Pelican Shakespeare edition contains both the 1608 Quarto and the 1623 Folio text as well as a conflated version; the New Arden edition edited by [[R.A. Foakes]] offers a conflated text that indicates those passages that are found only in Q or F. Both Anthony Nuttall of Oxford University and Harold Bloom of Yale University have endorsed the view of Shakespeare having revised the tragedy at least once during his lifetime.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=xii}} As Bloom indicates: \"At the close of Shakespeare's revised ''King Lear'', a reluctant Edgar becomes King of Britain, accepting his destiny but in the accents of despair.

Danby, in his ''Shakespeare's Doctrine of Nature \u2013 A Study of King Lear'' (1949), argues that ''Lear'' dramatizes, among other things, the current meanings of \"Nature.\" The words \"nature,\" \"natural,\" and \"unnatural\" occur over forty times in the play, reflecting a debate in Shakespeare's time about what nature really was like; this debate pervades the play and finds symbolic expression in Lear's changing attitude to Thunder. There are two strongly contrasting views of human nature in the play: that of the Lear party (Lear, Gloucester, Albany, Kent), exemplifying the philosophy of [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Richard Hooker|Hooker]], and that of the Edmund party (Edmund, Cornwall, Goneril, Regan), akin to the views later formulated by [[Hobbes]], though the latter had not yet begun his philosophy career when ''Lear'' was first performed. Along with the two views of Nature, the play contains two views of Reason, brought out in Gloucester and Edmund's speeches on astrology (1.2). The rationality of the Edmund party is one with which a modern audience more readily identifies. But the Edmund party carries bold rationalism to such extremes that it becomes madness: a madness-in-reason, the ironic counterpart of Lear's \"reason in madness\" (IV.6.190) and the Fool's wisdom-in-folly. This betrayal of reason lies behind the play's later emphasis on ''feeling''.\n\nThe two Natures and the two Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is the New Man, a member of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in contrast with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. ''King Lear'' is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new [[Niccol\u00f2_Machiavelli#Beliefs|Machiavellianism]]; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king's rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare's understanding of the New Man is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism\u2014the energy, the emancipation, the courage\u2014which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. \"He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. But he makes an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society. It is not right to assert the kind of man Edmund would erect to this supremacy.\"{{sfn|Danby|1949|p=50}}\n\nThe play offers an alternative to the feudal-Machiavellian polarity, an alternative foreshadowed in France's speech (I.1.245\u2013256), in Lear and Gloucester's prayers (III.4. 28\u201336; IV.1.61\u201366), and in the figure of Cordelia. Until the decent society is achieved, we are meant to take as role-model (though qualified by Shakespearean ironies) Edgar, \"the machiavel of goodness,\"{{sfn|Danby|1949|p=151}} endurance, courage and \"ripeness.\"{{sfn|Danby|1949|p=50}}\n\n[[File:Three daughters of King Lear by Gustav Pope.JPG|thumb|''Three daughters of King Lear'' by [[Gustav Pope]]]]\n\nThe play also contains references to disputes between King James I and Parliament. In the 1604 elections to the House of Commons, [[John Fortescue of Salden|Sir John Fortescue]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was defeated by a member of the Buckinghamshire gentry, [[Francis Goodwin (MP)|Sir Francis Goodwin]].{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=103}} Displeased with the result, James declared the result of the [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghhamshire]] election invalid, and swore in Fortescue as the MP for Buckinghamshire while the House of Commons insisted on swearing in Goodwin, leading to a clash between King and Parliament over who had the right to decide who sat in the House of Commons.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=103}} The MP [[Thomas Wentworth (Recorder of Oxford)|Thomas Wentworth]], the son of another MP [[Peter Wentworth]]\u2014often imprisoned under Elizabeth for raising the question of the succession in the Commons\u2014was most forceful in protesting James's attempts to reduce the powers of the House of Commons, saying the King could not just declare the results of an election invalid if he disliked who had won the seat as he was insisting that he could.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} The character of Kent resembles Peter Wentworth in the way which is tactless and blunt in advising Lear, but his point is valid that Lear should be more careful with his friends and advisers.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}}\n\nJust as the House of Commons had argued to James that their loyalty was to the constitution of England, not to the King personally, Kent insists his loyalty is institutional, not personal, as he is loyal to the realm of which the king is head, not to Lear himself, and he tells Lear to behave better for the good of the realm.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} By contrast, Lear makes an argument similar to James that as king, he holds absolute power and could disregard the views of his subjects if they displease him whenever he liked.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} In the play, the characters like the Fool, Kent and Cordelia, whose loyalties are institutional, seeing their first loyalty to the realm, are portrayed more favorably than those like Regan and Goneril, who insist they are only loyal to the king, seeing their loyalties as personal.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=105}} Likewise, James was notorious for his riotous, debauched lifestyle and his preference for sycophantic courtiers who were forever singing his praises out of the hope for advancement, aspects of his court that closely resemble the court of King Lear, who starts out in the play with a riotous, debauched court of sycophantic courtiers.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=105\u2013106}} Kent criticises Oswald as a man unworthy of office who has only been promoted because of his sycophancy, telling Lear that he should be loyal to those who are willing to tell him the truth, a statement that many in England wished that James would heed.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nFurthermore, James VI of Scotland inherited the throne of England upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, thereby uniting all of the kingdoms of the British isles into one, and a major issue of his reign was the attempt to forge a common British identity.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=98\u201399}} James had given his sons Henry and Charles the titles of Duke of Cornwell and Duke of Albany, the same titles bore by the men married to Regan and Goneril.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=99}} The play begins with Lear ruling all of Britain and ends with him destroying his realm; the critic Andrew Hadfield argued that the division of Britain by Lear was an inversion of the unification of Britain by James, who believed his policies would result in a well governed and prosperous unified realm being passed on to his heir.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=99}} Hadfield argued that the play was meant as a warning to James as in the play a monarch loses everything by giving in to his sycophantic courtiers who only seek to use him while neglecting those who truly loved him.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|p=99}} Hadfield also argued that the world of Lear's court is \"childish\" with Lear presenting himself as the father of the nation and requiring all of his subjects, not just his children, to address him in paternal terms, which infantises most of the people around him, which pointedly references James's statement in his 1598 book ''The Trew Law of Free Monarchies'' that the king is the \"father of the nation,\" for whom all of his subjects are his children.{{sfn|Hadfield|2004|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\n===Psychoanalytic and psychosocial interpretations===\n''King Lear'' provides a basis for \"the primary enactment of psychic breakdown in English literary history\".{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=19}} The play begins with Lear's \"near-fairytale narcissism\".{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=20}}\n\nGiven the absence of legitimate mothers in ''King Lear'', [[Copp\u00e9lia Kahn]]{{sfn|Kahn|1986}} provides a psychoanalytic interpretation of the \"maternal subtext\" found in the play. According to Kahn, Lear's old age forces him to regress into an infantile disposition, and he now seeks a love that is traditionally satisfied by a mothering woman, but in the absence of a real mother, his daughters become the mother figures. Lear's contest of love between Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia serves as the binding agreement; his daughters will get their inheritance provided that they care for him, especially Cordelia, on whose \"kind nursery\" he will greatly depend.\n\nCordelia's refusal to dedicate herself to him and love him as more than a father has been interpreted by some as a resistance to incest, but Kahn also inserts the image of a rejecting mother. The situation is now a reversal of parent-child roles, in which Lear's madness is a childlike rage due to his deprivation of filial/maternal care. Even when Lear and Cordelia are captured together, his madness persists as Lear envisions a nursery in prison, where Cordelia's sole existence is for him. It is only with Cordelia's death that his fantasy of a daughter-mother ultimately diminishes, as ''King Lear'' concludes with only male characters living.\n\n[[File:Lear and Cordelia in Prison c1779 N 05189 B 53 Pen and watercolour 123\u00d7175 by William Blake.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|''Lear and Cordelia in Prison'' \u2013 [[William Blake]] circa&nbsp;1779]]\n[[Sigmund Freud]] asserted that Cordelia symbolises Death. Therefore, when the play begins with Lear rejecting his daughter, it can be interpreted as him rejecting death; Lear is unwilling to face the finitude of his being. The play's poignant ending scene, wherein Lear carries the body of his beloved Cordelia, was of great importance to Freud. In this scene, Cordelia forces the realization of his finitude, or as Freud put it, she causes him to \"make friends with the necessity of dying\".{{sfn|Freud|1997|p=120}} Shakespeare had particular intentions with Cordelia's death, and was the only writer to have Cordelia killed (in the version by the Nahum Tate, she continues to live happily, and in Holinshed's, she restores her father and succeeds him).\n\nAlternatively, an analysis based on [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] theory suggests that the King's contest among his daughters in Act I has more to do with his control over the unmarried Cordelia.{{sfn|McLaughlin|1978|p=39}} This theory indicates that the King's \"dethronement\"{{sfn|Croake|1983|p=247}} might have led him to seek control that he lost after he divided his land.\n\nIn his study of the character-portrayal of Edmund, Harold Bloom refers to him as \"Shakespeare's most original character\".{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=317}}\n\n\"As Hazlitt pointed out\", writes Bloom, \"Edmund does not share in the hypocrisy of Goneril and Regan: his Machiavellianism is absolutely pure, and lacks an Oedipal motive. Freud's vision of family romances simply does not apply to Edmund. Iago is free to reinvent himself every minute, yet Iago has strong passions, however negative. Edmund has no passions whatsoever; he has never loved anyone, and he never will. In that respect, he is Shakespeare's most original character.\"{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe tragedy of Lear's lack of understanding of the consequences of his demands and actions is often observed to be like that of a spoiled child, but it has also been noted that his behaviour is equally likely to be seen in parents who have never adjusted to their children having grown up.{{sfn|Kamaralli|2015}}\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:King Lear and Cordelia (West, 1793).jpg|thumb|A 1793 painting of King Lear and Cordelia by [[Benjamin West]].]]\nCritics are divided on the question of whether or not ''King Lear'' represents an affirmation of a particular Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Peat|1982|p=43}} Those who maintain this position posit different arguments, which include the significance of Lear's self-divestment.{{sfn|Kronenfeld|1998|p=181}} For some critics, this reflects the Christian concepts of the fall of the mighty and the inevitable loss of worldly possessions. By 1569, sermons delivered at court such as those at Windsor declared how \"rich men are rich dust, wise men wise dust... From him that weareth purple, and beareth the crown down to him that is clad with meanest apparel, there is nothing but garboil, and ruffle, and hoisting, and lingering wrath, and fear of death and death itself, and hunger, and many a whip of God.\"{{sfn|Kronenfeld|1998|p=181}} Some see this in Cordelia and what she symbolized\u2014that the material body are mere husks that would eventually be discarded so that the fruit can be reached.{{sfn|Peat|1982|p=43}}\n\nAmong those who argue that Lear is redeemed in the Christian sense through suffering are [[A.C. Bradley]]{{sfn|Bradley|1905|p=285}} and John Reibetanz, who has written: \"through his sufferings, Lear has won an enlightened soul\".{{sfn|Reibetanz|1977|p=108}} Other critics who find no evidence of redemption and emphasise the horrors of the final act include [[John Holloway (poet)|John Holloway]]{{sfn|Holloway|1961|p=}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} and Marvin Rosenberg.{{sfn|Rosenberg|1992|p=}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} William R. Elton stresses the pre-Christian setting of the play, writing that, \"Lear fulfills the criteria for pagan behavior in life,\" falling \"into total blasphemy at the moment of his irredeemable loss\".{{sfn|Elton|1988|p=260}} This is related to the way some sources cite that at the end of the narrative, King Lear raged against heaven before eventually dying in despair with the death of Cordelia.{{sfn|Pierce|2008|p=xx}}\n\n==Performance history==\n''King Lear'' has been performed by esteemed actors since the 17th&nbsp;century, when men played all the roles. From the 20th&nbsp;century, a number of women have played male roles in the play; most commonly the Fool, who has been played (among others) by [[Judy Davis]], [[Emma Thompson]] and [[Robyn Nevin]]. Lear himself has been played by [[Marianne Hoppe]] in 1990,{{sfn|Croall|2015|p=70}} by [[Janet Wright]] in 1995,{{sfn|Nestruck|2016}} by [[Kathryn Hunter]] in 1996\u201397,{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=171}} and by [[Glenda Jackson]] in 2016 and 2019.{{sfn|Cavendish|2016}}\n\n=== 17th century ===\n[[File:LearTate.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of [[Nahum Tate|Tate]]'s ''The History of King Lear'']]\nShakespeare wrote the role of Lear for his company's chief tragedian, [[Richard Burbage]], for whom Shakespeare was writing incrementally older characters as their careers progressed.{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=5}} It has been speculated either that the role of the Fool was written for the company's clown [[Robert Armin]], or that it was written for performance by one of the company's [[Boy player|boys]], doubling the role of Cordelia.{{sfn|Thomson|2002|p=143}}{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=6}} Only one specific performance of the play during Shakespeare's lifetime is known: before the court of [[James I of England|King James I]] at Whitehall on 26 December 1606.{{sfn|Hunter|1972|p=45}}{{sfn|Taylor|2002|pp=18\u201319}} Its original performances would have been at [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]], where there were no sets in the modern sense, and characters would have signified their roles visually with props and costumes: Lear's costume, for example, would have changed in the course of the play as his status diminished: commencing in crown and regalia; then as a huntsman; raging bareheaded in the storm scene; and finally crowned with flowers in parody of his original status.{{sfn|Gurr|Ichikawa|2000|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAll theatres were closed down by the [[Puritan]] government on 6 September 1642. Upon the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]]) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=21}} And from the restoration until the mid-19th century the performance history of ''King Lear'' is not the story of Shakespeare's version, but instead of ''[[The History of King Lear]]'', a popular adaptation by [[Nahum Tate]]. Its most significant deviations from Shakespeare were to omit the Fool entirely, to introduce a happy ending in which Lear and Cordelia survive, and to develop a love story between Cordelia and Edgar (two characters who never interact in Shakespeare) which ends with their marriage.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=324\u2013325}} Like most Restoration adapters of Shakespeare, Tate admired Shakespeare's natural genius but saw fit to augment his work with contemporary standards of art (which were largely guided by the neoclassical [[unities]] of time, place, and action).{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=43}} Tate's struggle to strike a balance between raw nature and refined art is apparent in his description of the tragedy: \"a heap of jewels, unstrung and unpolish't; yet so dazzling in their disorder, that I soon perceiv'd I had seiz'd a treasure.\"{{sfn|Armstrong|2003|p=312}}{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=190}} Other changes included giving Cordelia a ''confidante'' named Arante, bringing the play closer to contemporary notions of [[poetic justice]], and adding titilating material such as amorous encounters between Edmund and both Regan and Goneril, a scene in which Edgar rescues Cordelia from Edmund's attempted kidnap and rape,{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=186}}{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=28}} and a scene in which Cordelia wears men's pants that would reveal the actress's ankles.{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=47}} The play ends with a celebration of \"the King's blest Restauration\",<!-- sic --> an obvious reference to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].{{efn|Jean I.

For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' on 16 April 1711 [[Joseph Addison]] wrote \"''King Lear'' is an admirable Tragedy ... as ''Shakespeare'' wrote it; but as it is reformed according to the chymerical Notion of poetical Justice in my humble Opinion it hath lost half its Beauty.\"<!-- sic, as regards italics and capitalisation throughout, and the spelling of \"chymerical\" --> Yet on the stage, Tate's version prevailed.{{efn|Quoted by Jean I. Marsden.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=30}}}}\n\n[[David Garrick]] was the first actor-manager to begin to cut back on elements of Tate's adaptation in favour of Shakespeare's original: he retained Tate's major changes, including the happy ending, but removed many of Tate's lines, including Edgar's closing speech.{{sfn|Tatspaugh|2003|p=528}} He also reduced the prominence of the Edgar-Cordelia love story, in order to focus more on the relationship between Lear and his daughters.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=33}} His version had a powerful emotional impact: Lear driven to madness by his daughters was (in the words of one spectator, Arthur Murphy) \"the finest tragic distress ever seen on any stage\" and, in contrast, the devotion shown to Lear by Cordelia (a mix of Shakespeare's, Tate's and Garrick's contributions to the part) moved the audience to tears.{{efn|Jean I. Marsden cites ''Gray's Inn Journal'' 12 January 1754.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=33}}}}\n\nThe first professional performances of ''King Lear'' in North America are likely to have been those of the [[American Company|Hallam Company]] (later the American Company) which arrived in Virginia in 1752 and who counted the play among their repertoire by the time of their departure for Jamaica in 1774.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=232}}\n\n=== 19th century ===\n[[File:James Barry 002.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|''King Lear mourns Cordelia's death'', [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], 1786\u20131788]]\n\n[[Charles Lamb]] established the [[Romanticism|Romantics]]' attitude to ''King Lear'' in his 1811 essay \"On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, considered with reference to their fitness for stage representation\" where he says that the play \"is essentially impossible to be represented on the stage\", preferring to experience it in the study. In the theatre, he argues, \"to see Lear acted, to see an old man tottering about the stage with a walking-stick, turned out of doors by his daughters on a rainy night, has nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting\" yet \"while we read it, we see not Lear but we are Lear,\u2014we are in his mind, we are sustained by a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters and storms.\"{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=40}}{{sfn|Hunter|1972|p=50}}\n\n''King Lear'' was politically controversial during the period of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s madness, and as a result was not performed at all in the two professional theatres of London from 1811 to 1820: but was then the subject of major productions in both, within three months of his death.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=189}} The 19th century saw the gradual reintroduction of Shakespeare's text to displace Tate's version. Like [[David Garrick|Garrick]] before him, [[John Philip Kemble]] had introduced more of Shakespeare's text, while still preserving the three main elements of Tate's version: the love story, the omission of the Fool, and the happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances.{{sfn|Potter|2001|pp=190\u2013191}}{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=62}} At last in 1838, [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden performed Shakespeare's version, freed from Tate's adaptions.{{sfn|Potter|2001|pp=190\u2013191}} The restored character of the Fool was played by an actress, [[Priscilla Horton]], as, in the words of one spectator, \"a fragile, hectic, beautiful-faced, half-idiot-looking boy.\"{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=191}} And [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=161}} [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], writing in the ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|Examiner]]'' on 14 February 1838, expressed the hope that \"Mr Macready's success has banished that disgrace [Tate's version] from the stage for ever.\"{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=73}} But even this version was not close to Shakespeare's: the 19th-century actor-managers heavily cut Shakespeare's scripts: ending scenes on big \"curtain effects\" and reducing or eliminating supporting roles to give greater prominence to the star.{{sfn|Hunter|1972|p=51}} One of Macready's innovations\u2014the use of [[Stonehenge]]-like structures on stage to indicate an ancient setting\u2014proved enduring on stage into the 20th century, and can be seen in the 1983 television version starring [[Laurence Olivier]].{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nIn 1843, the [[Theatres Act 1843|Act for Regulating the Theatres]] came into force, bringing an end to the monopolies of the two existing companies and, by doing so, increased the number of theatres in London.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=191}} At the same time, the fashion in theatre was \"pictorial\": valuing visual spectacle above plot or characterisation and often required lengthy (and time-consuming) scene changes.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=58\u201375}} For example, [[Henry Irving]]'s 1892 ''King Lear'' offered spectacles such as Lear's death beneath a cliff at Dover, his face lit by the red glow of a setting sun; at the expense of cutting 46% of the text, including the blinding of Gloucester.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=193}} But Irving's production clearly evoked strong emotions: one spectator, Gordon Crosse, wrote of the first entrance of Lear, \"a striking figure with masses of white hair. He is leaning on a huge scabbarded sword which he raises with a wild cry in answer to the shouted greeting of his guards. His gait, his looks, his gestures, all reveal the noble, imperious mind already degenerating into senile irritability under the coming shocks of grief and age.\"{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=206}}\n\nThe importance of pictorialism to Irving, and to other theatre professionals of the Victorian era, is exemplified by the fact that Irving had used [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''Cordelia's Portion'' as the inspiration for the look of his production, and that the artist himself was brought in to provide sketches for the settings of other scenes.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|p=63}} A reaction against pictorialism came with the rise of the reconstructive movement, believers in a simple style of staging more similar to that which would have pertained in renaissance theatres, whose chief early exponent was the actor-manager [[William Poel]]. Poel was influenced by a performance of ''King Lear'' directed by Jocza Savits at the Hoftheater in Munich in 1890, set on an [[apron stage]] with a three-tier [[Globe Theatre|Globe]]\u2014like reconstruction theatre as its backdrop. Poel would use this same configuration for his own Shakespearean performances in 1893.{{sfn|O'Connor|2002|p=78}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Cordelia's Portion.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Cordelia's Portion'' by [[Ford Madox Brown]]]]\n\nBy mid-century, the actor-manager tradition had declined, to be replaced by a structure where the major theatre companies employed professional directors as auteurs. The last of the great actor-managers, [[Donald Wolfit]], played Lear in 1944 on a Stonehenge-like set and was praised by [[James Agate]] as \"the greatest piece of Shakespearean acting since I have been privileged to write for the ''Sunday Times''\".{{efn|Quoted by Stanley Wells.{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=224}}}}{{sfn|Foakes|1997|p=89}} Wolfit supposedly drank eight bottles of Guinness in the course of each performance.{{efn|According to [[Ronald Harwood]], quoted by Stanley Wells.{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=229}}}}\n\nThe character of Lear in the 19th century was often that of a frail old man from the opening scene, but Lears of the 20th century often began the play as strong men displaying regal authority, including [[John Gielgud]], [[Donald Wolfit]] and [[Donald Sinden]].{{sfn|Foakes|1997|p=24}} Cordelia, also, evolved in the 20th century: earlier Cordelias had often been praised for being sweet, innocent and modest, but 20th-century Cordelias were often portrayed as war leaders. For example, [[Peggy Ashcroft]], at the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|RST]] in 1950, played the role in a breastplate and carrying a sword.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=36\u201337}} Similarly, the Fool evolved through the course of the century, with portrayals often deriving from the [[music hall]] or [[circus]] tradition.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|p=52}}\n\nAt Stratford-upon-Avon in 1962 [[Peter Brook]] (who would later film the play with the same actor, [[Paul Scofield]], in the role of Lear) set the action simply, against a huge, empty white stage. The effect of the scene when Lear and Gloucester meet, two tiny figures in rags in the midst of this emptiness, was said (by the scholar Roger Warren) to catch \"both the human pathos ... and the universal scale ... of the scene.\"{{sfn|Warren|1986|p=266}} Some of the lines from the radio broadcast were used by [[The Beatles]] to add into the recorded mix of the song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". [[John Lennon]] happened upon the play on the [[BBC Third Programme]] while fiddling with the radio while working on the song. The voices of actors [[Mark Dignam]], [[Philip Guard]], and John Bryning from the play are all heard in the song.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=134\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=128}}\n\nLike other Shakespearean tragedies, ''King Lear'' has proved amenable to conversion into other theatrical traditions. In 1989, David McRuvie and Iyyamkode Sreedharan adapted the play then translated it to [[Malayalam]], for performance in [[Kerala]] in the [[Kathakali]] tradition\u2014which itself developed around 1600, contemporary with Shakespeare's writing. The show later went on tour, and in 2000 played at [[Shakespeare's Globe]], completing, according to Anthony Dawson, \"a kind of symbolic circle\".{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=178}} Perhaps even more radical was [[Ong Keng Sen]]'s 1997 adaptation of ''King Lear'', which featured six actors each performing in a separate Asian acting tradition and in their own separate languages. A pivotal moment occurred when the [[Peking opera|Jingju]] performer playing Older Daughter (a conflation of Goneril and Regan) stabbed the [[Noh]]-performed Lear whose \"falling pine\" deadfall, straight face-forward into the stage, astonished the audience, in what Yong Li Lan describes as a \"triumph through the moving power of ''noh'' performance at the very moment of his character's defeat\".{{sfn|Lan|2005|p=532}}{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|p=265}}\n\nIn 1974, [[Buzz Goodbody]] directed ''Lear'', a deliberately abbreviated title for Shakespeare's text, as the inaugural production of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]]'s studio theatre [[The Other Place (theatre)|The Other Place]]. The performance was conceived as a chamber piece, the small intimate space and proximity to the audience enabled detailed psychological acting, which was performed with simple sets and in modern dress.{{sfn|Holland|2001|p=211}} Peter Holland has speculated that this company/directoral decision\u2014namely ''choosing'' to present Shakespeare in a small venue for artistic reasons when a larger venue was available\u2014may at the time have been unprecedented.{{sfn|Holland|2001|p=211}}\n\nBrook's earlier vision of the play proved influential, and directors have gone further in presenting Lear as (in the words of [[R.A. Foakes]]) \"a pathetic senior citizen trapped in a violent and hostile environment\". When [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] took the role in 1990, he played the later scenes in clothes that looked like cast-offs, inviting deliberate parallels with the uncared-for in modern Western societies.{{sfn|Foakes|1997|pp=27\u201328}} Indeed, modern productions of Shakespeare's plays often reflect the world in which they are performed as much as the world for which they were written: and the Moscow theatre scene in 1994 provided an example, when two very different productions of the play (those by Sergei Zhonovach and Alexei Borodin), very different from one another in their style and outlook, were both reflections on the break-up of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Holland|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2002 and 2010, the [[Hudson Shakespeare Company]] of New Jersey staged separate productions as part of their respective [[Shakespeare in the Park festivals|Shakespeare in the Parks]] seasons. The 2002 version was directed by Michael Collins and transposed the action to a West Indies, nautical setting. Actors were featured in outfits indicative of looks of various Caribbean islands. The 2010 production directed by Jon Ciccarelli was fashioned after the atmosphere of the film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' with a palette of reds and blacks and set the action in an urban setting. Lear (Tom Cox) appeared as a head of multi-national conglomerate who divided up his fortune among his socialite daughter Goneril (Brenda Scott), his officious middle daughter Regan (Noelle Fair) and university daughter Cordelia (Emily Best).{{sfn|Beckerman|2010}}\n\nIn 2012, renowned Canadian director Peter Hinton directed an all-[[First Nations]] production of ''King Lear'' at the [[National Arts Centre]] in Ottawa, Ontario, with the setting changed to an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] nation in the 17th century.{{sfn|Nestruck|2012}} The cast included [[August Schellenberg]] as Lear, [[Billy Merasty]] as Gloucester, [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as Regan, [[Kevin Loring]] as Edmund, [[Jani Lauzon]] in a dual role as Cordelia and the Fool, and [[Craig Lauzon]] as Kent.{{sfn|Nestruck|2012}} This setting would later be reproduced as part of the ''Manga Shakespeare'' graphic novel series published by Self-Made Hero, adapted by Richard Appignanesi and featuring the illustrations of Ilya.\n\nIn 2015 Toronto's [[Theatre Passe Muraille]] staged a production set in Upper Canada against the backdrop of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837.

About the madness at the heart of the play, Rush said that for him \"it's about finding the dramatic impact in the moments of his mania. What seems to work best is finding a vulnerability or a point of empathy, where an audience can look at Lear and think how shocking it must be to be that old and to be banished from your family into the open air in a storm. That's a level of impoverishment you would never want to see in any other human being, ever.\"{{sfn|Blake|2015}}\n\nIn 2016 [[Talawa Theatre Company]] and [[Royal Exchange Manchester]] co-produced a production of ''King Lear'' with [[Don Warrington]] in the title role.{{sfn|Hutchison|2015}} The production, featuring a largely black cast, was described in ''The Guardian'' as being \"as close to definitive as can be\".{{sfn|Hickling|2016}} ''The Daily Telegraph'' wrote that \"Don Warrington's King Lear is a heartbreaking tour de force\".{{sfn|Allfree|2016}} ''King Lear'' was staged by [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], with Antony Sher in the lead role.

Of these, the version by director Gerolamo Lo Savio was filmed on location, and it dropped the Edgar sub-plot and used frequent intertitling to make the plot easier to follow than its Vitagraph predecessor.{{efn|This version appears on the British Film Institute video compilation ''Silent Shakespeare'' (1999).{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=84}}}} A contemporary setting was used for [[Louis Feuillade]]'s 1911 French adaptation ''Le Roi Lear Au Village'', and in 1914 in America, Ernest Warde expanded the story to an hour, including spectacles such as a final battle scene.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=205\u2013206}}\n\nThe [[Joseph L.

At the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made, it tells the story of Hidetora, a fictional 16th-century Japanese warlord, whose attempt to divide his kingdom among his three sons leads to an estrangement with the youngest, and ultimately most loyal, of them, and eventually to civil war.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=84}} In contrast to the cold drab greys of Brook and Kozintsev, Kurosawa's film is full of vibrant colour: external scenes in yellows, blues and greens, interiors in browns and ambers, and [[Emi Wada]]'s [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Oscar]]-winning colour-coded costumes for each family member's soldiers.{{sfn|Guntner|2007|p=136}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=84}} Hidetora has a back-story: a violent and ruthless rise to power, and the film portrays contrasting victims: the virtuous characters Sue and Tsurumaru who are able to forgive, and the vengeful Kaede ([[Mieko Harada]]), Hidetora's daughter-in-law and the film's [[Lady Macbeth]]-like villain.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=84\u201387}}{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=225}}\n\n[[File:House-of-strangers-trailer.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|Screenshot from trailer for ''[[House of Strangers]]'' (1949)<br>\"The film has two antecedents\u2014biblical references to Joseph and his brothers and ''King Lear''\".{{sfn|Griggs|2009|p=122}}]]\nA scene in which a character is threatened with blinding in the manner of Gloucester forms the climax of the 1973 parody horror ''[[Theatre of Blood]]''.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=85}} Comic use is made of Sir's inability to physically carry any actress cast as Cordelia opposite his Lear in the [[The Dresser (1983 film)|1983 film]] of the stage play ''[[The Dresser]]''.{{sfn|McKernan|Terris|1994|p=87}} [[John Boorman]]'s 1990 ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' features a father who disinherits his three spoiled children.{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=308}} [[Francis Ford Coppola]] deliberately incorporated elements of ''Lear'' in his 1990 sequel ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', including Michael Corleone's attempt to retire from crime throwing his domain into anarchy, and most obviously the death of his daughter in his arms. Parallels have also been drawn between [[Andy Garc\u00eda]]'s character Vincent and both Edgar and Edmund, and between [[Talia Shire]]'s character Connie and Kaede in ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''.{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=299}}\n\nIn 1997 [[Jocelyn Moorhouse]] directed ''[[A Thousand Acres (film)|A Thousand Acres]]'', based on [[Jane Smiley]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, set in 1990s Iowa.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|p=88}} The film is described, by scholar Tony Howard, as the first adaptation to confront the play's disturbing sexual dimensions.{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=299}} The story is told from the viewpoint of the elder two daughters, Ginny played by [[Jessica Lange]] and Rose played by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who were sexually abused by their father as teenagers. Their younger sister Caroline, played by [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] had escaped this fate and is ultimately the only one to remain loyal.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Brode|2001|p=217}}\n\nThe play was adapted to the world of gangsters in [[Don Boyd]]'s 2001 ''[[My Kingdom (film)|My Kingdom]]'', a version which differs from all others in commencing with the Lear character, Sandeman, played by [[Richard Harris]], in a loving relationship with his wife. But her violent death marks the start of an increasingly bleak and violent chain of events (influenced by co-writer Nick Davies' documentary book ''Dark Heart'') which in spite of the director's denial that the film had \"serious parallels\" to Shakespeare's play, actually mirror aspects of its plot closely.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=90\u201391}}{{sfn|Lehmann|2006|pp=72\u201389}} Unlike Shakespeare's Lear, but like Hidetora and Sandeman, the central character of [[Uli Edel]]'s 2002 American TV adaptation ''[[King of Texas]]'', John Lear played by [[Patrick Stewart]], has a back-story centred on his violent rise to power as the richest landowner (metaphorically a \"king\") in General [[Sam Houston]]'s independent Texas in the early 1840s. Daniel Rosenthal comments that the film was able, by reason of having been commissioned by the cable channel TNT, to include a bleaker and more violent ending than would have been possible on the national networks.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2007|pp=92\u201393}} 2003's [[Channel 4]]-commissioned two-parter ''Second Generation'' set the story in the world of Asian manufacturing and music in England.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|Shaughnessy|2006|p=99}}\n\nThe 2006 Chinese film ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' is based loosely on ''King Lear'', but the plot is set in [[Tang Dynasty]] China instead of Medieval Europe.\n\nIn 2008, a version of ''[[King Lear (2008 film)|King Lear]]'' produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company premiered with [[Ian McKellen]] in the role of King Lear.\n\nIn the 2012 romantic comedy ''If I Were You'', there is a reference to the play when the lead characters are cast in a female version of King Lear set in modern times, with Marcia Gay Harden cast in the Lear role and [[Lenore Watling]] as \"the fool.\" Lear is an executive in a corporate empire instead of a literal one, being phased out of her position. The off-beat play (and its cast) is a major plot element of the movie.\n\n[[Carl Bessai]] wrote and directed a modern adaptation of ''King Lear'' titled ''[[The Lears]]''. Released in 2017, the film starred [[Bruce Dern]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]] and [[Sean Astin]].{{sfn|McNary|2016}}\n\nOn 28 May 2018, BBC Two broadcast ''[[King Lear (2018 film)|King Lear]]'' starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the title role and [[Emma Thompson]] as Goneril. Directed by [[Richard Eyre]], the play featured a 21st-century setting. Hopkins, at the age of 80, was deemed ideal for the role and \"at home with Lear's skin\" by critic Sam Wollaston.{{sfn|Wollaston|2018}}\n\n===Radio and audio===\nThe first recording of the Argo Shakespeare for [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo Records]] was ''King Lear'' in 1957, directed and produced by George Rylands with [[William Devlin (actor)|William Devlin]] in the title role, [[Jill Balcon]] as Goneril and [[Prunella Scales]] as Cordelia.{{sfn|Quinn|2017}}\n\nThe Shakespeare Recording Society recorded a full-length unabridged audio productions on LP in 1965 (SRS-M-232) directed by [[Howard Sackler]], with [[Paul Scofield]] as Lear, [[Cyril Cusack]] as Gloucester. [[Robert Stephens]] as Edmund, [[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]], [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]] and [[John Stride]].\n\n''King Lear'' was broadcast live on the BBC Third Programme on 29 September 1967, starring [[John Gielgud]], [[Barbara Jefford]], Barbara Bolton and [[Virginia McKenna]] as Lear and his daughters.{{sfn|Radio Times|1967}} At [[Abbey Road Studios]], [[John Lennon]] used a microphone held to a radio to overdub fragments of the play (Act IV, Scene 6) onto the song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\", which [[The Beatles]] were recording that evening. The voices recorded were those of [[Mark Dignam]] (Gloucester), [[Philip Guard]] (Edgar) and John Bryning (Oswald).{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=134\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=128}}\n\nOn 10 April 1994, [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s [[Renaissance Theatre Company]] performed a radio adaptation directed by [[Glyn Dearman]] starring Gielgud as Lear, with [[Keith Michell]] as Kent, [[Richard Briers]] as Gloucester, [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]] as Goneril, [[Emma Thompson]] as Cordelia, [[Eileen Atkins]] as Regan, [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Edmund, [[John Shrapnel]] as Albany, [[Robert Stephens]] as Cornwall, [[Denis Quilley]] as Burgundy, [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] as France, [[Iain Glen]] as Edgar and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as The Fool.{{sfn|Radio Times|1994}}\n\n===Opera===\nGerman composer [[Aribert Reimann]]'s opera ''[[Lear (opera)|Lear]]'' premiered on 9 July 1978.\n\nJapanese composer's [[Toshio Hosokawa]]'s opera ''[[Vision of Lear]]'' premiered on 18 April 1998 at the [[Munich Biennale]].\n\nFinnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]]'s opera ''[[Kuningas Lear]]'' premiered on 15 September 2000.\n\n=== Novels ===\nOn 27 March 2018, Tessa Gratton published a high fantasy adaptation of ''King Lear'' titled ''The Queens of Innis Lear'' with Tor Books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tessagratton.com/tessa/novels.html|title=Novels|website=tessagratton.com|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Illegitimacy in fiction]]\n* [[Nothing comes from nothing]]\n* [[Shakespearean fool]]\n* [[Fool (novel)|''Fool'' (novel)]]\n* [[Water and Salt]]\n* [[Cap-o'-Rushes]]\n* [[The Goose-Girl at the Well]]\n* [[The Dirty Shepherdess]]\n* [[The Yiddish King Lear]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist|40em}}\n\n===References===\n{{refbegin}}\nAll references to ''King Lear'', unless otherwise specified, are taken from the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]'s ''Folger Digital Editions'' texts edited by Barbara Mowat, Paul Werstine, Michael Poston, and Rebecca Niles.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nIn the breakout scenario, the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the attack helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nIn the 1950s, the [[NATO]] response to an attack by the WTO would be \"massive retaliation\" with [[tactical nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999-07/features/natos-nuclear-weapons-rationale-first-use |title=NATO's Nuclear Weapons: The Rationale for 'No First Use' |first=Jack |last=Mendelsohn |website=Arms Control Today}}</ref> and conventional forces were seen as secondary. By the early 1970s this resulted in a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} The 1969 [[Nixon Doctrine]]'s [[flexible response]] strategy required a non-nuclear answer to this disparity. The Ansbach Tests suggested this could be a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet.\n\nThis sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contest resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was eventually canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nAs might be expected, in the breakout scenario the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft.

The [[Dragon Ball (manga)|initial manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', as well as [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named [[Bulma]], who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <onlyinclude>\n\nToriyama's [[manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (TV series)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|20 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996\u20131997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015\u20132018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]]. ''Dragon Ball'' is one of the top twenty [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]], having generated more than {{US$|20 billion|long=no}} in total franchise revenue as of 2018</onlyinclude>.<ref name=\"sfchronicle\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Dragon Ball'' has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 40{{nbsp}}countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80{{nbsp}}countries. The manga's 42 collected ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes have sold over 160{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more 250{{ndash}}300 million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, behind only ''[[One Piece]]''.<!-- This is referenced in the reception section below. --> Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular across the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global [[popular culture]], referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers across the world.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Dragon Ball story takes place on Earth where Goku goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, as well as aspiring to become a great fighter, and compete in multiple martial arts tournaments. Goku later stops the evil Red Ribbon Army, then 3 years later, thwarts the Grand Demon King Piccolo's plans for world conquest, afterwards he and his friends protect the Earth from the Saiyan invasion. The setting also goes to Planet Namek later on in the series for Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn to revive Goku's fallen friends from the Saiyan's attack, where they encounter Vegeta's higher ups, as well as the cosmic emperor, Freeza.\n\nThe ''Dragon Ball'' franchise is set in a [[multiverse]]<ref>''SOS from the Future: A Dark New Enemy Appears!'', [[Funimation]] dub</ref> composed of twelve{{refn|name=Multiverse|group=N|Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.}} numbered universes, each ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction. Almost all of the ''Dragon Ball'' series, except for parts of ''Dragon Ball Super'', takes place in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called \"Ages\", with most of the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790.\n\nUniverse 7 contains several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside, and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet Vegeta.\n\n''[[Dr. Slump]]'', an earlier manga series by Akira Toriyama, is set in the same multiverse.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters|Dragon Ball (manga)#Production}}\n[[File:Akira Toriyama.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Akira Toriyama]], the creator of ''Dragon

The [[Dragon Ball (manga)|initial manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', as well as [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named [[Bulma]], who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <onlyinclude>\n\nToriyama's [[manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (TV series)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|20 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996\u20131997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015\u20132018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]].

The manga's 42 collected ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes have sold over 160{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more 250{{ndash}}300 million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, behind only ''[[One Piece]]''.<!-- This is referenced in the reception section below. --> Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular across the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global [[popular culture]], referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers across the world.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Dragon Ball story takes place on Earth where Goku goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, as well as aspiring to become a great fighter, and compete in multiple martial arts tournaments. Goku later stops the evil Red Ribbon Army, then 3 years later, thwarts the Grand Demon King Piccolo's plans for world conquest, afterwards he and his friends protect the Earth from the Saiyan invasion. The setting also goes to Planet Namek later on in the series for Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn to revive Goku's fallen friends from the Saiyan's attack, where they encounter Vegeta's higher ups, as well as the cosmic emperor, Freeza.\n\nThe ''Dragon Ball'' franchise is set in a [[multiverse]]<ref>''SOS from the Future: A Dark New Enemy Appears!'', [[Funimation]] dub</ref> composed of twelve{{refn|name=Multiverse|group=N|Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.}} numbered universes, each ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction. Almost all of the ''Dragon Ball'' series, except for parts of ''Dragon Ball Super'', takes place in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called \"Ages\", with most of the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790.\n\nUniverse 7 contains several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside, and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet Vegeta.\n\n''[[Dr. Slump]]'', an earlier manga series by Akira Toriyama, is set in the same multiverse.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters|Dragon Ball (manga)#Production}}\n[[File:Akira Toriyama.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Akira Toriyama]], the creator of ''Dragon
