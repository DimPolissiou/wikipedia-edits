It stars [[Jennifer Grey]] as Frances \"Baby\" Houseman, a young woman who falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle ([[Patrick Swayze]]) at a holiday resort.\n\nThe film was based on screenwriter [[Eleanor Bergstein]]'s own childhood. She originally wrote a screenplay for the [[Michael Douglas]] film ''[[It's My Turn (film)|It's My Turn]]'', but ultimately ended up conceiving a story for a film which became ''Dirty Dancing''. She finished the script in 1985, but management changes at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] put the film in [[development hell]]. The production company was changed to [[Vestron Pictures]] with Emile Ardolino as director and Linda Gottlieb as producer. Filming took place in [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]], and [[Mountain Lake (Virginia)|Mountain Lake, Virginia]], with the film's score composed by John Morris and dance choreography by [[Kenny Ortega]].\n\n''Dirty Dancing'' premiered at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 12, 1987, and was released on August 21, 1987, in the United States, earning over $214 million worldwide.<ref name=singh-2010>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6193195/Patrick-Swayze-the-man-who-inspired-a-generation-of-women-to-dance-has-died.html|date=September 16, 2009|title=Patrick Swayze, the man who inspired a generation of women to dance, has died|accessdate=January 9, 2010|author=Singh, Anita|work=The Telegraph | location=London}}</ref> It was the first film to sell more than a million copies for home video,<ref name=singh-2010/> and its [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] created by [[Jimmy Ienner]] generating two multi-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] albums and multiple singles, including \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]\", which won both the [[Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and a [[Grammy Award]] for best duet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Save the Last Dirty Dance for the Revival; Movies: 'Dirty Dancing,' the Catskills love story with forbidden footwork, steps out again for its 10th birthday.|author=Craughwell, Kathleen|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 18, 1997}}</ref> The film's popularity led to a 2004 [[prequel]], ''[[Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights]]'', and a stage version which has had sellout performances in Australia, Europe, and North America.

Exploring one night, Baby secretly observes Max instructing the waiters, all [[Ivy League]] students, to romance the guests' daughters, no matter how unattractive. She also sees Max demeaning the [[working class]] entertainment staff, including 25-year-old Johnny Castle, one of the resort's dance instructors. Baby is attracted to Johnny, and dances briefly with him when his cousin, Billy, takes her to one of the staff's secret \u201cdirty\u201d dancing parties.\n\nBaby learns Johnny's dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who attends [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale medical school]] and who now has his eye on Lisa.  When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby, without giving a reason, borrows money from her father Jake to pay for Penny's [[abortion]]. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and Johnny to miss a performance at another nearby resort, costing them the season's salary, but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny.  During her dance sessions with Johnny, they develop a mutual attraction, and except for their failure to execute a climactic lift, Johnny and Baby's performance is successful.\n\nBack at Kellerman's, Penny is gravely injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father's help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby's deception, and assuming Johnny got Penny pregnant, Jake orders Baby to stay away from him.  Baby sneaks off to apologize to Johnny for her dad's treatment of him, but Johnny feels he deserves it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his own worth and then declares her love for him. The two continue seeing each other, but Baby keeps it secret from her father, who now refuses to talk to her.\n\n[[File:Dirty-dancing-coverx-large.jpg|right|thumb|A scene from the dancing finale<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|author=Vernon, Polly|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1868781,00.html |title=Hey Baby&nbsp;\u2013 we're all Swayze now|date=October 10, 2006| work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 15, 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=bbc/>]]\n\nJohnny rejects an indecent proposal by Vivian Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie, foiling Lisa's own plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving Johnny's cabin, she attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming he stole her husband's wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up his alibi, revealing she was with him during the time frame of the theft. The real thieves Sydney and Silvia Schumacher are caught, but Johnny is still fired because of Baby.  Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Jake, but is only accused of now trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to Jake for lying, but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses Jake of class prejudice.\n\nAt the end-of-season talent show, Jake gives Robbie money for medical school, but when Robbie admits that he got Penny pregnant, and then insults her and Baby, Jake angrily grabs the money back. Johnny arrives and disrupts the final song by bringing Baby up on stage and declaring that she has made him a better person, and then they do the dance they practiced all summer, ending with a successful performance of the climactic lift. Jake admits he was wrong about Johnny and reconciles with Baby, and all the staff and guests join Baby and Johnny dancing to \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Johnny Castle\n* [[Jennifer Grey]] as Frances \u201cBaby\u201d Houseman\n* [[Cynthia Rhodes]] as Penny Johnson\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Jake Houseman\n* [[Jane Brucker]] as Lisa Houseman\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Max Kellerman\n* [[Lonny Price]] as Neil Kellerman\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Marjorie Houseman\n* Antone Pag\u00e1n as The Staff Kid\n* [[Max Cantor]] as Robbie Gould\n* [[Charles Coles]] as Tito Suarez\n* [[Neal Jones]] as Billy Kostecki\n* [[Miranda Garrison]] as Vivian Pressman\n* [[Garry Goodrow]] as Moe Pressman\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Stan\n* [[Paula Trueman]] as Sylvia Schumacher\n* Alvin Myerovich as Sydney Schumacher\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{see also|Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)}}\n{{Div col}}\n# \"[[Be My Baby]]\" \u2013 [[The Ronettes]]\n# \"[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]\" \u2013 [[Frankie Valli]] and [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]\n# \"Where Are You Tonight?\" \u2013 [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]]\n# \"[[Do You Love Me]]\" \u2013 [[The Contours]]\n# \"[[Love Man]]\" \u2013 [[Otis Redding]]\n# \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\" \u2013 [[Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs]]\n# \"[[Hungry Eyes]]\" \u2013 [[Eric Carmen]]\n# \"Overload\" \u2013 [[Zappacosta]]\n# \"[[Hey!

Thirty-nine percent of people who viewed the film did not realize abortion was the subplot. In May 1987, the film was screened for producer [[Aaron Russo]].

Marketers of the [[Clearasil]] acne product liked the film, seeing it as a vehicle to reach a teen target audience. However, when they learned the film contained an abortion scene, they asked for that part of the plot to be cut. As Bergstein refused, the Clearasil promotion was dropped. Consequently, Vestron promoted the film themselves and set the premiere on August 16, 1987.

Somebody who taught me about the kind of person I want to be: Miss Frances Houseman.\"</ref>]]\nVarious images and lines from the film have worked their way into popular culture. Johnny Castle's line, \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\", has been used in song lyrics, as the title of the \"[[Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner]]\" episode of the TV series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and as the title of a [[Fall Out Boy]] song. \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" was also quoted in ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'': when [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] says the line concerning his beloved Impala and his brother [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] retorts that the line is from a Swayze movie; Dean responds: \"Swayze always gets a pass\". The line was parodied in the webcomic ''[[Looking for Group]]'' where Richard, one of the primary characters, uttered a variation involving his own name, and in ''[[Family Guy]]'', where the scene is parodied by Baby's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth. In Sweden, feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" (in English) in white neon light at [[Ume\u00e5]] Bus Square (2008) and at [[Karlstad University]] (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sistersofjam.com/category/nobody-puts-baby-in-a-corner/|title=Nobody Puts Baby In a Corner|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''[[Family Guy]]'' also parodies the scene where Baby first sees Johnny dancing with the staff. In the TV series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', [[Barney Stinson]] attempts to pass off the ''Dirty Dancing'' story as the story of his own loss of virginity because he is ashamed of his actual story; the original \"Love is Strange\" scene is shown with Barney replacing Johnny.\n\nThe famous lift scene is also widely referenced in popular culture. In the 2011 film ''[[Crazy, Stupid, Love]]'' Ryan Gosling's character is able to perform the \u201cmove from ''Dirty Dancing''\u201d and does it with Emma Stone's character.  In the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' the famous lift dance sequence was rehearsed for the 2018 wedding of Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlow and was also performed to \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life|The Time of My Life]]\" as in the film.\n\nThe French film ''[[Heartbreaker (2010 film)|Heartbreaker]]'' (2010) pays homage to the film, as a plot detail, with some clips from the film shown and a \"recreation\" by the two main characters of the \"lift\" scene.\n\nIn the first episode of the TV series ''[[New Girl]]'', the female lead Jess watches the film repeatedly after her break up. Jess continues to repeatedly watch the film after various break-ups throughout the series.\n\nSince 2009, there has been a Dirty Dancing Festival in [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/08/01/dirty-dancing-lake-lure-filming-location/2600115/ |title=North Carolina town hosts 'Dirty Dancing' festival |date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Alternate versions==\n\n===Stage version===\nThe film was adapted for the stage in 2004 as a musical, ''Dirty Dancing: The Classic Story on Stage''.

Exploring one night, Baby secretly observes Max instructing the waiters, all [[Ivy League]] students, to romance the guests' daughters, no matter how unattractive. She also sees Max demeaning the [[working class]] entertainment staff, including 25-year-old Johnny Castle, one of the resort's dance instructors. Baby is attracted to Johnny, and dances briefly with him when his cousin, Billy, takes her to one of the staff's secret \u201cdirty\u201d dancing parties.\n\nBaby learns Johnny's dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who attends [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale medical school]] and who now has his eye on Lisa.  When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby, without giving a reason, borrows money from her father Jake to pay for Penny's [[abortion]]. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and Johnny to miss a performance at another nearby resort, costing them the season's salary, but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny.  During her dance sessions with Johnny, they develop a mutual attraction, and except for their failure to execute a climactic lift, Johnny and Baby's performance is successful.\n\nBack at Kellerman's, Penny is gravely injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father's help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby's deception, and assuming Johnny got Penny pregnant, Jake orders Baby to stay away from him.  Baby sneaks off to apologize to Johnny for her dad's treatment of him, but Johnny feels he deserves it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his own worth and then declares her love for him. The two continue seeing each other but Baby keeps it secret from her father who now refuses to talk to her.\n\n[[File:Dirty-dancing-coverx-large.jpg|right|thumb|A scene from the dancing finale<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|author=Vernon, Polly|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1868781,00.html |title=Hey Baby&nbsp;\u2013 we're all Swayze now|date=October 10, 2006| work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 15, 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=bbc/>]]\n\nJohnny rejects an indecent proposal by Vivian Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie foiling Lisa's own plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving Johnny's cabin she attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming he stole her husband's wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up his alibi, revealing she was with him during the time frame of the theft. The real thieves Sydney and Silvia Schumacher are caught, but Johnny is still fired because of Baby.  Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Jake, but is only accused of now trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to Jake for lying, but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses Jake of class prejudice.\n\nAt the end-of-season talent show, Jake gives Robbie money for medical school, but when Robbie admits that he got Penny pregnant, and then insults her and Baby, Jake angrily grabs the money back. Johnny arrives and disrupts the final song by bringing Baby up on stage and declaring that she has made him a better person, and then they do the dance they practiced all summer, ending with a successful performance of the climactic lift. Jake admits he was wrong about Johnny and reconciles with Baby, and all the staff and guests join Baby and Johnny dancing to \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Johnny Castle\n* [[Jennifer Grey]] as Frances \u201cBaby\u201d Houseman\n* [[Cynthia Rhodes]] as Penny Johnson\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Jake Houseman\n* [[Jane Brucker]] as Lisa Houseman\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Max Kellerman\n* [[Lonny Price]] as Neil Kellerman\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Marjorie Houseman\n* Antone Pag\u00e1n as The Staff Kid\n* [[Max Cantor]] as Robbie Gould\n* [[Charles Coles]] as Tito Suarez\n* [[Neal Jones]] as Billy Kostecki\n* [[Miranda Garrison]] as Vivian Pressman\n* [[Garry Goodrow]] as Moe Pressman\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Stan\n* [[Paula Trueman]] as Sylvia Schumacher\n* Alvin Myerovich as Sydney Schumacher\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{see also|Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)}}\n{{Div col}}\n# \"[[Be My Baby]]\" \u2013 [[The Ronettes]]\n# \"[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]\" \u2013 [[Frankie Valli]] and [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]\n# \"Where Are You Tonight?\" \u2013 [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]]\n# \"[[Do You Love Me]]\" \u2013 [[The Contours]]\n# \"[[Love Man]]\" \u2013 [[Otis Redding]]\n# \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\" \u2013 [[Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs]]\n# \"[[Hungry Eyes]]\" \u2013 [[Eric Carmen]]\n# \"Overload\" \u2013 [[Zappacosta]]\n# \"[[Hey!

Somebody who taught me about the kind of person I want to be: Miss Frances Houseman.\"</ref>]]\nVarious images and lines from the film have worked their way into popular culture. Johnny Castle's line, \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\", has been used in song lyrics, as the title of the \"[[Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner]]\" episode of the TV series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and as the title of a [[Fall Out Boy]] song. \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" was also quoted in ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'': when [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] says the line concerning his beloved Impala and his brother [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] retorts that the line is from a Swayze movie; Dean responds: \"Swayze always gets a pass\". The line was parodied in the webcomic ''[[Looking for Group]]'' where Richard, one of the primary characters, uttered a variation involving his own name, and in ''[[Family Guy]]'', where the scene is parodied by Baby's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth. In Sweden, feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" (in English) in white neon light at [[Ume\u00e5]] Bus Square (2008) and at [[Karlstad University]] (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sistersofjam.com/category/nobody-puts-baby-in-a-corner/|title=Nobody Puts Baby In a Corner|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''[[Family Guy]]'' also parodies the scene where Baby first sees Johnny dancing with the staff. In the TV series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', [[Barney Stinson]] attempts to pass off the ''Dirty Dancing'' story as the story of his own loss of virginity because he is ashamed of his actual story; the original \"Love is Strange\" scene is shown with Barney replacing Johnny.\n\nThe famous lift scene is also widely referenced in popular culture. In the 2011 film ''[[Crazy, Stupid, Love]]'' Ryan Gosling's character is able to perform the \u201cmove from ''Dirty Dancing''\u201d and does it with Emma Stone's character.  In the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' the famous lift dance sequence was rehearsed for the 2018 wedding of Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlow and was also performed to \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life|The Time of My Life]]\" as in the film.\n\nThe French film ''[[Heartbreaker (2010 film)|Heartbreaker]]'' (2010) pays homage to the film, as a plot detail, with some clips from the film shown and a \"recreation\" by the two main characters of the \"lift\" scene.\n\nIn the first episode of the TV series ''[[New Girl]]'', the female lead Jess watches the film repeatedly after her break up. Jess continues to repeatedly watch the film after various break-ups throughout the series.\n\nSince 2009, there has been a Dirty Dancing Festival in [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/08/01/dirty-dancing-lake-lure-filming-location/2600115/ |title=North Carolina town hosts 'Dirty Dancing' festival |date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Alternate versions==\n\n===Stage version===\nThe film was adapted for the stage in 2004 as a musical, ''Dirty Dancing: The Classic Story on Stage''.

It was one of the last in a line of SHREK species, beginning with ''[[Mammuthus subplanifrons]]'' in the early [[Pliocene]]. The woolly SHREK began to diverge from the [[steppe SHREK]] about 800,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the [[Asian elephant]]. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in [[Siberia]] and [[Alaska]], as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of [[legendary creature]]s. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1796.\n\nThe woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern [[African elephant]]s. Males reached shoulder heights between {{convert|2.7|and|3.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and weighed up to {{convert|6|MT|ST}}. Females reached {{convert|2.6|-|2.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in shoulder heights and weighed up to {{convert|4|MT|ST}}. A newborn calf weighed about {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the [[coat (animal)|coat]] varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise [[frostbite]] and heat loss. It had long, curved [[tusk]]s and four [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the [[mammoth steppe]], which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago. Isolated populations survived on [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|St. Paul Island]] until 5,600 years ago and on [[Wrangel Island]] until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its [[ivory]] as a raw material, a tradition that continues today.

The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting, such as fights over [[Territory (animal)|territory]] or mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a [[flyswatter]], similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;95\u2013105</ref> The well-preserved foot of the adult male \"[[Yukagir mammoth]]\" shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 82 87\"/>\n\nLike modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in [[matriarchal]] (female-led) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. So, most of their other social behaviours probably were similar to those of modern elephants. How many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. The numbers likely varied by season and lifecycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;62\u201363</ref> Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300\u201311,000 years ago have been found in the [[St. Mary Reservoir]] in Canada, showing that in this case almost equal numbers of adults, subadults, and juveniles were found. The adults had a stride of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the juveniles ran to keep up.<ref name=\"Trackway\"/>\n\n===Adaptations to cold===\n[[File:Woolly Mammoth Overhair (x250).tif|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a woolly mammoth overhair, 250X magnification]]\nThe woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and [[withers]], for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of \"Yuka\" and other specimens was suggested to function as a \"fur mitten\"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal.<ref name=\"Yuka trunk\"/> As in [[reindeer]] and [[musk oxen]], the [[haemoglobin]] of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live at high latitudes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J. E. E. | last3 = Watson | first3 = L.

About 1.4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin, which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild-type mice, and have wavier hair. Also, several alterations in circadian clock genes were found, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.<ref name=\"Lynch2015\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.027| pmid = 26146078| title = Elephantid genomes reveal the molecular bases of Woolly Mammoth adaptations to the arctic| year = 2015| last1 = Lynch | first1 = V. | last2 = Bedoya-Reina | first2 = O.

Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grasses and sedges, which were supplemented with [[herbaceous plant]]s, [[flowering plant]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[moss]]es, and tree matter. The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location. Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of 6 tons would need to eat {{convert|180|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} daily, and may have [[foraged]] as long as 20 hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last [[ice age]] ([[Quaternary glaciation]], 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking [[bud]]s and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present.

The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;92\u201395</ref>\n\n===Life history===\n[[File:Mammoth tusk slice.jpg|thumb|left|Cross sectioned tusk with [[growth rings]], which can be used to determine the age of specimens]]\nThe lifespan of mammals is related to their size, and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years, the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths, which were of a similar size. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the [[growth rings]] of its tusks when viewed in cross section, but this does not account for its early years, as these are represented by the tips of the tusks, which are usually worn away. In the remaining part of the tusk, each major line represents a year, and weekly and daily ones can be found in between. Dark bands correspond to summers, so determining the season in which a mammoth died is possible. The growth of the tusks slowed when foraging became harder, for example during winter, during disease, or when a male was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of 10). Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25\u201320,000 years ago show slower growth rates. Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood, like other elephants. Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40, and females grew until they were 25. The frozen calf \"Dima\" was {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall when it died at the age of 6\u201312 months. At this age, the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting, and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for 10 years, and this process was repeated until the final, sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old. When the last set of molars was worn out, the animal would be unable to chew and feed, and it would die of starvation. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;83\u2013107.</ref><ref name=\"Herbert2010\">{{cite web | url = https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | title = A Mammoth Find: Clues to the Past, Present and Future | last = Herbert | first = B. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = D. | date = 5 May 2010 | website = Helix | publisher = [[Northwestern University]] | access-date = 1 August 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818074348/https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | archivedate = 18 August 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Yukagir mammoth head.jpg|thumb|Head of the adult male \"Yukagir mammoth\"; the trunk is not preserved]]\nThe best-preserved head of a frozen adult specimen, that of a male nicknamed the \"Yukagir mammoth\", shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye.<ref name=\"Yukagir\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mol | first1 = D.| last2 = Shoshani| first2 = J. | last3 = Tikhonov | first3 = A. | last4 = van Geel | first4 = B. | last5 = Sano | first5 = S. | last6 = Lasarev | first6 = P.| last7 = Agenbroad| first7 = L. | title = The Yukagir mammoth: brief history, 14c dates, individual age, gender, size, physical and environmental conditions and storage | journal = Scientific Annals, School of Geology Aristotle University of Thessaloniki | volume = 98 | pages = 299\u2013314 | year = 2006}}</ref> This feature indicates that, like bull elephants, male woolly mammoths also entered \"[[musth]]\", a period of heightened aggressiveness.

Before this, [[Neanderthals]] had coexisted with mammoths during the [[Middle Palaeolithic]], and already used mammoth bones for tool-making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. [[William Buckland]] published his discovery of the [[Red Lady of Paviland]] skeleton in 1823, which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, [[\u00c9douard Lartet]] found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the [[Abri de la Madeleine]] cave in [[Dordogne]], France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;116\u2013117</ref>\n[[File:KM - Altsteinzeit Mammut.jpg|thumb|Replica of a roughly 26,000-year-old ivory carving depicting a mammoth, Krahuletz-Museum]]\nThe woolly mammoth is the third-most depicted animal in ice-age art, after horses and bison, and these images were produced between 35,000 and 11,500 years ago. Today, more than 500 depictions of woolly mammoths are known, in media ranging from cave paintings and engravings on the walls of 46 caves in Russia, France, and Spain to engravings and sculptures (termed \"[[portable art]]\") made from ivory, antler, stone and bone. Cave paintings of woolly mammoths exist in several styles and sizes. The French [[Rouffignac Cave]] has the most depictions, 159, and some of the drawings are more than {{convert|2|m|ft}} in length. Other notable caves with mammoth depictions are the [[Chauvet Cave]], [[Les Combarelles Cave]], and [[Font-de-Gaume]].<ref name=\"Lister 2007 118 125\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;118\u2013125</ref> A depiction in the [[Cave of El Castillo]] may instead show ''[[Palaeoloxodon]]'', the \"straight-tusked elephant\".<ref name=art>{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = I.

The largest collection of portable mammoth art, consisting of 62 depictions on 47 plaques, was found in the 1960s at an excavated open-air camp near [[G\u00f6nnersdorf]] in Germany. A correlation between the number of mammoths depicted and the species that were most often hunted does not seem to exist, since reindeer bones are the most frequently found animal remains at the site.

Large bones were used as foundations for the huts, tusks for the entrances, and the roofs were probably skins held in place by bones or tusks. Some huts had floors that extended {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} below ground. Some huts included fireplaces, which used bones as fuel, probably because wood was scarce. Some of the bones used for materials may have come from mammoths killed by humans, but the state of the bones, and the fact that bones used to build a single dwelling varied by several thousands of years in age, suggests that they were collected remains of long-dead animals. Woolly mammoth bones were also made into various tools, furniture, and musical instruments. Large bones, such as shoulder blades, were also used to cover dead human bodies during burial.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;128\u2013132</ref>\n[[File:Venus of Brassempouy.jpg|thumb|The [[Venus of Brassempouy]], made from woolly mammoth ivory, [[National Archaeological Museum, France]]]]\nWoolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects. Several [[Venus figurines]], including the [[Venus of Brassempouy]] and the [[Venus of Lespugue]], were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a [[boomerang]], are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiseled, and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and how this was achieved is unknown.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;131\u2013137</ref>\n\nSeveral woolly mammoth specimens show evidence of being butchered by humans, which is indicated by breaks, cut marks, and associated stone tools. How much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat is unknown, since many other large herbivores were available. Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps. Few specimens show direct, unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans.

Black points are records of mammoths, black lines are the northern limit of humans]]\nMost woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early [[Holocene]], alongside most of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the [[Quaternary extinction event]], which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the [[Chaunsky District|Kyttyk Peninsula]] of Siberia 9,650 years ago.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = A.

Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue. Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed \"[[elephants' graveyard]]s\", as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found;  these are thought to be the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years, and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams. Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Natural traps, such as [[kettle holes]], [[sink holes]], and mud, have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 45 75\"/>\n\nApart from frozen remains, the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a [[petroleum seep]] in [[Starunia]], Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of [[Siberia]] and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the [[Arctic Circle]], in permafrost. Soft tissue apparently was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This \"[[natural mummification]]\" required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt, mud, and icy water, which then froze.<ref name=\"Lister, 2007. pp. 50\u201353\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;50\u201353</ref>\n\nThe presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure is likely.

One of its shoulder blades was broken, which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse. It may have died of [[asphyxiation]], as indicated by its erect penis.

In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed \"Effie\", which was found in 1948.

The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today, it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as \"white gold\". Local dealers estimate that  10 million mammoths are still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 [[Lausanne]] Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the [[Schreger lines]] are coarser in texture.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;137\u2013139</ref> In the 21st century, [[global warming]] has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it.<ref name=\"Larmer2015\">{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|title=Mammoth Tusk Hunters|website=nationalgeographic.com|date=April 2013|last=Larmer|first=B.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402004219/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|archivedate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:La fuite devant le mammouth.jpg|upright|thumb|''La fuite devant le mammouth'', [[Paul Jamin]], 1885]]\nStories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted, especially that of the \"Berezovka mammoth\", but most of these are considered dubious.

It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with ''[[Mammuthus subplanifrons]]'' in the early [[Pliocene]]. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the [[steppe mammoth]] about 800,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the [[Asian elephant]]. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in [[Siberia]] and [[Alaska]], as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of [[legendary creature]]s. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1796.\n\nThe woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern [[African elephant]]s. Males reached shoulder heights between {{convert|2.7|and|3.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and weighed up to {{convert|6|MT|ST}}. Females reached {{convert|2.6|-|2.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in shoulder heights and weighed up to {{convert|4|MT|ST}}. A newborn calf weighed about {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the [[coat (animal)|coat]] varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise [[frostbite]] and heat loss. It had long, curved [[tusk]]s and four [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the [[mammoth steppe]], which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago. Isolated populations survived on [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|St. Paul Island]] until 5,600 years ago and on [[Wrangel Island]] until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its [[ivory]] as a raw material, a tradition that continues today.

The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;92\u201393</ref> The woolly mammoth is considered to have had the most complex molars of any elephant.<ref name=\"Kurten & Anderson\"/>\n\nDistortion in the molars is the most common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. Sometimes, the replacement was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had [[periodontal disease]], with half of these containing [[caries]]. The teeth also sometimes had [[cancerous]] growths.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;108\u2013109</ref>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Ant\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|[[Life restoration]] of fauna during the Pleistocene epoch in northern Spain, by [[Mauricio Ant\u00f3n]], 2004]]\nAdult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as [[wolves]], [[cave hyena]]s and large [[felidae|felines]]. The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting, such as fights over [[Territory (animal)|territory]] or mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a [[flyswatter]], similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;95\u2013105</ref> The well-preserved foot of the adult male \"[[Yukagir mammoth]]\" shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 82 87\"/>\n\nLike modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in [[matriarchal]] (female-led) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. So, most of their other social behaviours probably were similar to those of modern elephants. How many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. The numbers likely varied by season and lifecycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;62\u201363</ref> Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300\u201311,000 years ago have been found in the [[St. Mary Reservoir]] in Canada, showing that in this case almost equal numbers of adults, subadults, and juveniles were found. The adults had a stride of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the juveniles ran to keep up.<ref name=\"Trackway\"/>\n\n===Adaptations to cold===\n[[File:Woolly Mammoth Overhair (x250).tif|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a woolly mammoth overhair, 250X magnification]]\nThe woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and [[withers]], for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of \"Yuka\" and other specimens was suggested to function as a \"fur mitten\"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal.<ref name=\"Yuka trunk\"/> As in [[reindeer]] and [[musk oxen]], the [[haemoglobin]] of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live at high latitudes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J. E. E. | last3 = Watson | first3 = L.

About 1.4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin, which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild-type mice, and have wavier hair. Also, several alterations in circadian clock genes were found, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.<ref name=\"Lynch2015\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.027| pmid = 26146078| title = Elephantid genomes reveal the molecular bases of Woolly Mammoth adaptations to the arctic| year = 2015| last1 = Lynch | first1 = V. | last2 = Bedoya-Reina | first2 = O.

Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grasses and sedges, which were supplemented with [[herbaceous plant]]s, [[flowering plant]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[moss]]es, and tree matter. The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location. Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of 6 tons would need to eat {{convert|180|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} daily, and may have [[foraged]] as long as 20 hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last [[ice age]] ([[Quaternary glaciation]], 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking [[bud]]s and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present.

The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;92\u201395</ref>\n\n===Life history===\n[[File:Mammoth tusk slice.jpg|thumb|left|Cross sectioned tusk with [[growth rings]], which can be used to determine the age of specimens]]\nThe lifespan of mammals is related to their size, and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years, the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths, which were of a similar size. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the [[growth rings]] of its tusks when viewed in cross section, but this does not account for its early years, as these are represented by the tips of the tusks, which are usually worn away. In the remaining part of the tusk, each major line represents a year, and weekly and daily ones can be found in between. Dark bands correspond to summers, so determining the season in which a mammoth died is possible. The growth of the tusks slowed when foraging became harder, for example during winter, during disease, or when a male was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of 10). Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25\u201320,000 years ago show slower growth rates. Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood, like other elephants. Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40, and females grew until they were 25. The frozen calf \"Dima\" was {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall when it died at the age of 6\u201312 months. At this age, the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting, and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for 10 years, and this process was repeated until the final, sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old. When the last set of molars was worn out, the animal would be unable to chew and feed, and it would die of starvation. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;83\u2013107.</ref><ref name=\"Herbert2010\">{{cite web | url = https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | title = A Mammoth Find: Clues to the Past, Present and Future | last = Herbert | first = B. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = D. | date = 5 May 2010 | website = Helix | publisher = [[Northwestern University]] | access-date = 1 August 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818074348/https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | archivedate = 18 August 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Yukagir mammoth head.jpg|thumb|Head of the adult male \"Yukagir mammoth\"; the trunk is not preserved]]\nThe best-preserved head of a frozen adult specimen, that of a male nicknamed the \"Yukagir mammoth\", shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye.<ref name=\"Yukagir\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mol | first1 = D.| last2 = Shoshani| first2 = J. | last3 = Tikhonov | first3 = A. | last4 = van Geel | first4 = B. | last5 = Sano | first5 = S. | last6 = Lasarev | first6 = P.| last7 = Agenbroad| first7 = L. | title = The Yukagir mammoth: brief history, 14c dates, individual age, gender, size, physical and environmental conditions and storage | journal = Scientific Annals, School of Geology Aristotle University of Thessaloniki | volume = 98 | pages = 299\u2013314 | year = 2006}}</ref> This feature indicates that, like bull elephants, male woolly mammoths also entered \"[[musth]]\", a period of heightened aggressiveness.

Before this, [[Neanderthals]] had coexisted with mammoths during the [[Middle Palaeolithic]], and already used mammoth bones for tool-making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. [[William Buckland]] published his discovery of the [[Red Lady of Paviland]] skeleton in 1823, which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, [[\u00c9douard Lartet]] found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the [[Abri de la Madeleine]] cave in [[Dordogne]], France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;116\u2013117</ref>\n[[File:KM - Altsteinzeit Mammut.jpg|thumb|Replica of a roughly 26,000-year-old ivory carving depicting a mammoth, Krahuletz-Museum]]\nThe woolly mammoth is the third-most depicted animal in ice-age art, after horses and bison, and these images were produced between 35,000 and 11,500 years ago. Today, more than 500 depictions of woolly mammoths are known, in media ranging from cave paintings and engravings on the walls of 46 caves in Russia, France, and Spain to engravings and sculptures (termed \"[[portable art]]\") made from ivory, antler, stone and bone. Cave paintings of woolly mammoths exist in several styles and sizes. The French [[Rouffignac Cave]] has the most depictions, 159, and some of the drawings are more than {{convert|2|m|ft}} in length.

Large bones were used as foundations for the huts, tusks for the entrances, and the roofs were probably skins held in place by bones or tusks. Some huts had floors that extended {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} below ground. Some huts included fireplaces, which used bones as fuel, probably because wood was scarce. Some of the bones used for materials may have come from mammoths killed by humans, but the state of the bones, and the fact that bones used to build a single dwelling varied by several thousands of years in age, suggests that they were collected remains of long-dead animals. Woolly mammoth bones were also made into various tools, furniture, and musical instruments. Large bones, such as shoulder blades, were also used to cover dead human bodies during burial.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;128\u2013132</ref>\n[[File:Venus of Brassempouy.jpg|thumb|The [[Venus of Brassempouy]], made from woolly mammoth ivory, [[National Archaeological Museum, France]]]]\nWoolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects.

Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a [[boomerang]], are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiseled, and split into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps. Few specimens show direct, unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans.

Black points are records of mammoths, black lines are the northern limit of humans]]\nMost woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early [[Holocene]], alongside most of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the [[Quaternary extinction event]], which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the [[Chaunsky District|Kyttyk Peninsula]] of Siberia 9,650 years ago.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = A.

Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue. Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed \"[[elephants' graveyard]]s\", as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found;  these are thought to be the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years, and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams. Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Natural traps, such as [[kettle holes]], [[sink holes]], and mud, have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 45 75\"/>\n\nApart from frozen remains, the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a [[petroleum seep]] in [[Starunia]], Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of [[Siberia]] and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the [[Arctic Circle]], in permafrost. Soft tissue apparently was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This \"[[natural mummification]]\" required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt, mud, and icy water, which then froze.<ref name=\"Lister, 2007. pp. 50\u201353\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;50\u201353</ref>\n\nThe presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure is likely.

One of its shoulder blades was broken, which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse. It may have died of [[asphyxiation]], as indicated by its erect penis.

In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed \"Effie\", which was found in 1948.

The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today, it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as \"white gold\". Local dealers estimate that  10 million mammoths are still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 [[Lausanne]] Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the [[Schreger lines]] are coarser in texture.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;137\u2013139</ref> In the 21st century, [[global warming]] has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it.<ref name=\"Larmer2015\">{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|title=Mammoth Tusk Hunters|website=nationalgeographic.com|date=April 2013|last=Larmer|first=B.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402004219/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|archivedate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:La fuite devant le mammouth.jpg|upright|thumb|''La fuite devant le mammouth'', [[Paul Jamin]], 1885]]\nStories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted, especially that of the \"Berezovka mammoth\", but most of these are considered dubious.

Cuthbert's training as a lawyer eventually allowed both artists to receive approval from their firms for release, with a slight compromise, the cassettes had to include download codes. The press release for the cassette and tour were revealing of the internal frictions including quotes from their management firms criticising the release. \n<ref name=\"thedwarf.com.au\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.4zzzfm.org.au/sites/default/files/music_package/audio/27_sept_2013_edward_guglielmino_unnecessary_knowledge.mp3|title=4ZZZ|website=www.4zzzfm.org.au}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thedwarf.com.au/gig/edward-guglielmino-richard-cuthbert-mona|title=Edward Guglielmino & Richard Cuthbert - MONA, BERRIEDALE :: The Dwarf|website=thedwarf.com.au|accessdate=2015-10-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Current ===\n\nGuglielmino continues to play solo shows and occasionally with [[Shem Allen]] and various drummers.

He first appeared in the 1992 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' as the main [[antagonist]] and final [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. His name is a [[portmanteau]] of Mario's name and the Japanese word ''warui'' (\u60aa\u3044), meaning \"bad\". Wario was designed by Hiroji Kiyotake, and is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who voices many other characters in the series, such as [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], and [[Waluigi]].\n\nWario has become the [[protagonist]] and [[antihero]] of the [[Wario (franchise)#Wario Land series|''Wario Land'']] and ''[[WarioWare]]'' series, spanning handheld and [[Video game console|console]] markets. In addition to appearances in [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the ''Mario'' series, he appears in cameos for ''[[Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', ''[[Densetsu no Stafy 3]]'' and ''[[Pilotwings 64]]''. He has also been featured in other media such as the ''[[Super Mario Adventures]]'' graphic novel. The character has received a largely positive critical reception.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Wario emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|One would expect the emblem on Wario's hat to follow this design, but in most appearances the letter W extends outside of the white circle.|alt=A white circle with a blue \"W\" inside it is seen over a yellow background.]]\nA possible inspiration for Wario first appeared in the 1985 game ''[[Wrecking Crew (video game)|Wrecking Crew]]'' in the character of Spike, a construction foreman.<ref name=\"kombo1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=10570 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603115614/http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=10570 |archivedate=June 3, 2008 |title=The History of Wario: Part 1|first=David|last=Oxford|publisher=Kombo |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2010}}</ref> Although he bears a slight resemblance to Spike, Wario did not debut until 1992.

He also wears a plumber outfit with a yellow and purple color scheme, which is a short-sleeved yellow shirt and purple overalls along with a blue W on his hat.

The ''WarioWare'' series prominently uses bombs as a visual motif to represent the time limit.\n\nIn video games in which Wario makes a cameo appearance, he is often portrayed as a villain.
