The aircraft is operated by the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) and [[People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force]] (PLANAF) of China (PRC). Like the Chinese [[Type 56|Norinco Type 56]] which was based off of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Ak-47]], the J-11 is a licensed Chinese version of a Soviet design. In this case, the J-11 was derived from the Soviet [[Sukhoi Su-27]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Proposed J-11===\nIn the 1970s, [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation|Shenyang Aircraft Factory]] proposed a new designed [[light fighter]] powered by the British [[Rolls-Royce Spey#Variants and applications|Rolls-Royce Spey 512 engine]], with better maneuverability than [[MiG-19]] then in service and better climb rate than MiG-21. Known as the J-11, the project was abandoned due to difficulties in obtaining the engines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china-defense.com/aviation/chinese_fighter_development/chinese_fighter_development-3.html|title=Chinese Fighter Development|publisher=China-defence.com|accessdate=2007-01-16|last=Collins|first=Jack|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116173153/http://www.china-defense.com/aviation/chinese_fighter_development/chinese_fighter_development-3.html|archivedate=2007-01-16|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Modern J-11===\nThe J-11 was finally born in 1998 as a Chinese version of the Soviet-built [[Sukhoi Su-27]]SK air superiority fighter designed by Soviet engineer [[Mikhail Simonov]] following China's success in securing a $US2.5 billion production agreement which licensed China to build 200 Su-27SK aircraft using Russian-supplied kits. Under the terms of the agreement, these aircraft would be outfitted with Russian [[avionics]], radars and engines. However, in 2004, Russian media reported that Shenyang co-production of the basic J-11 was halted after around 100 examples were built.

Specifically, to replace the Russian-made NIIP N001 radar with a Chinese-made fire control radar based on the Type 147X/KLJ-X family, the AL-31F engine with WS-10A, and Russian R-77 AAM's with Chinese-made [[PL-9]] and [[PL-12]] AAM's.  One J-11 was photographed with an AL-31F and a WS-10A engine installed for testing in 2002.  However, it was not until 2007 when the Chinese government finally revealed information on the domestic J-11: the J-11 used to test WS-10 was designated as J-11WS, and it was when state television station [[CCTV-7]] aired J-11B footages in mid-2007 when the existence of J-11 with domestic components was finally confirmed officially.\n\nSerial manufacturing of the WS-10 and integration with the J-11, proved to be more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the ''Washington Times'' suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402788_2.html | title= Military strength eludes China, which looks overseas for arms | first= John | last= Pomfret | newspaper= Washington Post | date= 25 December 2010 | access-date= 3 September 2017 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231075350/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402788_2.html | archive-date= 31 December 2016 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation|Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company]] employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures.

It is currently manufactured by the [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation]].  The aircraft is operated by the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) and [[People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force]] (PLANAF) of China (PRC).\n\n==Development==\n\n===Proposed J-11===\nIn the 1970s, [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation|Shenyang Aircraft Factory]] proposed a new designed [[light fighter]] powered by the British [[Rolls-Royce Spey#Variants and applications|Rolls-Royce Spey 512 engine]], with better maneuverability than [[MiG-19]] then in service and better climb rate than MiG-21.

Under the terms of the agreement, these aircraft would be outfitted with Russian [[avionics]], radars and engines. However, in 2004, Russian media reported that Shenyang co-production of the basic J-11 was halted after around 100 examples were built. The PLAAF later revealed a mock-up of an upgraded multi-role version of the J-11 in mid-2002. The indigenous J-11B variant incorporates various Chinese material modifications and upgrades to the airframe with improved manufacturing methods in addition to the inclusion of domestic Chinese technologies such as radar, avionics suites and [[weapon]]ry,<ref name=\"rian_j-11\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-04-20/russian-arms-copycat-china.html?fullstory |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630161930/http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-04-20/russian-arms-copycat-china.html?fullstory |url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-30 |title=Chinese version of Russian jet endangers bilateral relations |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}</ref><ref name=\"globalsec_j11\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/j-11.htm |title=Chinese Aircraft \u2013 J-11 (Sukhoi Su-27) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |access-date=2010-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218105426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/j-11.htm |archive-date=2010-02-18 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"sipri_j11copy\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjRRVy6JYW4C&pg=PA309&dq=J-11B+copy|title=SIPRI Yearbook 2009:Armaments, Disarmament, and International Security|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|isbn=978-0-19-956606-8|date=2009-09-15}}</ref> including anti-ship and [[PL-12]] air-to-air missiles presumably for the role of a maritime strike aircraft.

Fomin reported that Russia handed China the licences to manufacture the aircraft and its components, including an agreement on the production of intellectual property rights. Details of intellectual property rights, however have not been disclosed, fuelling speculation about a \"secret\" contract or parts of the original contract.

However, Russian media reports also indicate that China still intends to upgrade the current J-11 fleet's engines with either [[NPO Saturn|Saturn-Lyulka]] or [[Salyut]] powerplants. Engines under consideration include the [[Saturn AL-31#117S|Saturn AL-31-117S]] (a development of the [[Lyulka AL-31]]F planned for the Russo-Indian [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKIs]]), and the Salyut AL-31F-M1, an improved variant of the AL-31F engine.<ref name=\"sinodefence-3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/fighter/su27modernisation.asp|title=Su-27 Modernisation Programme|publisher=Sinodefence|accessdate=2007-01-16|date=2006-11-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070111140507/http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/fighter/su27modernisation.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Russian media reported that [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation]] was looking into replacing Russian-made J-11/Su-27SK components with domestic, Chinese-made parts.  Specifically, to replace the Russian-made NIIP N001 radar with a Chinese-made fire control radar based on the Type 147X/KLJ-X family, the AL-31F engine with WS-10A, and Russian R-77 AAM's with Chinese-made [[PL-9]] and [[PL-12]] AAM's.  One J-11 was photographed with an AL-31F and a WS-10A engine installed for testing in 2002.  However, it was not until 2007 when the Chinese government finally revealed information on the domestic J-11: the J-11 used to test WS-10 was designated as J-11WS, and it was when state television station [[CCTV-7]] aired J-11B footages in mid-2007 when the existence of J-11 with domestic components was finally confirmed officially.\n\nSerial manufacturing of the WS-10 and integration with the J-11, proved to be more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the ''Washington Times'' suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402788_2.html | title= Military strength eludes China, which looks overseas for arms | first= John | last= Pomfret | newspaper= Washington Post | date= 25 December 2010 | access-date= 3 September 2017 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231075350/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402788_2.html | archive-date= 31 December 2016 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, [[Shenyang Aircraft Corporation|Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company]] employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures.

As part of the tourism \"industry\", wealthy sportfishermen seeking [[Atlantic salmon]] flock to the scenic Restigouche Valley every summer.  The region sees extensive annual snowfall.  Alpine and Nordic ski facilities at [[Sugarloaf Provincial Park]] provide winter recreation opportunities for both visitors and local residents.\n\nCampbellton is also a retail and service centre for Restigouche County.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sir Archibald Campbell.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|[[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir Archibald Campbell]], the Lieutenant-Governor after whom Campbellton was named]]\nThe area around the site of the present city was settled by [[French people|French]] people circa 1700 with a trading post based upon fishing and [[fur trading]] with the [[Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation|Mi'gmaq]]. More settlers arrived here when [[Ile St. Jean]] was lost to the French as the result of the capitulation of [[Louisbourg]] in 1758.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lockerby |first=Earle |title=The Deportation of the Acadians from Ile St.-Jean, 1758 |journal=Acadiensis |volume=XXVII |issue=2 |pages=45\u201394 |date=Spring 1998 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10844/11665}}, para 47</ref> The area has had numerous names over the centuries: originally called Wisiamkik (muddy spot) by the [[Mi'kmaq]] who inhabited the region, it was then named Pointe-des-Sauvages by the French in 1700 and subsequently Pointe-Rochelle, Cavenik's Point, Kavanagh's Point, Quiton's Point and Martin's Point, before settling in 1833 with its current name in honour of Lieutenant-Governor Sir [[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Archibald Campbell]].<ref name=\"Geographical Names of New Brunswick\">{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Alan|title=Geographical Names of New Brunswick|year=1975|publisher=\u00c9nergie, Mines et Ressources Canada|location=Ottawa, Canada|pages=69}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Restigouche===\n\nIt was here that the [[Battle of the Restigouche]], the final naval battle between the English and French for the possession of North America during the [[Seven Years' War]], was waged in 1760.  It marked a turning point for the settlement.\nRobert Ferguson and the development of Campbellton and Atholville\nowed their development to the enterprising immigrants from Scotland. In 1769, only nine years after the Battle of Restigouche, Scotsman Hugh Baillie and a partner set up a fur and salted salmon business on the site that would become Campbellton. The business was sold to London merchant John Shoolbred, who in 1773 established the first British settlement on the Restigouche. His agent, William Smith, brought over eight Scottish fishermen from Aberdeen, Scotland, to work for him. Two of these fishermen were John Duncan and Robert Adams, who brought their families with them as well. These two fishermen devoted themselves to the salmon fishing industry at Old Church Point, today Atholville. In 1794, a Scotsman from Perth named Alexander Ferguson settled in Martin's Point (Campbellton), where his brother Robert joined him two years later.\n\n[[Image:Campbellton CNR.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Old Intercolonial Railway Station in Campbellton]]\n\n===From settlement to town===\n\nConsidered the founder of Restigouche County, Robert Ferguson established his control over the development of northern New Brunswick during the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ferguson_robert_8E.html |title=Ferguson, Robert |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1803, Ferguson inherited his brother's business and quickly became the largest merchant and exporter of fish in Restigouche. Until the 1840s, he shipped between 1,200 and 1,400 barrels of salted salmon per year. He became the most important landowner in the region. He also operated a flour mill and a sawmill and exported hewn wood. He even constructed his own boats in the village that now bears the name of [[Atholville]]. In 1812, he built an impressive residence there that he named Athol House in memory of [[Atholl|his native region of Scotland]].\n\nIn 1875, the advent of the intercolonial railway, and permanent railway station in 1876, had a strong impact on Campbellton. Its population increased rapidly, reaching 1,800 in 1891,<ref name=\"campbellton.org\">{{cite web |title=Visitors Guide: Historical Evolution of the Settlement|url=http://www.campbellton.org/camp2/Historyofthecity.asp |publisher=City of Campbellton |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}\n</ref> and development of the settlement shifted westward. In 1889, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[town]], and in the late 1880s, an [[hospital|H\u00f4tel Dieu]] was founded by the [[Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph]], an order that established hospitals and schools in many towns in Canada.\n\n===The Great Fire===\n\nOn 11 July 1910, a disastrous fire sparked by a [[sawmill]] on the waterfront destroyed a large portion of the town. The fire was spread throughout the town by flaming shingles. Prior to the fire its population was approaching 4,000 citizens and help came from near and far to provide food and supplies in order to come to their aid. Most of the people had to live in tents while plans to rebuild were being prepared. Campbellton was subsequently rebuilt. In the months and years following the fire, many of the new (now historic) buildings were constructed of brick as Water Street had been designated a \"Fire District\" where all new buildings had to be built with fireproof exterior walls.\n\n===Growth of the City===\n\nFollowing the fire, the railway station was moved to Roseberry St. and helped to define Campbellton in its early years. The town was bidding to become the leading commercial center in the North Shore and had three banks, five churches, two schools, 6 hotels and a hospital by the 1920s. At this time Campbellton was seeing upwards of 16 trains a day at the Central Station. In 1928, a pulp mill was built in nearby Atholville which continued to propel the population growth already being experienced. Campbellton was experiencing strong growth as the population grew at a steady rate: 3,817 in 1911, 5,570 in 1921, 6,505 in 1931, 6,714 in 1941, 9,257 in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberbart.tripod.com/cton3.htm |title=Page Three of Campbellton's history and pictures |first=Irene |last=Doyle |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1951, Campbellton opened its new arena, the Memorial Gardens, with an exhibition game featuring the [[Montreal Canadiens]].\n\nIn 1958, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[City]] and its population was approaching 13,000. At this time the construction of the [[J.C. Van Horne Bridge|J.C. Van Horne Interprovincial bridge]] commenced which was designed to facilitate travel between Quebec and Northern [[New Brunswick]]. The bridge was completed in 1961 and allowed the cross-river town of [[Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Quebec|Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix]] to fully integrate itself commercially with the City of Campbellton. The Salmon Festival was inaugurated in 1967 and has been a popular annual week-long event which is enjoyed by tourists and residents alike. Campbellton's city limits were expanded in 1979 when the Richardsville area became part of the City.\n\n===Esplanade Restigouche===\n\nIn 2009, Mayor [[Bruce MacIntosh]] and Council made significant progress towards restoring the tourism industry in the area and in improving the City's waterfront. They announced that the long-awaited \"Esplanade Restigouche\" development would finally move forward. This is a three phased project, that began in 2011, that will significantly upgrade the already picturesque waterfront and further cement Campbellton's place as a tourist destination.  \nThe Restigouche River Experience Center has been constructed with a Restigouche River Museum and an 86 site RV Park which will help Campbellton in becoming the hub for regional experiential tourism.   In 2016, the newly elected mayor, Stephanie Anglehart-Paulin and Council have decided to move towards developing the Atlantic Culinary Institute in conjunction with the CCNB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://virtuel.laviron.canoe.ca/doc/hebdo_l-aviron/Aviron_20090501OPT/2009042801/3.html%232 |title=Esplanade Restigouche: Un projet pour developper les berges |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721230052/http://virtuel.laviron.canoe.ca/doc/hebdo_l-aviron/Aviron_20090501OPT/2009042801/3.html%232 |archivedate=July 21, 2012|language=French |website=laviron.canoe.ca|date=June 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Fire Ship===\n\nThe history of the City of Campbellton is not complete without mentioning the infamous Phantom Ship known as \"[[Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs]]\".<ref name=\"campbellton.org\"/> Stories of its appearance include seeing a burning sailing vessel, sometimes a vessel with all its sails set scudding along the water or sometimes a ball of fire or burning vessel on the water's surface or fading out of sight. This is not frequently seen. Some believe it is a ghost ship from the Battle of the Restigouche whereas others believe it is merely caused by heat waves, reflections or hallucinations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The phantom ship of Chaleur Bay |url=http://new-brunswick.net/new-brunswick/ghoststory/ghost7.html |first=Gail |last=MacMillan |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCampbellton is 20&nbsp;km upstream (west) from the mouth of the Bay des Chaleurs [[Dalhousie, New Brunswick|Dalhousie]] and approximately 100&nbsp;km northwest of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]].  The city is approximately 160&nbsp;km northeast of [[Saint-L\u00e9onard, New Brunswick|St. Leonard]] in the [[St. John River (Bay of Fundy)|St. John River]] valley and approximately the same distance from [[Mont-Joli]], Quebec in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley.

The First President of the society was also The First Mayor of Campbellton [[John McAlister]]. To display the history of the city and the battle of the Restigouche, Riverside Park is home to two cannons used in the battle; one with three fleurs-de-lys on the barrel and the other with what appears to be stylized anchors. These are French naval guns from a five gun battery erected during the battle at Battery Point on the Quebec side of the river. When the Busteed family received a land grant at Battery Point, circa 1790, they found at least three cannons at the old battery site. One cannon was built into the fireplace of their home, called Bordeaux House, and two others were given to relatives across the river at Athol House in Atholville. For many years the two cannons outside Athol House were fired on ceremonial occasions. After Athol House burned, the guns lay on the riverbank until donated to the City of Campbellton in 1898. The park also features two monuments donated to the City displaying the names of local soldiers who died in battle during World War I and World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |title=Restigouche County  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155528/https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 |website=New Brunswick Military Heritage Project}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Restigouche Gallery]] is local gallery and functions as a centre in the cultural program of the region.

|url=http://archives.gnb.ca/Exhibits/Communities/Details.aspx?culture=en-CA&community=574/ |website=New Brunswick Provincial Archives |title=Campbellton}}</ref>\n\nSituated on the south bank of the [[Restigouche River]] opposite [[Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Quebec|Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix]], [[Quebec]], Campbellton was officially incorporated in 1889 and achieved city status in 1958.\n\n[[Forestry]] and tourism are major industries in the regional economy, while a [[pulp mill]] in nearby [[Atholville, New Brunswick|Atholville]] is the largest single employer in the area.  As part of the tourism \"industry\", wealthy sportfishermen seeking [[Atlantic salmon]] flock to the scenic Restigouche Valley every summer.  The region sees extensive annual snowfall.  Alpine and Nordic ski facilities at [[Sugarloaf Provincial Park]] provide winter recreation opportunities for both visitors and local residents.\n\nCampbellton is also a retail and service centre for Restigouche County.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sir Archibald Campbell.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|[[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir Archibald Campbell]], the Lieutenant-Governor after whom Campbellton was named]]\nThe area around the site of the present city was settled by [[French people|French]] people circa 1700 with a trading post based upon fishing and [[fur trading]] with the [[Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation|Mi'gmaq]]. More settlers arrived here when [[Ile St. Jean]] was lost to the French as the result of the capitulation of [[Louisbourg]] in 1758.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lockerby |first=Earle |title=The Deportation of the Acadians from Ile St.-Jean, 1758 |journal=Acadiensis |volume=XXVII |issue=2 |pages=45\u201394 |date=Spring 1998 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10844/11665}}, para 47</ref> The area has had numerous names over the centuries: originally called Wisiamkik (muddy spot) by the [[Mi'kmaq]] who inhabited the region, it was then named Pointe-des-Sauvages by the French in 1700 and subsequently Pointe-Rochelle, Cavenik's Point, Kavanagh's Point, Quiton's Point and Martin's Point, before settling in 1833 with its current name in honour of Lieutenant-Governor Sir [[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Archibald Campbell]].<ref name=\"Geographical Names of New Brunswick\">{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Alan|title=Geographical Names of New Brunswick|year=1975|publisher=\u00c9nergie, Mines et Ressources Canada|location=Ottawa, Canada|pages=69}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Restigouche===\n\nIt was here that the [[Battle of the Restigouche]], the final naval battle between the English and French for the possession of North America during the [[Seven Years' War]], was waged in 1760.  It marked a turning point for the settlement.\nRobert Ferguson and the development of Campbellton and Atholville\nowed their development to the enterprising immigrants from Scotland. In 1769, only nine years after the Battle of Restigouche, Scotsman Hugh Baillie and a partner set up a fur and salted salmon business on the site that would become Campbellton. The business was sold to London merchant John Shoolbred, who in 1773 established the first British settlement on the Restigouche. His agent, William Smith, brought over eight Scottish fishermen from Aberdeen, Scotland, to work for him. Two of these fishermen were John Duncan and Robert Adams, who brought their families with them as well. These two fishermen devoted themselves to the salmon fishing industry at Old Church Point, today Atholville. In 1794, a Scotsman from Perth named Alexander Ferguson settled in Martin's Point (Campbellton), where his brother Robert joined him two years later.\n\n[[Image:Campbellton CNR.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Old Intercolonial Railway Station in Campbellton]]\n\n===From settlement to town===\n\nConsidered the founder of Restigouche County, Robert Ferguson established his control over the development of northern New Brunswick during the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ferguson_robert_8E.html |title=Ferguson, Robert |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1803, Ferguson inherited his brother's business and quickly became the largest merchant and exporter of fish in Restigouche. Until the 1840s, he shipped between 1,200 and 1,400 barrels of salted salmon per year. He became the most important landowner in the region. He also operated a flour mill and a sawmill and exported hewn wood. He even constructed his own boats in the village that now bears the name of [[Atholville]]. In 1812, he built an impressive residence there that he named Athol House in memory of [[Atholl|his native region of Scotland]].\n\nIn 1875, the advent of the intercolonial railway, and permanent railway station in 1876, had a strong impact on Campbellton. Its population increased rapidly, reaching 1,800 in 1891,<ref name=\"campbellton.org\">{{cite web |title=Visitors Guide: Historical Evolution of the Settlement|url=http://www.campbellton.org/camp2/Historyofthecity.asp |publisher=City of Campbellton |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}\n</ref> and development of the settlement shifted westward. In 1889, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[town]], and in the late 1880s, an [[hospital|H\u00f4tel Dieu]] was founded by the [[Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph]], an order that established hospitals and schools in many towns in Canada.\n\n===The Great Fire===\n\nOn 11 July 1910, a disastrous fire sparked by a [[sawmill]] on the waterfront destroyed a large portion of the town. The fire was spread throughout the town by flaming shingles. Prior to the fire its population was approaching 4,000 citizens and help came from near and far to provide food and supplies in order to come to their aid. Most of the people had to live in tents while plans to rebuild were being prepared. Campbellton was subsequently rebuilt. In the months and years following the fire, many of the new (now historic) buildings were constructed of brick as Water Street had been designated a \"Fire District\" where all new buildings had to be built with fireproof exterior walls.\n\n===Growth of the City===\n\nFollowing the fire, the railway station was moved to Roseberry St. and helped to define Campbellton in its early years. The town was bidding to become the leading commercial center in the North Shore and had three banks, five churches, two schools, 6 hotels and a hospital by the 1920s. At this time Campbellton was seeing upwards of 16 trains a day at the Central Station. In 1928, a pulp mill was built in nearby Atholville which continued to propel the population growth already being experienced. Campbellton was experiencing strong growth as the population grew at a steady rate: 3,817 in 1911, 5,570 in 1921, 6,505 in 1931, 6,714 in 1941, 9,257 in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberbart.tripod.com/cton3.htm |title=Page Three of Campbellton's history and pictures |first=Irene |last=Doyle |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1951, Campbellton opened its new arena, the Memorial Gardens, with an exhibition game featuring the [[Montreal Canadiens]].\n\nIn 1958, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[City]] and its population was approaching 13,000. At this time the construction of the [[J.C. Van Horne Bridge|J.C. Van Horne Interprovincial bridge]] commenced which was designed to facilitate travel between Quebec and Northern [[New Brunswick]]. The bridge was completed in 1961 and allowed the cross-river town of [[Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Quebec|Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix]] to fully integrate itself commercially with the City of Campbellton. The Salmon Festival was inaugurated in 1967 and has been a popular annual week-long event which is enjoyed by tourists and residents alike. Campbellton's city limits were expanded in 1979 when the Richardsville area became part of the City.\n\n===Esplanade Restigouche===\n\nIn 2009, Mayor [[Bruce MacIntosh]] and Council made significant progress towards restoring the tourism industry in the area and in improving the City's waterfront. They announced that the long-awaited \"Esplanade Restigouche\" development would finally move forward. This is a three phased project, that began in 2011, that will significantly upgrade the already picturesque waterfront and further cement Campbellton's place as a tourist destination.  \nThe Restigouche River Experience Center has been constructed with a Restigouche River Museum and an 86 site RV Park which will help Campbellton in becoming the hub for regional experiential tourism.   In 2016, the newly elected mayor, Stephanie Anglehart-Paulin and Council have decided to move towards developing the Atlantic Culinary Institute in conjunction with the CCNB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://virtuel.laviron.canoe.ca/doc/hebdo_l-aviron/Aviron_20090501OPT/2009042801/3.html%232 |title=Esplanade Restigouche: Un projet pour developper les berges |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721230052/http://virtuel.laviron.canoe.ca/doc/hebdo_l-aviron/Aviron_20090501OPT/2009042801/3.html%232 |archivedate=July 21, 2012|language=French |website=laviron.canoe.ca|date=June 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Fire Ship===\n\nThe history of the City of Campbellton is not complete without mentioning the infamous Phantom Ship known as \"[[Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs]]\".<ref name=\"campbellton.org\"/> Stories of its appearance include seeing a burning sailing vessel, sometimes a vessel with all its sails set scudding along the water or sometimes a ball of fire or burning vessel on the water's surface or fading out of sight. This is not frequently seen. Some believe it is a ghost ship from the Battle of the Restigouche whereas others believe it is merely caused by heat waves, reflections or hallucinations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The phantom ship of Chaleur Bay |url=http://new-brunswick.net/new-brunswick/ghoststory/ghost7.html |first=Gail |last=MacMillan |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCampbellton is 20&nbsp;km upstream (west) from the mouth of the Bay des Chaleurs [[Dalhousie, New Brunswick|Dalhousie]] and approximately 100&nbsp;km northwest of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]].  The city is approximately 160&nbsp;km northeast of [[Saint-L\u00e9onard, New Brunswick|St. Leonard]] in the [[St. John River (Bay of Fundy)|St. John River]] valley and approximately the same distance from [[Mont-Joli]], Quebec in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley. Campbellton was settled by the Scottish including surrounding area like Balmoral, Glencoe, and Glenlevit.\n\n{{wide image|Campbellton - Skyline Full.jpg|1800px|Campbellton Skyline - Eastern portion of the downtown area from the City Center to the Memorial Civic Center.

The First President of the society was also The First Mayor of Campbellton [[John McAlister]]. To display the history of the city and the battle of the Restigouche, Riverside Park is home to two cannons used in the battle; one with three fleurs-de-lys on the barrel and the other with what appears to be stylized anchors. These are French naval guns from a five gun battery erected during the battle at Battery Point on the Quebec side of the river. When the Busteed family received a land grant at Battery Point, circa 1790, they found at least three cannons at the old battery site. One cannon was built into the fireplace of their home, called Bordeaux House, and two others were given to relatives across the river at Athol House in Atholville. For many years the two cannons outside Athol House were fired on ceremonial occasions. After Athol House burned, the guns lay on the riverbank until donated to the City of Campbellton in 1898. The park also features two monuments donated to the City displaying the names of local soldiers who died in battle during World War I and World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |title=Restigouche County  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155528/https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 |website=New Brunswick Military Heritage Project}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Restigouche Gallery]] is local gallery and functions as a centre in the cultural program of the region.
