With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison so that he can get the monkey he owes Crank. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys. Due to the Danger Force have not yet controlled their powers and Mika's sonic scream manifesting, they mess up in the first battle and accidentally free the Toddler, Frankini, Goomer, the Beekeeper, Dr. Minyak, Jeff, the Time Jerker, Jack Frittleman, the Thumb Buddies, and other unnamed criminals from Swellview Prison.

Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake. Their first attempt to get their right names said is to get a toddler that Bose mistook for Toddler named Ellis back to his parents.

After passing, Shapen gets them two new students she found a bus stop due to a shortage of entries at the local gifted school. Schwoz finds a loophole in which they can get the students to leave on their own if it is miserable. The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning, Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting.

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison so that he can get the monkey he owes Crank. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys. Due to the Danger Force have not yet controlled their powers and Mika's sonic scream manifesting, they mess up in the first battle and accidentally free the Toddler, Frankini, Goomer, the Beekeeper, Dr. Minyak, Jeff, the Time Jerker, Jack Frittleman, the Thumb Buddies, and other unnamed criminals from Swellview Prison.

They want to be referred to as Volt, AWOL, Shout-Out, and Brainstorm. Schwoz states if the news uses their dumb name three times, it will stick. Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake. Their first attempt to get their right names said is to get a toddler that Bose mistook for Toddler named Ellis back to his parents. Mika and Miles go to Hip Hop Puree to meet a vlogger named Natalie Mazdah who sat on the same airplane that [[Emma Watson]] rode where they plan to get her to say the names of their superhero forms three times. When the Danger Force tries to get her to say their name, Hip Hop Pureee is visited by the Toddler and his henchmen.

After passing, Shapen gets them two new students she found a bus stop due to a shortage of entries at the local gifted school. Schwoz finds a loophole in which they can get the students to leave on their own if it is miserable. The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning, Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough sleep. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them.
