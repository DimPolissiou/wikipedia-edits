It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the initial stages of the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement.

[[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked the hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass spanning some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarandaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarandaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]]. The fate of [[Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great

The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked the hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass spanning some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarandaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarandaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]].

Festinger explained this phenomenon as part of a coping mechanism called dissonance reduction, a form of [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]. Members often dedicate themselves with renewed vigor to the group's cause after a failed prophecy, and rationalize with explanations such as a belief that their actions forestalled the disaster, or a belief in the leader when the date for disaster is postponed.\n\nSome researchers believe that the use of the term by the government and the news media can lead to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], in which actions by authorities reinforces the apocalyptic beliefs of the group, which in turn can inspire further controversial actions. Group leaders have themselves objected to comparisons between one group and another, and parallels have been drawn between the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy and the theory of a [[deviancy amplification spiral]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term \"doomsday cult\" was first used in the title of a 1966 scholarly study of a group of [[Unification Church]] members by [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]], entitled: ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''.<ref name=\"jenkins\" /><ref name=\"lofland\">{{cite book | last =Lofland | first =John |   title =Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith | publisher =[[Prentice-Hall]] | year =1966  | isbn = 978-0-8290-0095-5|doi=}}</ref> Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: \"The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes,\" and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]].<ref>[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion], [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]</ref> It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], and one of the first modern sociological studies of a [[new religious movement]].<ref>''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

Festinger explained this phenomenon as part of a coping mechanism called dissonance reduction, a form of [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]].  Members often dedicate themselves with renewed vigor to the group's cause after a failed prophecy, and rationalize with explanations such as a belief that their actions forestalled the disaster, or a belief in the leader when the date for disaster is postponed.\n\nSome researchers believe that the use of the term by the government and the news media can lead to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], in which actions by authorities reinforces the apocalyptic beliefs of the group, which in turn can inspire further controversial actions.  Group leaders have themselves objected to comparisons between one group and another, and parallels have been drawn between the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy and the theory of a [[deviancy amplification spiral]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term \"doomsday cult\" was first used in the title of a 1966 scholarly study of a group of [[Unification Church]] members by [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]], entitled: ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''.<ref name=\"jenkins\" /><ref name=\"lofland\">{{cite book | last =Lofland | first =John |   title =Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith | publisher =[[Prentice-Hall]] | year =1966  | isbn = 978-0-8290-0095-5|doi=}}</ref>  Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: \"The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes,\" and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]].<ref>[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion], [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]</ref> It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], and one of the first modern sociological studies of a [[new religious movement]].<ref>''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

Arguing that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] [[consciousness]] sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental-idealist]] philosophy.

He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children. His father was a [[milliner]]. His childhood was spent in Prost\u011bjov, where he attended the secular elementary school. Then Husserl traveled to [[Vienna]] to study at the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' there, followed next by the Staatsgymnasium in [[Olomouc]] (Ger.: Olm\u00fctz).<ref name=\"KockelmansBiographical\">Joseph J.

At Leipzig he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], one of the founders of modern psychology. Then he moved to the [[Frederick William University]] of [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) in 1878 where he continued his study of mathematics under [[Leopold Kronecker]] and the renowned [[Karl Weierstrass]]. In Berlin he found a mentor in [[Thomas Masaryk]], then a former philosophy student of [[Franz Brentano]] and later the first president of [[Czechoslovakia]]. There Husserl also attended [[Friedrich Paulsen]]'s philosophy lectures. In 1881 he left for the [[University of Vienna]] to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of [[Leo K\u00f6nigsberger]] (a former student of Weierstrass). At Vienna in 1883 he obtained his PhD with the work ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Variationsrechnung'' (''Contributions to the [[Calculus of variations|Calculus of Variations]]'').<ref name=\"KockelmansBiographical\"/>\n\nEvidently as a result of his becoming familiar with the [[New Testament]] during his twenties, Husserl asked to be baptized into the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1886. Husserl's father Adolf had died in 1884. [[Herbert Spiegelberg]] writes, \"While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience.\" At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral \"renewal\". Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational ''autonomy'' in all things, Husserl could also speak \"about his vocation and even about his mission under God's will to find new ways for philosophy and science,\" observes Spiegelberg.<ref>Spiegelberg, H. ''The Phenomenological Movement. A historical introduction''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. {{ISBN|9024702399}}. Vol. I, pp. 85\u201387. It was reported \"from witnesses of Husserl's last days \u2013 that Husserl had something like a deathbed conversion.\" Spiegelberg (1971) at I:85.</ref>\n\nFollowing his PhD in mathematics, Husserl returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to [[Karl Weierstrass]]. Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy. Then professor Weierstrass became very ill. Husserl became free to return to Vienna where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to [[philosophy]]. In 1884 at the [[University of Vienna]] he attended the lectures of [[Franz Brentano]] on philosophy and philosophical [[psychology]]. Brentano introduced him to the writings of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[John Stuart Mill|J. Stuart Mill]], and [[David Hume]]. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e.g., with regard to [[intentionality]].<ref>Spiegelberg, H., ''The Context of the Phenomenological Movement'' (Berlin/Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media]], 1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XVVFBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA134 p. 134].</ref> Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed [[Carl Stumpf]], a former student of Brentano, to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], seeking to obtain his [[habilitation]] which would qualify him to teach at the university level. There, under Stumpf's supervision, he wrote ''\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl'' (''On the Concept of Number'') in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik]]'' (1891).<ref>Kockelmans, \"Biographical Note\" per Edmund Husserl, 17\u201320, at 17\u201318, in his edited ''Phenomenology'' (Doubleday Anchor 1967).

In 1892 their daughter Elizabeth was born, in 1893 their son [[Gerhart Husserl|Gerhart]], and in 1894 their son Wolfgang. Elizabeth would marry in 1922, and Gerhart in 1923; Wolfgang, however, became a casualty of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" /> Gerhart would become a philosopher of law, contributing to the subject of [[comparative law]], teaching in the United States and after the war in [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gerhart Husserl; by H.

In 1891 he published his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen]]'' which, drawing on his prior studies in mathematics and philosophy, proposed a psychological context as the basis of mathematics. It drew the adverse notice of [[Gottlob Frege]], who criticized its [[psychologism]].<ref>Cf., \"Illustrative extracts from Frege's Review of Husserl's ''Philosophie der Arithmetik''\", translated by P.T.Geach, at 79\u201385, in Peter Geach and Max Black, editors, ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1977).</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ Edmund Husserl].

Ric\u0153ur traces Husserl's development from the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' to his later ''Ideen'' (1913), as leading from the psychological to the transcendental, regarding the intuition of essences (which the methodology of the [[phenomenological reduction]] allows). The book ''Husserl'' contains translations of Ric\u0153ur's essays of 1949\u20131967.</ref> This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey. Two years later in Italy he paid a visit to Franz Brentano his inspiring old teacher and to [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] the mathematician. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] were also now influencing his thought. In 1910 he became joint editor of the journal ''Logos''. During this period Husserl had delivered lectures on ''internal time consciousness'', which several decades later his former student Heidegger edited for publication.<ref>Husserl, ''Vorlesungen zur Ph\u00e4nomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins'' (1928), translated as ''The Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness'' (Indiana University 1964).</ref>\n\nIn 1912 at Freiburg the journal ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung'' (\"Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research\") was founded by Husserl and his school, and which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930. His important work ''Ideen''<ref>Husserl, ''Ideen au einer reinen Ph\u00e4nomenologie und ph\u00e4nomenologischen Philosophie'' (1913), translated as ''Ideas. General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (New York: Macmillan 1931; reprint Collier), with \"Author's Preface to the English Edition\" at 5\u201322. Therein, Husserl in 1931 refers to \"Transcendental Subjectivity\" being \"a new field of experience\" opened as a result of practicing [[phenomenological reduction]], and giving rise to an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' science not empirically based but somewhat similar to mathematics. By such practice the individual becomes the \"transcendental Ego\", although Husserl acknowledges the problem of [[solipsism]]. Later he emphasizes \"the necessary stressing of the difference between transcendental and psychological subjectivity, the repeated declaration that transcendental phenomenology is not in any sense psychology... \" but rather (in contrast to naturalistic psychology) by the phenomenological reduction \"the life of the soul is made intelligible in its most intimate and originally instuitional essence\" and whereby \"objects of the most varied grades right up to the level of the objective world are there for the Ego... .\" ''Ibid.'' at 5\u20137, 11\u201312, 18.</ref> was published in its first issue.

On 8 March 1916, on the battlefield of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], Wolfgang was killed in action. The next year his other son [[Gerhart Husserl]] was wounded in the war but survived.

The mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]] began corresponding with him in 1918. Husserl gave four lectures on Phenomenological method at [[University College, London]] in 1922. The [[University of Berlin]] in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. In 1926 Heidegger dedicated his book ''Sein und Zeit'' (''[[Being and Time]]'') to him \"in grateful respect and friendship.\"<ref>In the 1962 translation ''Being and Time'' by Macquarrie and Robinson, Heidegger states: \"Dedicated to ''Edmund Husserl'' in friendship and admiration.

A ''[[Festschrift]]'' to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 April 1929.\n\nDespite retirement, Husserl gave several notable lectures. The first, at Paris in 1929,<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Pariser Vortr\u00e4ge'' [1929], translated as ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967), by Peter Koestenbaum, with an \"Introductory Essay\" at ix\u2013lxxvii.</ref> led to ''[[Cartesian Meditations|M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes]]'' (Paris 1931).<ref>This work was published first in French.

A German edition ''Cartesianische Meditationen'' (which Husserl had reworked) came out in 1950.</ref> Husserl here reviews the ''epoch\u00e9'' or transcendental reduction, presented earlier in his pivotal ''Ideen'' (1913), in terms of a further reduction of experience to what he calls a 'sphere of ownness.' From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts in order to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental [[Human ego|ego]] finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad.  This '[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental [[intersubjectivity]], which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings.  There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject.  One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the ''Cartesian Meditations'' itself becomes transcendent. It remains, however, alone (unconnected). Only the ego's grasp \"by analogy\" of the Other (e.g., by conjectural reciprocity) allows the possibility for an 'objective' intersubjectivity, and hence for community.<ref>Ricoeur, Paul (1967).

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> [[Gerhard Ritter]] was the only Freiburg faculty member to attend the funeral, as an anti-Nazi protest.\n\n===Heidegger and the Nazi era===\nHusserl was incorrectly rumoured to have been denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation of April 1933.<ref>Hugo Ott, ''Martin Heidegger, Unterwegs zu seiner Biographie''. Campus Verlag p.168, Walter Biemel \"Erinnerungsfragmente\" in Erinnerung an Martin Heidegger Neske 1977 S.22</ref> However, among other disabilities Husserl was unable to publish his works in Nazi Germany; cf. above footnote to ''Die Krisis'' (1936). It was also rumoured that his former pupil [[Martin Heidegger]] informed Husserl that he was discharged, but it was actually the previous rector.<ref>R\u00fcdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253\u20138.</ref>\nApparently Husserl and Heidegger had moved apart during the 1920s, which became clearer after 1928 when Husserl retired and Heidegger succeeded to his university chair. In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed:  e.g., Heidegger substituted ''Dasein'' [\"Being-there\"] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl. Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of [[Max Scheler]], were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various ''Kant Societies'' in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled ''Ph\u00e4nomenologie und Anthropologie''.<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971).

This was not due to a negation of the relationship between the two philosophers, however, but rather was the result of a suggested censorship by Heidegger's publisher who feared that the book might otherwise be banned by the Nazi regime.<ref name = \"mohzpp\">\"Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten\". ''Der Spiegel'', 31 May 1967.</ref> The dedication can still be found in a footnote on page 38, thanking Husserl for his guidance and generosity. Husserl, of course, had died three years earlier. In post-war editions of ''Sein und Zeit'' the dedication to Husserl is restored. The complex, troubled, and sundered philosophical relationship between Husserl and Heidegger has been widely discussed.<ref name=b1/><ref>Husserl is mentioned by [[Bernard Stiegler]] in the 2004 film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]''.</ref>\n\nOn 4 May 1933, Professor Edmund Husserl addressed the recent regime change in Germany and its consequences:<blockquote>The future alone will judge which was the true Germany in 1933, and who were the true Germans\u2014those who subscribe to the more or less materialistic-mythical racial prejudices of the day, or those Germans pure in heart and mind, heirs to the great Germans of the past whose tradition they revere and perpetuate.<ref>Richard Evans, ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' (Penguin 2003), p. 421.</ref></blockquote>After his death, Husserl's manuscripts, amounting to approximately 40,000 pages of \"''[[Gabelsberger shorthand|Gabelsberger]]''\" [[stenography]] and his complete research library, were in 1939 smuggled to [[Belgium]] by the Franciscan priest [[Herman Van Breda]]. There they were deposited at [[Leuven]] to form the ''Husserl-Archives'' of the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]].<ref>Cf., Peter Koestenbaum, \"Introductory Essay\" ix\u2013lxxvii, at lxxv\u2013lxxvi, in his edited Edmund Husserl, ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967). His widow Malvine Husserl was instrumental in this rescue project; she became a convert to Catholicism in 1941.</ref> Much of the material in his research manuscripts has since been published in the [[Husserliana]] critical edition series.<ref>Kockelmans, \"The Husserl-Archives\", at 20\u201321, in his edited ''Phenomenology'' (Doubleday Anchor 1967).</ref>\n\n==Development of his thought==\n\n===Several early themes===\nIn his first works Husserl tries to combine mathematics, psychology and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects.\n\nFrom Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between ''proper'' and ''improper'' presenting.<ref>Fisette, D., & Martinelli, R., eds., ''Philosophy from an Empirical Standpoint: Essays on Carl Stumpf'' ([[Leiden]]/[[Boston]]: [[Rodopi (publisher)|Brill Rodopi]], 2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1jFCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA159 p. 159].</ref>{{rp|159}} In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic, as he also calls it) one if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900\u20131901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as [[mereology]].<ref>{{citation| first=Peter | last=Simons | author-link=Peter Simons (professor) | title=Parts: A Study in Ontology | publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref>\n\nAnother important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is [[intentionality]], the notion that the main characteristic of [[consciousness]] is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of ''mental phenomena'', by which they could be distinguished from ''physical phenomena''. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the ''[[intentional object]]''). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.<ref>[[Roderick Chisholm|Chisholm, R. M.]] (1967). \"Intentionality\". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 4: 201.</ref>\n\n===The elaboration of phenomenology<!--linked from 'Michel Henry'-->===\nSome years after the 1900\u20131901 publication of his main work, the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (''Logical Investigations''), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness<ref>de Warren, N., ''Husserl and the Promise of Time: Subjectivity in Transcendental Phenomenology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDtsfIKAg4gC&pg=PA79 p. 79].</ref> and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by \"[[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called ''[[epoch\u00e9]]''. These new concepts prompted the publication of the ''Ideen'' (''Ideas'') in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the ''Logische Untersuchungen''.\n\nFrom the ''Ideen'' onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what we perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]. Husserl proposed that the world of objects\u2014and of ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects\u2014is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural standpoint\", which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them. Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \"constitute\" them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply \"external\" and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or \"type\". The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but \"bracketed\" as a way in which we regard objects{{emdash}}instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive (or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.<ref name=\"Boer1978\">{{cite book|author=Theodorus Boer|title=The Development of Husserl's Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XsudxFWboC&pg=PA121|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=31 December 1978|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-2039-2|page=121}}</ref>\n\nIn a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of [[intersubjectivity]], specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'', Meditation V). Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to scientific inquiry (and specifically to [[psychology]]) and what it means to \"bracket\" the natural attitude. ''The Crisis of the European Sciences'' is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]], emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) [[empirical]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] orientation. Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis,<ref>This assumption led Husserl to an idealistic position (which he originally had tried to overcome or avoid).

II, 1935</ref>\n\n==Husserl's thought==\n{{Further|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}\nHusserl's thought is revolutionary in several ways, most notably in the distinction between \"natural\" and \"phenomenological\" modes of understanding. In the former, sense-perception in correspondence with the material realm constitutes the known reality, and understanding is premised on the accuracy of the perception and the objective knowability of what is called the \"real world\".<ref name=\"Keen2009\">{{cite book|author=Ralph Keen|title=Exile and Restoration in Jewish Thought: An Essay In Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZc5313lR8wC&pg=PA68|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-5308-2|page=68}}</ref> Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously \"presuppositionless\" by means of what Husserl calls \"[[phenomenological reduction]]\".<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'', tr.

Drost, 'The Primacy of Perception in Husserl's Theory of Imagining,' ''PPR 1'' (1990) 569\u201382. The German ''begreifen'', cognate with English 'grip,' carries the same sense.</ref>\n\n===Meaning and object===\nFrom ''Logical Investigations'' (1900/1901) to ''Experience and Judgment'' (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]. He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object.<ref>[[Super-recursive algorithm|Burgin, M.]], ''Theory of Knowledge: Structures and Processes'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmptDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA468 p. 468].</ref> Examples of this are \"the victor in Jena\" and \"the loser in Waterloo\", or \"the equilateral triangle\" and \"the equiangular triangle\"; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: \"Aristotle\", \"Socrates\", and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called \"universal names\"; their meaning is a \"[[concept]]\" and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way we know sensible objects is called \"[[Noumenon|sensible intuition]]\".\n\nHusserl also identifies a series of \"formal words\" which are necessary to form [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] and have no sensible [[wikt:correlate#Noun|correlates]]. Examples of formal words are \"a\", \"the\", \"more than\", \"over\", \"under\", \"two\", \"group\", and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls \"formal categories\". There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-[[ontological]] categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[Plural|forms of plural]], among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]], [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], part and whole, relation, and so on. The way we know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called \"categorial intuition\".\n\nThrough sensible intuition our [[consciousness]] constitutes what Husserl calls a \"situation of affairs\" (''Sachlage''). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented to us. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, we are able to constitute a \"[[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]]\" (''Sachverhalt''). One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. We can use it as basis to say, \"''a''<''b''\" and \"''b''>''a''\", two judgments which designate the same state of affairs. For Husserl a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] has a [[proposition]] or [[judgment]] as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base.<ref>Rosado Haddock, G. E., & Ortiz Hill, C., ''Husserl or Frege?: Meaning, Objectivity, and Mathematics'' ([[Chicago]] and [[LaSalle, Illinois|LaSalle]]: [[Open Court Publishing Company|Open Court]], 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4BgqIntkK5sC&pg=PA35 p. 35].</ref>{{rp|35}}\n\n===Philosophy of logic and mathematics===\nHusserl believed that ''truth-in-itself'' has as [[ontology|ontological]] correlate ''being-in-itself'', just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates. [[Logic]] is a formal theory of [[belief|judgment]], that studies the formal ''a priori'' relations among judgments using meaning categories. Mathematics, on the other hand, is [[formal ontology]]; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why we do not deal with sensible objects in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called \"categorial abstraction.\" Through this faculty we are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.\n\nThanks to \"eidetic intuition\" (or \"essential intuition\"), we are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic intuition, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.\n\nHusserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that give us objective knowledge of pure logic. All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted [[noema]]tically) as it is constituted by consciousness needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness).\n\nHusserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it.\n* The first stratum is what Husserl called a \"morphology of meanings\" concerning ''a priori'' ways to relate judgments to make them meaningful. In this stratum we elaborate a \"pure grammar\" or a logical syntax, and he would call its rules \"laws to prevent non-sense\", which would be similar to what logic calls today \"[[formal language|formation rules]]\". Mathematics, as logic's ontological correlate, also has a similar stratum, a \"morphology of formal-ontological categories\".\n* The second stratum would be called by Husserl \"logic of consequence\" or the \"logic of non-contradiction\" which explores all possible forms of true judgments. He includes here syllogistic classic logic, propositional logic and that of predicates. This is a semantic stratum, and the rules of this stratum would be the \"laws to avoid counter-sense\" or \"laws to prevent contradiction\". They are very similar to today's logic \"[[formal language|transformation rules]]\". Mathematics also has a similar stratum which is based among others on pure theory of pluralities, and a pure theory of numbers. They provide a science of the conditions of possibility of any theory whatsoever. Husserl also talked about what he called \"logic of truth\" which consists of the formal laws of possible truth and its modalities, and precedes the third logical third stratum.\n* The third stratum is [[metalogic]]al, what he called a \"theory of all possible forms of theories.\" It explores all possible theories in an ''a priori'' fashion, rather than the possibility of theory in general. We could establish theories of possible relations between pure forms of theories, investigate these logical relations and the deductions from such general connection. The logician is free to see the extension of this deductive, theoretical sphere of pure logic.\n\nThe ontological correlate to the third stratum is the \"[[manifolds|theory of manifolds]]\". In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner. It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all. Through the posit of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the [[Apodicticity|apodeictic]] connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved.\n\nAccording to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s (both [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]), [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra|theory of extension]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, [[Sophus Lie]]'s theory of [[transformation groups]], and [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]].\n\n[[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to \"desedimentize\" mathematics and the mathematical sciences.<ref>See especially Klein's [https://books.google.cz/books?id=EkPDAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover ''Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra''] (MIT Press, 1968).</ref>\n\n==Husserl and psychologism==\n\n===Philosophy of arithmetic and Frege===\nAfter obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the [[foundations of mathematics]] from a psychological point of view. In his [[habilitation thesis]], ''On the Concept of Number'' (1886) and in his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic (book)|Philosophy of Arithmetic]]'' (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano's descriptive psychology, to define the [[natural number]]s in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and other contemporary mathematicians. Later, in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena of Pure Logic'', Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the ''Prolegomena'' did not apply directly to his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''. Some scholars question whether Frege's negative review of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' helped turn Husserl towards [[modern Platonism]], but he had already discovered the work of [[Bernard Bolzano]] independently around 1890/91.<ref>Alfred Schramm, ''Meinongian Issues in Contemporary Italian Philosophy'', Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 28.</ref> In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, [[G. W. Leibniz]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] as inspirations for his newer position.\n\nHusserl's review of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], published before Frege's landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes [[sense]] from [[reference]]; thus Husserl's notions of [[noema]] and object also arose independently.<ref name=\"r\" /> Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'', Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept. Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by [[School of Brentano|Brentano and his school]], and may have surfaced as early as Brentano's 1870s lectures on logic.\n\nScholars such as [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty|J. N. Mohanty]], [[Claire Ortiz Hill]], and [[Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock]], among others, have argued that Husserl's so-called change from [[psychologism]] to [[Platonism]] came about independently of Frege's review.<ref>Consider [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty]], 1995, \"The Development of Husserl's Thought\" in [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and David Woodruff Smith, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Husserl'', Cambridge University Press.

Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl's ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' we already find two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective. Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work. Frege's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass's Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives.\n\nFurthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic''. Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind\u2014that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset. He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and [[David Hume]].<ref>''Husserl-Chronik'', pp. 25\u201326</ref> Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change. In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege's ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', and again to question Frege's use of the word ''Bedeutung'' to designate \"reference\" rather than \"meaning\" (sense).\n\nIn a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' and Husserl's review of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]]'s ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik''. In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schr\u00f6der's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.\n\nCommentators argue that Husserl's notion of [[noema]] has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because ''noemata'' are necessarily fused with [[noesis|noeses]] which are the conscious activities of consciousness. ''Noemata'' have three different levels:\n* The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;\n* The ''noematic'' senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;\n* The [[Modal logic|modalities]] of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on).\nConsequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema. Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence concepts with no objects have no [[truth value]] in arguments. Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a \"state of affairs.\" Frege's notion of \"sense\" is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of \"meaning\" and \"object\" differ from those of Frege.\n\nIn detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that [[arithmetic]] could be derived from logic. For Husserl this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of [[geometry]]) is the ontological correlate of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other.\n\n===Husserl's criticism of psychologism===\nReacting against authors such as [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]], [[Christoph von Sigwart]] and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i.e. their conception of these abstract and ''a priori'' sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature. According to [[psychologism]], logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical \"art\" of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did)<ref>See the quotes in Carlo Ierna, \u201cHusserl\u2019s Critique of Double Judgments\u201d, in: Filip Mattens, editor, ''Meaning and Language: Phenomenological Perspectives'', Phaenomenologica 187 (Dordrecht/Boston/London: Springer, 2008, pp. 50 f.</ref> or a description of the factual processes of human thought. Husserl pointed out that the failure of [[Anti-psychologism|anti-psychologists]] to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side. Pure logic does not deal at all with \"thoughts\" or \"judgings\" as mental episodes but about ''a priori'' laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves.\n\n:\"Here \u2018Judgement\u2019 has the same meaning as \u2018proposition\u2019, understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning. This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic. Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions.\"<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', volume 1, edited by Dermot Moran, trans. by J.N. Findlay (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 112.</ref>\n\nSince \"truth-in-itself\" has \"being-in-itself\" as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism. Psychologists have also not been successful in showing how from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] or psychological processes we can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.\n\nThis confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as [[Biological determinism|biologism]] and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:\n\n1. The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature. Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i.e., that logic itself proposes ''a priori'' laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic. Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: If we have a formula like \"(a + b)(a \u2013 b) = a\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2\" it does not tell us how to think mathematically. It just expresses a truth. A proposition that says: \"The product of the sum and the difference of a and b ''should'' give us the difference of the squares of a and b\" does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement ''is based on'' the theoretical statement \"(a + b)(a \u2013 b) = a\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2\".\n\n2. For psychologists, the acts of judging, [[reason]]ing, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes. Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes. Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a \"met\u00e1basis eis \u00e1llo g\u00e9nos\" ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \"a transgression to another field\").<ref>Gutland, C., ''Denk-Erfahrung: Eine ph\u00e4nomenologisch orientierte Untersuchung der Erfahrbarkeit des Denkens und der Gedanken'' ([[Freiburg im Breisgau]]/Munich: Verlag Karl Alber, 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UlqUDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA344 p. 344].</ref>{{rp|344}} It is a met\u00e1basis because psychology cannot provide any foundations for ''a priori'' laws which themselves are the basis for all the ways we should think correctly. Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities. It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on. Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not.\n\n3. Judgments can be true or not true. Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become \"evidently\" true to us.<ref>Drummond, J. J., ''Husserlian Intentionality and Non-Foundational Realism: Noema and Object'' ([[Berlin]]/[[Heidelberg]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Academic Publishers]], 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=osu3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA261 p. 261].</ref>{{rp|261}} This evidence, a psychological process that \"guarantees\" truth, is indeed a psychological process. Husserl responds by saying that truth itself, as well as logical laws, always remain valid regardless of psychological \"evidence\" that they are true. No psychological process can explain the ''a priori'' objectivity of these [[logical truth]]s.\n\nFrom this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a Platonist conception of logic. This means that we should regard logical and mathematical laws as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Grabmal Edmund Husserl Freiburg G\u00fcnterstal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Husserl's gravestone at [[Freiburg|Freiburg G\u00fcnterstal]]]]\n[[David Carr (phenomenology scholar)|David Carr]] commented on Husserl's following in his 1970 dissertation at Yale: \"It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task\" as originally intended by the radical new science.<ref>Carr, David (1970) \"Translator's Introduction\" xv\u2013xlii, at xxv, to Edmund Husserl, ''The Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology''.

From 1939 he collaborated with [[Eugen Fink]] at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy|Husserl-Archives]] in Leuven. In 1954 he became leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.\n\n[[Eugen Fink]] was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the ''Sixth Cartesian Meditation'' which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work.  Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" />\n\n[[Roman Ingarden]], an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In his ''Sp\u00f3r o istnienie \u015bwiata'' (Ger.: \"Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt\", Eng.: \"Dispute about existence of the world\") he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.\n\n[[Max Scheler]] met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at G\u00f6ttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung'' (1913). Scheler's work ''Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value'' appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler's legal troubles, and Scheler returned to [[Munich]].<ref>John Raphael Staude, ''Max Scheler'' (New York: Free Press 1967) at 19\u201320, 27\u201328.</ref> Although Scheler later criticised Husserl's idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a \"phenomenology of love\", he states that he remained \"deeply indebted\" to Husserl throughout his work.\n\n[[Nicolai Hartmann]] was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921 the prestige of Hartmann the Neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, was added to the Movement; he \"publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of ''die Ph\u00e4nomenologie''.\" Yet Hartmann's connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him as a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971).

Also that year he wrote on Husserl's ''Ideen'' (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl's ''M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes'' (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in [[Lithuania]]. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.<ref>Unsigned \"Preface\" at vii\u2013x, to ''Emmanuel Levinas.

Sartre rejected Husserl's transcendental interpretations begun in his ''Ideen'' (1913) and instead followed Heidegger's ontology.<ref>Sartre, ''The Transcendent of the Ego. An Existentialist Theory of Consciousness'' [1937] (New York: Noonday 1957).</ref>\n\n[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' is influenced by Edmund Husserl's work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space,<ref>See, for example, the influence of Husserl on Merleau-Ponty's conception of ''l'espace'' as expounded in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \"A Phenomenological Account of the Ontological Problem of Space\", ''Existentia Meletai-Sophias'', 12 (2002), pp.345\u2013364</ref> and temporality, including Husserl's theory of [[retention and protention]]. Merleau-Ponty's description of 'motor intentionality' and sexuality, for example, retain the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of ''Ideas I'', yet further concretize what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition.  Merleau-Ponty's most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, \"the Philosopher and His Shadow.\"  Depending on the interpretation of Husserl's accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl's ''Phenomenological Psychology''<ref>Lectures, Summer Semester, 1925</ref> and ''Experience and Judgment'', it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the \"eidetic reduction\" nor the \"pure essence\" said to result.<ref>Remy C.

He expressed very strong appreciation for Husserl's work, especially with regard to \"bracketing\" or ''epoch\u00e9''.\n\n[[Hermann Weyl]]'s interest in [[intuitionistic logic]] and [[impredicativity]] appears to have resulted from his reading of Husserl. He was introduced to Husserl's work through his wife, Helene Joseph, herself a student of Husserl at G\u00f6ttingen.\n\n[[Colin Wilson]] has used Husserl's ideas extensively in developing his \"New Existentialism,\" particularly in regards to his \"intentionality of consciousness,\" which he mentions in a number of his books.<ref>{{cite book |author=Colin Wilson |title=Introduction to the New Existentialism |year=1966 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=978-0704504158 |page=54|author-link=Colin Wilson }}</ref>\n\n[[Rudolf Carnap]] was also influenced by Husserl,<ref>Smith, D.

Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 8 n. 18.</ref> not only concerning Husserl's notion of essential insight that Carnap used in his ''Der Raum'', but also his notion of \"formation rules\" and \"transformation rules\" is founded on Husserl's philosophy of logic.\n\nKarol Wojtyla, who would later become Pope [[John-Paul II|John Paul II]], was influenced by Husserl. Phenomenology appears in his major work, ''The Acting Person'' (1969). Originally published in Polish, it was translated by Andrzej Potocki and edited by [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] in the ''Analecta Husserliana''. ''The Acting Person'' combines phenomenological work with [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[ethics]].<ref>{{citation | last=Wojtyla | first=Karol | author-link=Pope John Paul II | title=The Acting Person: A Contribution to Phenomenological Anthropology | publisher=Springer | year=2002 | isbn=90-277-0985-8 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edmund Husserl.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque commemorating Husserl in his home town of [[Prost\u011bjov]], [[Czech Republic]]]]\n[[Paul Ric\u0153ur]] has translated many works of Husserl into French and has also written many of his own studies of the philosopher.<ref>Cf., Paul Ric\u0153ur, ''Husserl.

These included his dissertation, ''The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy,'' and also his introduction to ''The Origin of Geometry''. Derrida continued to make reference to Husserl in works such as ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.\n\n[[Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski]] and [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] were inspired by Husserl's formal analysis of language. Accordingly, they employed phenomenology in the development of [[categorial grammar]].<ref>Cf. {{citation | last=Smith | first=Barry | author-link=Barry Smith (ontologist) | title=On the Origins of Analytic Philosophy | journal=Grazer Philosophische Studien | volume=34 | year=1989 | pages=153\u2013173 | url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/dummett.pdf }}</ref>\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] visited Husserl at Freiburg in 1934. He credited phenomenology for having 'liberated him' from a narrow neo-Kantian thought. While perhaps not a phenomenologist himself, he introduced the philosophy to [[Iberia]] and [[Latin America]].<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert and Schuhmann, Karl (1982). ''The Phenomenological Movement''. Springer. pp. 658\u2013659.</ref>\n\n[[Wilfrid Sellars]], an influential figure in the so-called \"Pittsburgh School\" ([[Robert Brandom]], [[John McDowell]]) had been a student of [[Marvin Farber]], a pupil of Husserl, and was influenced by phenomenology through him:\n\n{{quote|Marvin Farber led me through my first careful reading of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' and introduced me to Husserl.

In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called [[Bracketing (phenomenology)|phenomenological reduction]]. Arguing that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] [[consciousness]] sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental-idealist]] philosophy.

He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children. His father was a [[milliner]]. His childhood was spent in Prost\u011bjov, where he attended the secular elementary school. Then Husserl traveled to [[Vienna]] to study at the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' there, followed next by the Staatsgymnasium in [[Olomouc]] (Ger.: Olm\u00fctz).<ref name=\"KockelmansBiographical\">Joseph J.

At Leipzig he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], one of the founders of modern psychology. Then he moved to the [[Frederick William University]] of [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) in 1878 where he continued his study of mathematics under [[Leopold Kronecker]] and the renowned [[Karl Weierstrass]]. In Berlin he found a mentor in [[Thomas Masaryk]], then a former philosophy student of [[Franz Brentano]] and later the first president of [[Czechoslovakia]]. There Husserl also attended [[Friedrich Paulsen]]'s philosophy lectures. In 1881 he left for the [[University of Vienna]] to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of [[Leo K\u00f6nigsberger]] (a former student of Weierstrass). At Vienna in 1883 he obtained his PhD with the work ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Variationsrechnung'' (''Contributions to the [[Calculus of variations|Calculus of Variations]]'').<ref name=\"KockelmansBiographical\"/>\n\nEvidently as a result of his becoming familiar with the [[New Testament]] during his twenties, Husserl asked to be baptized into the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1886. Husserl's father Adolf had died in 1884. [[Herbert Spiegelberg]] writes, \"While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience.\" At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral \"renewal\". Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational ''autonomy'' in all things, Husserl could also speak \"about his vocation and even about his mission under God's will to find new ways for philosophy and science,\" observes Spiegelberg.<ref>Spiegelberg, H. ''The Phenomenological Movement. A historical introduction''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. {{ISBN|9024702399}}. Vol. I, pp. 85\u201387. It was reported \"from witnesses of Husserl's last days \u2013 that Husserl had something like a deathbed conversion.\" Spiegelberg (1971) at I:85.</ref>\n\nFollowing his PhD in mathematics, Husserl returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to [[Karl Weierstrass]]. Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy. Then professor Weierstrass became very ill. Husserl became free to return to Vienna where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to [[philosophy]]. In 1884 at the [[University of Vienna]] he attended the lectures of [[Franz Brentano]] on philosophy and philosophical [[psychology]]. Brentano introduced him to the writings of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[John Stuart Mill|J. Stuart Mill]], and [[David Hume]]. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e.g., with regard to [[intentionality]].<ref>Spiegelberg, H., ''The Context of the Phenomenological Movement'' (Berlin/Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media]], 1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XVVFBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA134 p. 134].</ref> Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed [[Carl Stumpf]], a former student of Brentano, to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], seeking to obtain his [[habilitation]] which would qualify him to teach at the university level. There, under Stumpf's supervision, he wrote ''\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl'' (''On the Concept of Number'') in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik]]'' (1891).<ref>Kockelmans, \"Biographical Note\" per Edmund Husserl, 17\u201320, at 17\u201318, in his edited ''Phenomenology'' (Doubleday Anchor 1967). 'Husserl's 'Philosophie der Arithmetik'' is further discussed here below.</ref>\n\nIn 1887 Husserl married Malvine Steinschneider, a union that would last over fifty years. In 1892 their daughter Elizabeth was born, in 1893 their son [[Gerhart Husserl|Gerhart]], and in 1894 their son Wolfgang. Elizabeth would marry in 1922, and Gerhart in 1923; Wolfgang, however, became a casualty of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" /> Gerhart would become a philosopher of law, contributing to the subject of [[comparative law]], teaching in the United States and after the war in [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gerhart Husserl; by H.

In 1891 he published his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen]]'' which, drawing on his prior studies in mathematics and philosophy, proposed a psychological context as the basis of mathematics. It drew the adverse notice of [[Gottlob Frege]], who criticized its [[psychologism]].<ref>Cf., \"Illustrative extracts from Frege's Review of Husserl's ''Philosophie der Arithmetik''\", translated by P.T.Geach, at 79\u201385, in Peter Geach and Max Black, editors, ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1977).</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ Edmund Husserl].

Just prior to this a major work of his, ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (Halle, 1900\u20131901), was published. Volume One contains seasoned reflections on \"pure logic\" in which he carefully refutes \"psychologism\".<ref>Husserl's ''Logische'', in its disentangling of psychology from logic, also served as preparation for the later development of his work in [[phenomenological reduction]].

Ric\u0153ur traces Husserl's development from the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' to his later ''Ideen'' (1913), as leading from the psychological to the transcendental, regarding the intuition of essences (which the methodology of the [[phenomenological reduction]] allows). The book ''Husserl'' contains translations of Ric\u0153ur's essays of 1949\u20131967.</ref> This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey. Two years later in Italy he paid a visit to Franz Brentano his inspiring old teacher and to [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] the mathematician. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] were also now influencing his thought. In 1910 he became joint editor of the journal ''Logos''. During this period Husserl had delivered lectures on ''internal time consciousness'', which several decades later his former student Heidegger edited for publication.<ref>Husserl, ''Vorlesungen zur Ph\u00e4nomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins'' (1928), translated as ''The Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness'' (Indiana University 1964).</ref>\n\nIn 1912 at Freiburg the journal ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung'' (\"Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research\") was founded by Husserl and his school, and which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930. His important work ''Ideen''<ref>Husserl, ''Ideen au einer reinen Ph\u00e4nomenologie und ph\u00e4nomenologischen Philosophie'' (1913), translated as ''Ideas. General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (New York: Macmillan 1931; reprint Collier), with \"Author's Preface to the English Edition\" at 5\u201322. Therein, Husserl in 1931 refers to \"Transcendental Subjectivity\" being \"a new field of experience\" opened as a result of practicing [[phenomenological reduction]], and giving rise to an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' science not empirically based but somewhat similar to mathematics. By such practice the individual becomes the \"transcendental Ego\", although Husserl acknowledges the problem of [[solipsism]]. Later he emphasizes \"the necessary stressing of the difference between transcendental and psychological subjectivity, the repeated declaration that transcendental phenomenology is not in any sense psychology... \" but rather (in contrast to naturalistic psychology) by the phenomenological reduction \"the life of the soul is made intelligible in its most intimate and originally instuitional essence\" and whereby \"objects of the most varied grades right up to the level of the objective world are there for the Ego... .\" ''Ibid.'' at 5\u20137, 11\u201312, 18.</ref> was published in its first issue. Before beginning ''Ideen'' Husserl's thought had reached the stage where \"each subject is 'presented' to itself, and to each all others are 'presentiated' (''Vergegenw\u00e4rtigung''), not as parts of nature but as pure consciousness.\"<ref>Ricoeur, Paul (1967).

The [[University of Berlin]] in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. In 1926 Heidegger dedicated his book ''Sein und Zeit'' (''[[Being and Time]]'') to him \"in grateful respect and friendship.\"<ref>In the 1962 translation ''Being and Time'' by Macquarrie and Robinson, Heidegger states: \"Dedicated to ''Edmund Husserl'' in friendship and admiration.

A ''[[Festschrift]]'' to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 April 1929.\n\nDespite retirement, Husserl gave several notable lectures. The first, at Paris in 1929,<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Pariser Vortr\u00e4ge'' [1929], translated as ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967), by Peter Koestenbaum, with an \"Introductory Essay\" at ix\u2013lxxvii.</ref> led to ''[[Cartesian Meditations|M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes]]'' (Paris 1931).<ref>This work was published first in French.

From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts in order to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental [[Human ego|ego]] finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad.  This '[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental [[intersubjectivity]], which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings.  There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject.  One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the ''Cartesian Meditations'' itself becomes transcendent. It remains, however, alone (unconnected). Only the ego's grasp \"by analogy\" of the Other (e.g., by conjectural reciprocity) allows the possibility for an 'objective' intersubjectivity, and hence for community.<ref>Ricoeur, Paul (1967).

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> [[Gerhard Ritter]] was the only Freiburg faculty member to attend the funeral, as an anti-Nazi protest.\n\n===Heidegger and the Nazi era===\nHusserl was incorrectly rumoured to have been denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation of April 1933.<ref>Hugo Ott, ''Martin Heidegger, Unterwegs zu seiner Biographie''. Campus Verlag p.168, Walter Biemel \"Erinnerungsfragmente\" in Erinnerung an Martin Heidegger Neske 1977 S.22</ref> However, among other disabilities Husserl was unable to publish his works in Nazi Germany; cf. above footnote to ''Die Krisis'' (1936). It was also rumoured that his former pupil [[Martin Heidegger]] informed Husserl that he was discharged, but it was actually the previous rector.<ref>R\u00fcdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253\u20138.</ref>\nApparently Husserl and Heidegger had moved apart during the 1920s, which became clearer after 1928 when Husserl retired and Heidegger succeeded to his university chair. In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed:  e.g., Heidegger substituted ''Dasein'' [\"Being-there\"] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl. Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of [[Max Scheler]], were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various ''Kant Societies'' in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled ''Ph\u00e4nomenologie und Anthropologie''.<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971).

There they were deposited at [[Leuven]] to form the ''Husserl-Archives'' of the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]].<ref>Cf., Peter Koestenbaum, \"Introductory Essay\" ix\u2013lxxvii, at lxxv\u2013lxxvi, in his edited Edmund Husserl, ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967).

He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects.\n\nFrom Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between ''proper'' and ''improper'' presenting.<ref>Fisette, D., & Martinelli, R., eds., ''Philosophy from an Empirical Standpoint: Essays on Carl Stumpf'' ([[Leiden]]/[[Boston]]: [[Rodopi (publisher)|Brill Rodopi]], 2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1jFCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA159 p. 159].</ref>{{rp|159}} In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic, as he also calls it) one if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900\u20131901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as [[mereology]].<ref>{{citation| first=Peter | last=Simons | author-link=Peter Simons (professor) | title=Parts: A Study in Ontology | publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref>\n\nAnother important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is [[intentionality]], the notion that the main characteristic of [[consciousness]] is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of ''mental phenomena'', by which they could be distinguished from ''physical phenomena''. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the ''[[intentional object]]''). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.<ref>[[Roderick Chisholm|Chisholm, R. M.]] (1967). \"Intentionality\". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 4: 201.</ref>\n\n===The elaboration of phenomenology<!--linked from 'Michel Henry'-->===\nSome years after the 1900\u20131901 publication of his main work, the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (''Logical Investigations''), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness<ref>de Warren, N., ''Husserl and the Promise of Time: Subjectivity in Transcendental Phenomenology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDtsfIKAg4gC&pg=PA79 p. 79].</ref> and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by \"[[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called ''[[epoch\u00e9]]''. These new concepts prompted the publication of the ''Ideen'' (''Ideas'') in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the ''Logische Untersuchungen''.\n\nFrom the ''Ideen'' onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what we perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]. Husserl proposed that the world of objects\u2014and of ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects\u2014is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural standpoint\", which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them. Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \"constitute\" them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply \"external\" and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or \"type\". The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but \"bracketed\" as a way in which we regard objects{{emdash}}instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive (or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.<ref name=\"Boer1978\">{{cite book|author=Theodorus Boer|title=The Development of Husserl's Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XsudxFWboC&pg=PA121|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=31 December 1978|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-2039-2|page=121}}</ref>\n\nIn a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of [[intersubjectivity]], specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'', Meditation V). Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to scientific inquiry (and specifically to [[psychology]]) and what it means to \"bracket\" the natural attitude. ''The Crisis of the European Sciences'' is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]], emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) [[empirical]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] orientation. Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis,<ref>This assumption led Husserl to an idealistic position (which he originally had tried to overcome or avoid). On Husserl's phenomenological idealism see [[Hans K\u00f6chler]], ''Die Subjekt-Objekt-Dialektik in der transzendentalen Ph\u00e4nomenologie. Das Seinsproblem zwischen Idealismus und Realismus''.

II, 1935</ref>\n\n==Husserl's thought==\n{{Further|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}\nHusserl's thought is revolutionary in several ways, most notably in the distinction between \"natural\" and \"phenomenological\" modes of understanding. In the former, sense-perception in correspondence with the material realm constitutes the known reality, and understanding is premised on the accuracy of the perception and the objective knowability of what is called the \"real world\".<ref name=\"Keen2009\">{{cite book|author=Ralph Keen|title=Exile and Restoration in Jewish Thought: An Essay In Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZc5313lR8wC&pg=PA68|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-5308-2|page=68}}</ref> Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously \"presuppositionless\" by means of what Husserl calls \"[[phenomenological reduction]]\".<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'', tr.

Boyce Gibson (New York: Macmillan, 1962) 96\u2013103, 155\u201367.</ref> This reduction is not conditioned but rather transcendental: in Husserl's terms, pure consciousness of absolute Being.<ref>Husserl, ''Ideas'' 194.</ref> In Husserl's work, consciousness of any given thing calls for discerning its meaning as an \"intentional object\".<ref>Husserl, ''Ideas'' 242\u201343.</ref> Such an object does not simply strike the senses, to be interpreted or misinterpreted by mental reason; it has already been selected and grasped, grasping being an etymological connotation, of ''percipere'', the root of \"perceive\".<ref>Husserl, ''Ideas'' 105\u2013109; Mark P. Drost, 'The Primacy of Perception in Husserl's Theory of Imagining,' ''PPR 1'' (1990) 569\u201382. The German ''begreifen'', cognate with English 'grip,' carries the same sense.</ref>\n\n===Meaning and object===\nFrom ''Logical Investigations'' (1900/1901) to ''Experience and Judgment'' (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]. He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object.<ref>[[Super-recursive algorithm|Burgin, M.]], ''Theory of Knowledge: Structures and Processes'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmptDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA468 p. 468].</ref> Examples of this are \"the victor in Jena\" and \"the loser in Waterloo\", or \"the equilateral triangle\" and \"the equiangular triangle\"; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: \"Aristotle\", \"Socrates\", and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called \"universal names\"; their meaning is a \"[[concept]]\" and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way we know sensible objects is called \"[[Noumenon|sensible intuition]]\".\n\nHusserl also identifies a series of \"formal words\" which are necessary to form [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] and have no sensible [[wikt:correlate#Noun|correlates]]. Examples of formal words are \"a\", \"the\", \"more than\", \"over\", \"under\", \"two\", \"group\", and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls \"formal categories\". There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-[[ontological]] categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[Plural|forms of plural]], among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]], [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], part and whole, relation, and so on. The way we know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called \"categorial intuition\".\n\nThrough sensible intuition our [[consciousness]] constitutes what Husserl calls a \"situation of affairs\" (''Sachlage''). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented to us. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, we are able to constitute a \"[[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]]\" (''Sachverhalt''). One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. We can use it as basis to say, \"''a''<''b''\" and \"''b''>''a''\", two judgments which designate the same state of affairs. For Husserl a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] has a [[proposition]] or [[judgment]] as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base.<ref>Rosado Haddock, G. E., & Ortiz Hill, C., ''Husserl or Frege?: Meaning, Objectivity, and Mathematics'' ([[Chicago]] and [[LaSalle, Illinois|LaSalle]]: [[Open Court Publishing Company|Open Court]], 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4BgqIntkK5sC&pg=PA35 p. 35].</ref>{{rp|35}}\n\n===Philosophy of logic and mathematics===\nHusserl believed that ''truth-in-itself'' has as [[ontology|ontological]] correlate ''being-in-itself'', just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates. [[Logic]] is a formal theory of [[belief|judgment]], that studies the formal ''a priori'' relations among judgments using meaning categories. Mathematics, on the other hand, is [[formal ontology]]; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why we do not deal with sensible objects in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called \"categorial abstraction.\" Through this faculty we are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.\n\nThanks to \"eidetic intuition\" (or \"essential intuition\"), we are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic intuition, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.\n\nHusserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that give us objective knowledge of pure logic. All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted [[noema]]tically) as it is constituted by consciousness needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness).\n\nHusserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it.\n* The first stratum is what Husserl called a \"morphology of meanings\" concerning ''a priori'' ways to relate judgments to make them meaningful. In this stratum we elaborate a \"pure grammar\" or a logical syntax, and he would call its rules \"laws to prevent non-sense\", which would be similar to what logic calls today \"[[formal language|formation rules]]\". Mathematics, as logic's ontological correlate, also has a similar stratum, a \"morphology of formal-ontological categories\".\n* The second stratum would be called by Husserl \"logic of consequence\" or the \"logic of non-contradiction\" which explores all possible forms of true judgments. He includes here syllogistic classic logic, propositional logic and that of predicates. This is a semantic stratum, and the rules of this stratum would be the \"laws to avoid counter-sense\" or \"laws to prevent contradiction\". They are very similar to today's logic \"[[formal language|transformation rules]]\". Mathematics also has a similar stratum which is based among others on pure theory of pluralities, and a pure theory of numbers. They provide a science of the conditions of possibility of any theory whatsoever. Husserl also talked about what he called \"logic of truth\" which consists of the formal laws of possible truth and its modalities, and precedes the third logical third stratum.\n* The third stratum is [[metalogic]]al, what he called a \"theory of all possible forms of theories.\" It explores all possible theories in an ''a priori'' fashion, rather than the possibility of theory in general. We could establish theories of possible relations between pure forms of theories, investigate these logical relations and the deductions from such general connection. The logician is free to see the extension of this deductive, theoretical sphere of pure logic.\n\nThe ontological correlate to the third stratum is the \"[[manifolds|theory of manifolds]]\". In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner. It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all. Through the posit of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the [[Apodicticity|apodeictic]] connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved.\n\nAccording to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s (both [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]), [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra|theory of extension]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, [[Sophus Lie]]'s theory of [[transformation groups]], and [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]].\n\n[[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to \"desedimentize\" mathematics and the mathematical sciences.<ref>See especially Klein's [https://books.google.cz/books?id=EkPDAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover ''Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra''] (MIT Press, 1968).</ref>\n\n==Husserl and psychologism==\n\n===Philosophy of arithmetic and Frege===\nAfter obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the [[foundations of mathematics]] from a psychological point of view. In his [[habilitation thesis]], ''On the Concept of Number'' (1886) and in his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic (book)|Philosophy of Arithmetic]]'' (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano's descriptive psychology, to define the [[natural number]]s in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and other contemporary mathematicians. Later, in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena of Pure Logic'', Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the ''Prolegomena'' did not apply directly to his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''. Some scholars question whether Frege's negative review of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' helped turn Husserl towards [[modern Platonism]], but he had already discovered the work of [[Bernard Bolzano]] independently around 1890/91.<ref>Alfred Schramm, ''Meinongian Issues in Contemporary Italian Philosophy'', Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 28.</ref> In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, [[G. W. Leibniz]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] as inspirations for his newer position.\n\nHusserl's review of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], published before Frege's landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes [[sense]] from [[reference]]; thus Husserl's notions of [[noema]] and object also arose independently.<ref name=\"r\" /> Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'', Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept. Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by [[School of Brentano|Brentano and his school]], and may have surfaced as early as Brentano's 1870s lectures on logic.\n\nScholars such as [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty|J. N. Mohanty]], [[Claire Ortiz Hill]], and [[Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock]], among others, have argued that Husserl's so-called change from [[psychologism]] to [[Platonism]] came about independently of Frege's review.<ref>Consider [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty]], 1995, \"The Development of Husserl's Thought\" in [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and David Woodruff Smith, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Husserl'', Cambridge University Press.

Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl's ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' we already find two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective. Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work. Frege's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass's Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives.\n\nFurthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic''. Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind\u2014that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset. He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and [[David Hume]].<ref>''Husserl-Chronik'', pp. 25\u201326</ref> Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change. In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege's ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', and again to question Frege's use of the word ''Bedeutung'' to designate \"reference\" rather than \"meaning\" (sense).\n\nIn a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' and Husserl's review of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]]'s ''Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik''. In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schr\u00f6der's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.\n\nCommentators argue that Husserl's notion of [[noema]] has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because ''noemata'' are necessarily fused with [[noesis|noeses]] which are the conscious activities of consciousness. ''Noemata'' have three different levels:\n* The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;\n* The ''noematic'' senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;\n* The [[Modal logic|modalities]] of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on).\nConsequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema. Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence concepts with no objects have no [[truth value]] in arguments. Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a \"state of affairs.\" Frege's notion of \"sense\" is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of \"meaning\" and \"object\" differ from those of Frege.\n\nIn detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that [[arithmetic]] could be derived from logic. For Husserl this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of [[geometry]]) is the ontological correlate of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other.\n\n===Husserl's criticism of psychologism===\nReacting against authors such as [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]], [[Christoph von Sigwart]] and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i.e. their conception of these abstract and ''a priori'' sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature. According to [[psychologism]], logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical \"art\" of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did)<ref>See the quotes in Carlo Ierna, \u201cHusserl\u2019s Critique of Double Judgments\u201d, in: Filip Mattens, editor, ''Meaning and Language: Phenomenological Perspectives'', Phaenomenologica 187 (Dordrecht/Boston/London: Springer, 2008, pp. 50 f.</ref> or a description of the factual processes of human thought. Husserl pointed out that the failure of [[Anti-psychologism|anti-psychologists]] to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side. Pure logic does not deal at all with \"thoughts\" or \"judgings\" as mental episodes but about ''a priori'' laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves.\n\n:\"Here \u2018Judgement\u2019 has the same meaning as \u2018proposition\u2019, understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning. This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic. Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions.\"<ref>Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', volume 1, edited by Dermot Moran, trans. by J.N. Findlay (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 112.</ref>\n\nSince \"truth-in-itself\" has \"being-in-itself\" as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism. Psychologists have also not been successful in showing how from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] or psychological processes we can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.\n\nThis confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as [[Biological determinism|biologism]] and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:\n\n1. The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature. Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i.e., that logic itself proposes ''a priori'' laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic. Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: If we have a formula like \"(a + b)(a \u2013 b) = a\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2\" it does not tell us how to think mathematically. It just expresses a truth. A proposition that says: \"The product of the sum and the difference of a and b ''should'' give us the difference of the squares of a and b\" does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement ''is based on'' the theoretical statement \"(a + b)(a \u2013 b) = a\u00b2 \u2013 b\u00b2\".\n\n2. For psychologists, the acts of judging, [[reason]]ing, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes. Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes. Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a \"met\u00e1basis eis \u00e1llo g\u00e9nos\" ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \"a transgression to another field\").<ref>Gutland, C., ''Denk-Erfahrung: Eine ph\u00e4nomenologisch orientierte Untersuchung der Erfahrbarkeit des Denkens und der Gedanken'' ([[Freiburg im Breisgau]]/Munich: Verlag Karl Alber, 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UlqUDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA344 p. 344].</ref>{{rp|344}} It is a met\u00e1basis because psychology cannot provide any foundations for ''a priori'' laws which themselves are the basis for all the ways we should think correctly. Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities. It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on. Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not.\n\n3. Judgments can be true or not true. Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become \"evidently\" true to us.<ref>Drummond, J. J., ''Husserlian Intentionality and Non-Foundational Realism: Noema and Object'' ([[Berlin]]/[[Heidelberg]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Academic Publishers]], 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=osu3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA261 p. 261].</ref>{{rp|261}} This evidence, a psychological process that \"guarantees\" truth, is indeed a psychological process. Husserl responds by saying that truth itself, as well as logical laws, always remain valid regardless of psychological \"evidence\" that they are true. No psychological process can explain the ''a priori'' objectivity of these [[logical truth]]s.\n\nFrom this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a Platonist conception of logic. This means that we should regard logical and mathematical laws as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Grabmal Edmund Husserl Freiburg G\u00fcnterstal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Husserl's gravestone at [[Freiburg|Freiburg G\u00fcnterstal]]]]\n[[David Carr (phenomenology scholar)|David Carr]] commented on Husserl's following in his 1970 dissertation at Yale: \"It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task\" as originally intended by the radical new science.<ref>Carr, David (1970) \"Translator's Introduction\" xv\u2013xlii, at xxv, to Edmund Husserl, ''The Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology''.

From 1939 he collaborated with [[Eugen Fink]] at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy|Husserl-Archives]] in Leuven. In 1954 he became leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.\n\n[[Eugen Fink]] was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the ''Sixth Cartesian Meditation'' which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work.  Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.<ref name=\"HusserlPage\" />\n\n[[Roman Ingarden]], an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In his ''Sp\u00f3r o istnienie \u015bwiata'' (Ger.: \"Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt\", Eng.: \"Dispute about existence of the world\") he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.\n\n[[Max Scheler]] met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at G\u00f6ttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung'' (1913). Scheler's work ''Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value'' appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler's legal troubles, and Scheler returned to [[Munich]].<ref>John Raphael Staude, ''Max Scheler'' (New York: Free Press 1967) at 19\u201320, 27\u201328.</ref> Although Scheler later criticised Husserl's idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a \"phenomenology of love\", he states that he remained \"deeply indebted\" to Husserl throughout his work.\n\n[[Nicolai Hartmann]] was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921 the prestige of Hartmann the Neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, was added to the Movement; he \"publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of ''die Ph\u00e4nomenologie''.\" Yet Hartmann's connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him as a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.<ref>Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971).

Also that year he wrote on Husserl's ''Ideen'' (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl's ''M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes'' (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in [[Lithuania]]. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.<ref>Unsigned \"Preface\" at vii\u2013x, to ''Emmanuel Levinas.

Sartre rejected Husserl's transcendental interpretations begun in his ''Ideen'' (1913) and instead followed Heidegger's ontology.<ref>Sartre, ''The Transcendent of the Ego. An Existentialist Theory of Consciousness'' [1937] (New York: Noonday 1957).</ref>\n\n[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' is influenced by Edmund Husserl's work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space,<ref>See, for example, the influence of Husserl on Merleau-Ponty's conception of ''l'espace'' as expounded in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \"A Phenomenological Account of the Ontological Problem of Space\", ''Existentia Meletai-Sophias'', 12 (2002), pp.345\u2013364</ref> and temporality, including Husserl's theory of [[retention and protention]]. Merleau-Ponty's description of 'motor intentionality' and sexuality, for example, retain the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of ''Ideas I'', yet further concretize what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition.  Merleau-Ponty's most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, \"the Philosopher and His Shadow.\"  Depending on the interpretation of Husserl's accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl's ''Phenomenological Psychology''<ref>Lectures, Summer Semester, 1925</ref> and ''Experience and Judgment'', it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the \"eidetic reduction\" nor the \"pure essence\" said to result.<ref>Remy C.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}}\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre.\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five.

The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.

The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=I}}\n\n=== Performances and recordings ===\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} Performers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\nIn the 1920s, the large [[Bach Choir]] in London performed Bach's works conducted by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] , while [[Charles Kennedy Scott]] performed {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} with his Bach Cantata Club in chamber formation, which prompted a reviewer to write: {{quote|It would be absurd to forbid Bach's Motets to big choirs, but this performance left no doubt that the listener gets the truth of the music from voices few and picked.\"{{sfn|Haskell|1996|p=38}}}} They made the first recording of it, which was the first of any motet by Bach, in 1927, sung in English<!-- titled ''Jesus, Joy and Treasure''-->.{{sfn|Elste|2000}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}}\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre.\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\n===Time of origin===\nMost of Bach's motets are difficult to date, and {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is no exception.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf (score)|2002|p=V}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}} In 1912, Bernhard Friedrich Richter wrote that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was likely written in Bach's first year as {{lang|de|[[Thomaskantor]]}} in Leipzig, for the funeral of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, on 18 July 1723, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=IV}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to analyse the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, which led Smend to suggest that the work was composed in the 1720s.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} Looking at the four-part settings of the chorale movements 1, 7 and 11, which seem unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Bach's Weimar period, or even earlier, Melamed thought that the motet was likely in part compiled from music Bach had composed before his Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\n[[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} According to [[Richard D.&nbsp;P. Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing ''colla parte'' in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements (both five-part) mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements (both four-part). The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices. The central movement (Rom.&nbsp;8:9) is a five-part fugue.{{sfn|Posner|2020}}{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"700px\"\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''1'''<br />chorale<br />[[SATB]]<br />{{nowrap|(same as 11)}}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:1<br />SSATB<br />{{nowrap|(similar to 10)}}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" |\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''2'''<br />chorale<br /> SSATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:2<br />SSA\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''3'''<br />free<br />chorale<br />SSATB\n|}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:9<br />SSATB<br />fugue\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" |\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''4'''<br />chorale<br />SATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:10<br />ATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''5'''<br />chorale fantasia<br /> SSAT\n|}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:11<br />SSATB<br>{{nowrap|(similar to 2)}}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''6'''<br />chorale<br />SATB<br />(same as 1)\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n==== 1 ====\nThe motet begins with a four-part setting of the first stanza of the hymn{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=2}} \"{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}}\" (Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} This and the other movements related to the hymn are in E minor.

All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived.<!-- Three of the chorales were included in the Dietel manuscript of {{circa|1735}}.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}<!-- In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}}--> Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf (article)|2002|p=269}}\n\nTogether with other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA) of Bach's complete works, edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=I}}\n\n=== Performances and recordings ===\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} Performers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\nIn the 1920s, the large [[Bach Choir]] in London performed Bach's works conducted by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] , while [[Charles Kennedy Scott]] performed {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} with his Bach Cantata Club in chamber formation, which prompted a reviewer to write: {{quote|It would be absurd to forbid Bach's Motets to big choirs, but this performance left no doubt that the listener gets the truth of the music from voices few and picked.\"{{sfn|Haskell|1996|p=38}}}} They made the first recording of it, which was the first of any motet by Bach, in 1927, sung in English<!-- titled ''Jesus, Joy and Treasure''-->.{{sfn|Elste|2000}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989.
