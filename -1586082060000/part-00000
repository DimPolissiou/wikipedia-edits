The first lecture took place on February 1, 1920, conducted by [[academician]] [[Stepan Malkhasyants]].\n\nDuring the it first academic year, the university had single faculty of history and linguistics, with 32 academic staff and 262 students. Historian [[Hakob Manandyan]], linguist [[Manuk Abeghian]], historian [[Ashkharbek Kalantar]] along with Stepan Malkhasyants were among the first lecturers of the university. Later during the same year, the university was relocated to Yerevan and housed within the former Yerevan teachers' seminary building built between 1900 and 1906 on [[Abovyan Street|Astafyan Street]] (designed by architect Vasily Mirzoyan, currently home to the Faculty of Theology, Faculty of History and Faculty of Economics and Management).\n\n===During the Soviet period===\n[[File:Yerevan State University 2019 stamp of Armenia.png|thumb|The 2019 stamp of Armenia dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the university]]\nAfter the Sovietization of Armenia in December 1920, the university came to be known as the \"People's University of Yerevan\" starting from December 17 of the same year, with Hakob Manandyan as the new rector of the university.\n\nIn 1921, the university became home to 2 faculties: the faculty of [[physical sciences]] and the faculty of [[social sciences]]. In October 1921, 3 more faculties were opened: the faculty of oriental studies, the faculty of agriculture, and the faculty of technical studies. In March 1922, the faculties of medicine and pedagogy were opened, followed by the faculty of labor in 1923.\n\nOn October 20, 1923, the university was renamed as the \"State University of Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\" to become the \"mother university\" of Soviet Armenia within the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]. \n[[File:The Soviet Union 1970 CPA 3922 stamp (University Building and National Ornament).jpg|thumb|The 1970 Soviet stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the university.

In 1959, physics and mathematics were separated into 2 faculties.\n\nDuring the [[Stalinism|Stalinization]] period, the university was named after [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. However, during the [[de-Stalinization]] period, the university was renamed back as the \"Yerevan State University\".\n\nThe construction of the new headquarters of the university has been fulfilled during the 1950s, on the territory between Mravyan (now Alex Manoogian) and Charents streets, to the northeast of the [[Circular Park]]. The building was designed by architect Edmond Tigranyan.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1990, many new faculties were founded, modern laboratories were opened, and the centre of [[Armenian studies|Armenology]] was established. In 1991, there were 17 faculties in university.\n\nYerevan State University has been awarded with the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].\n\n===Post-independence===\n[[File:Sahak Partev and Mesrop Mashtots.jpg|thumb|The statues of [[Mesrop Mashtots]] and [[Sahak Partev]] (sculptor [[Ara Sargsian]]) erected in 2002, at the entrance to the YSU main building]]\nAfter the independence, the Ijevan campus of the Yerevan State University was opened in 1994.\n\nThe period of 1995\u201396 was crucial for the university with the beginning of new educational process, in order to meet the highest international standards. Thus, the faculties adopted two-grade system of education, providing Bachelor's and master's degrees.

It is composed of the rector, vice-rectors, scientific secretary, head of the educational administration, chief accountant, president of trade union, heads of YSU branches, scientific institutes, directors of centres, and deans of the YSU faculties.\n\n==Faculties==\nAs of 2016, the university has 19 faculties in Yerevan, as well as a ''Preparatory department for foreign citizens'':\n\n===Faculty of Physics===\n*Physics\n*Nuclear Physics (Physics of Nuclear Reactors)\n*Applied Mathematics and Physics\n\nThe process of training specialists in the field of physics and mathematics began in 1922 in YSU. The establishment of an independent faculty of Physics and Mathematics with separate Chairs of Physics and Mathematics in 1933 was a significant step towards developing physics in Armenia.\n\nTo strengthen the development of physics, and in order to provide more new specialists in our republic, the Faculty of Physics was separated from the Physical and Mathematical Faculty in 1959. The first dean of the Faculty was NAS RA Academician Norayr Kocharyan.\n\nThe Faculty staff is composed of highly qualified specialists. Currently NAS RA three Academicians and NAS RA five Associate members, 36 Doctors of Sciences, and more than 80 Candidates of Sciences are involved in the tutoring process of this Faculty.\n\nSince the 2006\u20132007 academic year, the Faculty has been offering the specialization of Pedagogue of Physics (distance learning).\n\nThe scientific-research activities, which are conducted in the laboratories of the Faculty, correspond to the present demands of the field both scientifically and technically.\n\nThere is also an equipped computer room with modern technologies, which enables students to get acquainted with modern scientific experiments and automated systems of technology management.\n\nDifferent international grants and many projects, financed by state budget, witness about the active scientific life at this Faculty.\n\nCurrently scientific-research activities are undertaken within the framework of 13 international grants (with the total financing of 1.5 million dollars) and 15 projects on budgetary financing (25% of budgetary themes and scientific positions of YSU).\n\n===Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics===\n*Mathematics\n*Actuarial Mathematics\n*Mechanics\n\nThe training of specialists in the area of mathematics was launched in YSU in 1924 at the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 1933 this department was transformed into Physico-mathematical Faculty. In 1959 the faculty was divided into two independent faculties: Mechanics and Mathematics and Physics. In 1963 a specialization Mathematical Cybernetics was offered at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. The later served as a basis for the foundation of the Faculty of Informatics and Applied Mathematics in 1972.\n\nIn 1988 the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics was divided into two faculties: Mechanics, Mathematics. And in 2007 those were again unified into one faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics.\n\nCurrently four Academicians, four NAS RA associate members, 17 doctors of sciences and 45 candidates of physico-mathematical sciences are involved in the tutoring process at this faculty. The faculty provides training in three specializations: mathematics, mechanics and actuarial mathematics. The educational system is three degrees system: bachelor, Master of Arts and postgraduate studies.\n\nThe faculty trains highly qualified specialists for different areas of modern mathematics.\n\nThe faculty's graduates get the bachelor's degree of a mathematician, master's degree in mathematics and also the qualification of teacher of mathematics. They can work in different scientific-research institutes, secondary schools and IHE.\n\nThe faculty management makes a focus on the development of branches of mathematics, which have great demand today. The launch of the specialization Actuarial Mathematics was a significant step regarding this issue. These specialists combine the specializations of mathematician, financial specialist, sociologist and investment manager.\n\nA reading hall, which provides the access to the literature, corresponding to the educational program, is at the disposal of the students. The electronic library and internet access are available, too.\n\nThe faculty has developed active scientific cooperation with a number of famous mathematical centers, IHE and scientific-research centers all over the world, such as NAS RA Institute of Mathematics, Moscow State University after M. Lomonosov, NAN RF Institute of Mathematics after Steklov in Russia, Trier University (Germany), Stockholm Royal Technological University (Sweden), TTU (Finland) and [[University of Applied Sciences in Schmalkalden]] in Germany.\n\n===Faculty of Radiophysics===\n*Radiophysics and Electronics\n*Physics of Semiconductors and Microelectronics\n*Telecommunications and Signals Development\n\nThe date of this Faculty's foundation is June, 1975. It was founded on the basis of the Faculty of Physics. The graduates of this faculty have deep knowledge in Theoretical Physics and high engineering skills.\n\nIn 1975 four chairs of this faculty trained 371 students. But in the mid-1980s the total number of students reached 650.\n\nDuring the 31 years of its existence, the faculty has trained more than 2500 specialists. 200 of them have different scientific degrees. Most of them have become outstanding scientists, managers of production, state officials. Part of them is involved in the academic process of the faculty.\n\nCurrently there are 4 chairs at this faculty; Ultra High Frequency Radiophysics and Telecommunications, Physics of Semiconductors and Microelectronics, Wave Process Theory and Physics, and Higher Mathematics as well as the Scientific-Research Center of Semiconductor Devices and Nanotechnologies.\n\nThree specializations are available at this faculty: radiophysics and electronics, physics of semi-conductors and microelectronics, telecommunications and signal research.\n\nThe specialization Synopsis is also available at this faculty, which trains specialists in the area of design of ultrahigh integral schemes. 420 students, bachelors and masters, are currently trained at the faculty. Two academicians, 15 doctors and professors and 33 candidates of sciences are occupied in the educational process at this faculty.\n\n===Faculty of Informatics and Applied Mathematics===\n*Informatics and Applied Mathematics\n\nThe Faculty of Informatics and Applied Mathematics (IAM) of the Yerevan State University is a leading educational and scientific centre preparing fundamental research scientists as well as highly qualified programmers.\n\nThe Faculty was founded in 1971 (initially called the Faculty of Applied Mathematics) on the base of the Chair of Computing Mathematics, which was established at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics in 1957. A decisive role in Faculty's establishment, defining the roadmap of its scientific research and preparing human resources for the Faculty was played by such distinguished scientists as: A.A. Lyapunov, S.N. Mergelyan, Yu.I. Zhuravlev. S.N. Mergelyan was also the first Head of the Chair of Numerical Analysis \u2013 one of the three Chairs of the newly founded Faculty.\n\nAt present the Faculty of IAM consists of three chairs: the Chair of Programming and Information Technologies, the Chair of Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science and the Chair of Numerical Analysis and Mathematical Modelling. The Staff of the Faculty includes more than 10 Doctors of Sciences and around 50 of the employees are Candidates of Science. Many of them are well-known not only in Armenia but also abroad. The Faculty prepares Bachelors specialized in \"Informatics and Applied Mathematics\" (both, full \u2013 and part-time). All three Chairs of the Faculty provide courses for this purpose. The Faculty provides master's degree in four different programmes. Three of them are carried out by the Faculty Chairs and one is being realized in collaboration with SYNOPSYS company. The study plan for the students of the Faculty provides a fundamental mathematical training and a wide spectrum of courses, related to computers and programming; a significant part of study is a practical work realized on computers.\n\nSince its establishment the Faculty of IAM has been collaborating productively with the Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines and the Institute for Informatics and Automation Problems of NAS of Armenia (former Computing Centre of Academy of Sciences of Armenian SSR), being the main provider of highly qualified specialists for these organizations.

It is composed of the rector, vice-rectors, scientific secretary, head of the educational administration, chief accountant, president of trade union, heads of YSU branches, scientific institutes, directors of centres, and deans of the YSU faculties.\n\n==Faculties==\nAs of 2016, the university has 19 faculties in Yerevan, as well as a ''Preparatory department for foreign citizens'':\n\n===Faculty of Physics===\n*Physics\n*Nuclear Physics (Physics of Nuclear Reactors)\n*Applied Mathematics and Physics\n\nThe process of training specialists in the field of physics and mathematics began in 1922 in YSU. The establishment of an independent faculty of Physics and Mathematics with separate Chairs of Physics and Mathematics in 1933 was a significant step towards developing physics in Armenia.\n\nTo strengthen the development of physics, and in order to provide more new specialists in our republic, the Faculty of Physics was separated from the Physical and Mathematical Faculty in 1959. The first dean of the Faculty was NAS RA Academician Norayr Kocharyan.\n\nThe Faculty staff is composed of highly qualified specialists. Currently NAS RA three Academicians and NAS RA five Associate members, 36 Doctors of Sciences, and more than 80 Candidates of Sciences are involved in the tutoring process of this Faculty.\n\nSince the 2006\u20132007 academic year, the Faculty has been offering the specialization of Pedagogue of Physics (distance learning).\n\nThe scientific-research activities, which are conducted in the laboratories of the Faculty, correspond to the present demands of the field both scientifically and technically.\n\nThere is also an equipped computer room with modern technologies, which enables students to get acquainted with modern scientific experiments and automated systems of technology management.\n\nDifferent international grants and many projects, financed by state budget, witness about the active scientific life at this Faculty.\n\nCurrently scientific-research activities are undertaken within the framework of 13 international grants (with the total financing of 1.5 million dollars) and 15 projects on budgetary financing (25% of budgetary themes and scientific positions of YSU).\n\n===Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics===\n*Mathematics\n*Actuarial Mathematics\n*Mechanics\n\nThe training of specialists in the area of mathematics was launched in YSU in 1924 at the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 1933 this department was transformed into Physico-mathematical Faculty. In 1959 the faculty was divided into two independent faculties: Mechanics and Mathematics and Physics. In 1963 a specialization Mathematical Cybernetics was offered at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. The later served as a basis for the foundation of the Faculty of Informatics and Applied Mathematics in 1972.\n\nIn 1988 the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics was divided into two faculties: Mechanics, Mathematics. And in 2007 those were again unified into one faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics.\n\nCurrently four Academicians, four NAS RA associate members, 17 doctors of sciences and 45 candidates of physico-mathematical sciences are involved in the tutoring process at this faculty. The faculty provides training in three specializations: mathematics, mechanics and actuarial mathematics. The educational system is three degrees system: bachelor, Master of Arts and postgraduate studies.\n\nThe faculty trains highly qualified specialists for different areas of modern mathematics.\n\nThe faculty's graduates get the bachelor's degree of a mathematician, master's degree in mathematics and also the qualification of teacher of mathematics. They can work in different scientific-research institutes, secondary schools and IHE.\n\nThe faculty management makes a focus on the development of branches of mathematics, which have great demand today. The launch of the specialization Actuarial Mathematics was a significant step regarding this issue. These specialists combine the specializations of mathematician, financial specialist, sociologist and investment manager.\n\nA reading hall, which provides the access to the literature, corresponding to the educational program, is at the disposal of the students. The electronic library and internet access are available, too.\n\nThe faculty has developed active scientific cooperation with a number of famous mathematical centers, IHE and scientific-research centers all over the world, such as NAS RA Institute of Mathematics, Moscow State University after M.

In the academic year of 2007\u20132008 the Italian language department was founded to replenish the already existing departments of English, French, German, Spanish and Translation studies.\n\nAbout 200 lecturers comprise the staff of the Faculty. Six of them are professors and more forty of them are candidates of sciences.\n\nThe main fields of the scientific investigations of the chairs are: Semantics, Text Linguistics, Lexicology, Pragmatics, Problems of Foreign Literature, Modern Methods of Teaching, Foreign languages, Translation Studies as well as other aspects of language studies.\n\nThe alumni of the faculty of Romance and Germanic Philology are successfully involved in the highest spheres of state and governmental structures, many different institutions and companies of the republic as well as in the embassies of foreign countries and international organizations functioning in the RA.\n\n===Faculty of Journalism===\n*Journalism\n\nYSU Department of Journalism was founded in 1949 as a part of the Faculty of Philology, but did not function permanently.\n\nAs a separate faculty YSU Faculty of Journalism was founded on 1 October 1991 by YSU Rectorate decision. First dean of the faculty, NAS RA Associate member Garnik Ananyan has got a great contribution in the process of foundation.\nBeing one of the youngest structures of YSU, Faculty of Journalism has got some significant advantages owing to its policy in the area of training process. All this states about that this faculty is the leading one in the area of training journalists among our HEI.\n\nThree-level educational system is available here: Bachelors, Masters of Arts and PHD studies. The skills, obtained by students during the first four years satisfy the demands of this specialization and they can start their professional way.\nAs for the magistracy, the duration of education here is two years.

Later more specialists start to work as lecturers.\n\nTwo chairs function in the structure of the faculty: Chair of the History and Theory of Press and Chair of Radio and TV Journalism. The training process at these chairs is provided by highly qualified and skillful specialists. There are graduates of the faculty among them.\n\nAll necessary conditions for the educational process are available at this faculty to provide the theoretical and practical processes.

Greater part of the educational process is realized virtually via electronic communication between students and professorial staff. The \"Event\" is an electronic periodical (www.ancudarc.am). It is the only electronic periodical in Armenia, where students are journalists and lecturers are editors.\n\nCooperation is established with the UN PIA in Armenia, OSCE Yerevan Office, EC Information Office in Armenia, European Commission Delegation and NATO IC.\nCooperation with leading foreign HEI is being developed permanently.\n\nThe professorial staff of the faculty is: 3 doctors, professors, 3 assistant professors, 8 candidates of philological sciences. The number of students is 334: Bachelors are 222 and Masters-62, from whom 50 prefer the distance learning.
