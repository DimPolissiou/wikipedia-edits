An aria is a formal musical composition unlike its counterpart, the [[Recitative|recitative]].\n\nAria is a baddie & dets ong. \nThe typical context for arias is [[opera]], but vocal arias also feature in [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. The term was originally used to refer to any expressive [[melody]], usually, but not always, performed by a singer.\n\n==Origins of the term==\nThe term, which derives from the Greek \u1f00\u03ae\u03c1 and Latin ''aer'' (air) first appeared in relation to music in the 14th century when it simply signified a manner or style of singing or playing. By the end of the 16th century, the term 'aria' refers to an instrumental form (cf. Santino Garsi da Parma lute works, 'Aria del Gran Duca'). By the early 16th century it was in common use as meaning a simple setting of [[strophe|strophic]] poetry; melodic [[madrigal]]s, free of complex [[polyphony]], were known as ''madrigale arioso''.<ref>Westrup et al. (n.d.), 1: Derivation</ref>\n\n==In opera==\n\n===Aria form in late 17th century French and Italian opera===\nIn the context of staged works and concert works, arias evolved from simple melodies into structured forms. In such works, the sung, melodic, and structured aria became differentiated from the more speech-like (''[[wikt:parlando|parlando]]'') [[recitative]] \u2013 broadly, the latter tended to carry the story-line, the former carried more emotional freight and became an opportunity for singers to display their vocal talent.\n\nThe aria evolved typically in one of two forms. [[Binary form]] arias were in two sections (A\u2013B); arias in [[ternary form]] (A\u2013B\u2013A) were known as ''[[da capo aria]]s'' (literally 'from the head', i.e. with the opening section repeated, often in a highly [[ornament (music)|decorated]] manner).<ref>Westrup et al. (n.d.), 2: Seventeenth century vocal music</ref> In the ''da capo'' aria the 'B' episode would typically be in a different [[key (music)|key]] \u2013 the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] or [[relative major]] key. Other variants of these forms are found in the French operas of the late 17th century such as those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] which dominated the period of the French baroque; vocal solos in his operas (denominated of course by the French term, ''airs'') are frequently in extended binary form (ABB') or sometimes in ''[[rondo|rondeau]]'' form (ABACA),<ref>Anthony (1991), 202\u2013205.</ref> (a shape which is analogous to the instrumental [[rondo]]).\n\nIn the Italian school of composers of the late 17th and early 18th century, the ''da capo'' form of aria came gradually to be associated with the ''[[ritornello]]'' (literally, 'little return'), a recurring instrumental episode which was interspersed with the elements of the aria and eventually provided, in early operas, the opportunity for dancing or entries of characters.<ref>Talbot (n.d.); Solie (1977), 54\u20135</ref> This version of aria form with ''ritornelli'' became a dominant feature of European opera throughout the 18th century. It is thought by some writers to be the origin of the instrumental forms of [[concerto]] and [[sonata form]].<ref>Solie (1977), 31.

The [[Bednore]] Dynasty, under whose rule this tract was at that time, was known to them as the Kannada Dynasty, i.e., the dynasty speaking the [[Kannada language]]. \"Kar\u0101valli\", the Kannada word for 'coast', is the term used by [[Kannadiga|Kannada-speakers]] to refer to this region. The letter 'd' being always pronounced like 'r' by the [[Europeans]], the district was named by them as 'Canara' (a corruption of the word \"Kannada\").

The North Canara (also sometimes cited as 'North Kanara') district was transferred to the [[Bombay Presidency]] whereas the [[South Canara]] (also sometimes referred as 'South Kanara') district remained under the jurisdiction of the [[Madras Presidency]].

This theater art involves acting, dance, dialogue, music, songs, story and unique costumes. While dance and songs adhere to well established '[[Tala (music)|tala]]s', very similar to classical Indian dance forms, acting and dialogues are created spontaneously on stage depending on the ability of the artists. This combination of classical and folk elements makes Yakshagana unique from any other Indian art. It would be considered a form of opera to the western eye. Traditionally, Yakshaganas start late in the night and run the entire night. Bagavatha, the background singer, who is also the director of the story controls the entire proceedings on stage. He/she along with the background musicians, who play '[[chande]]' and '[[maddale]]' form the 'himmela'. The actors who wear colorful costumes and enact various roles in the story form the 'mummela'. There are many professional troops in Karnataka. In spite of the competition from modern movie industry and television, these troops arrange ticketed shows and make a profit. Apart from the individually arranged shows in villages, inviting well known professional artists like Sri [[Chittani Ramachandra Hegde]] and Kondadakuli Ramachandra Hegde, provides an opportunity for local talents to act with the legends. Yakshagana is sometimes simply called aata\u0101 (meaning play) in both [[Tulu Language|Tulu]] and [[Kannada Language|Kannada]]. Yaksha-gana literally means the song (gana) of a yaksha. Yakshas were an exotic tribe mentioned in the Sanskrit literature of ancient India.\n\n[[Bhuta Kola]] and [[Nagaradhane]] are other unique rituals and traditions to coastal districts of present Karnataka state.\nThere are many more folk art forms which are in edge of extinction due to rapid changes in social, economic, educational conditions of the Karavali ( Kanara or Canara ) region.\n\n[[Bedara vesha]] In Sirsi Holi is celebrated with a unique Carnival.

This theater art involves acting, dance, dialogue, music, songs, story and unique costumes. While dance and songs adhere to well established '[[Tala (music)|tala]]s', very similar to classical Indian dance forms, acting and dialogues are created spontaneously on stage depending on the ability of the artists. This combination of classical and folk elements makes Yakshagana unique from any other Indian art. It would be considered a form of opera to the western eye. Traditionally, Yakshaganas start late in the night and run the entire night. Bagavatha, the background singer, who is also the director of the story controls the entire proceedings on stage. He/she along with the background musicians, who play '[[chande]]' and '[[maddale]]' form the 'himmela'. The actors who wear colorful costumes and enact various roles in the story form the 'mummela'. There are many professional troops in Karnataka. In spite of the competition from modern movie industry and television, these troops arrange ticketed shows and make a profit. Apart from the individually arranged shows in villages, inviting well known professional artists like Sri [[Chittani Ramachandra Hegde]] and Kondadakuli Ramachandra Hegde, provides an opportunity for local talents to act with the legends. Yakshagana is sometimes simply called aata\u0101 (meaning play) in both [[Tulu Language|Tulu]] and [[Kannada Language|Kannada]]. Yaksha-gana literally means the song (gana) of a yaksha. Yakshas were an exotic tribe mentioned in the Sanskrit literature of ancient India.\n\n[[Bhuta Kola]] and [[Nagaradhane]] are other unique rituals and traditions to coastal districts of present Karnataka state.\nThere are many more folk art forms which are in edge of extinction due to rapid changes in social, economic, educational conditions of the Karavali ( Kanara or Canara ) region.\n\n[[Bedara vesha]] In Sirsi Holi is celebrated with a unique Carnival. Folk dance called \"Bedara Vesha\", Which is performed during the nights beginning five days before the actual festival day. Different dancers are participate while dancing dancers are round whole Sirsi. The festival is celebrated every alternate year in the town which attracts a large crowd on all the five days from different parts of the India\n\n===Sports===\nThe Tulu speaking part of '''Karavali''' region has buffalo racing sport called [[Kambala]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Kanara region forms the [[Karnataka]]n coast situated on the south-western portion of [[South India|Peninsular India]].<ref name=\"ICA\">{{cite encyclopedia\n | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/India/The-Deccan#ref487185\n | title = India: Coastal areas \n | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]\n | date = 16 October 2019\n | publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]]\n | quote = From Goa south to Cape Comorin (the southernmost tip of India) is the Malabar coastal plain...\n | access-date = 19 October 2019\n}}\n</ref> Coastal Karnataka forms the northern segment of the [[Malabar coast]].<ref name=\"MC\">\n{{cite encyclopedia \n  | editor-last = Goldberg\n  | editor-first = Maren\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] \n  | title = Malabar Coast\n  | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Malabar-Coast\n  | access-date = 19 September 2019\n  | quote = Malabar Coast...the southern part of India\u2019s western coast, approximately from the state of Goa southward...\n  | publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]]\n}}\n</ref> Kanara constitutes an area of about 10,000 square kilometres (4,000 square miles).<ref name=\"KAN\">\n{{cite encyclopedia \n  | editor-last = Pletcher\n  | editor-first = Kenneth\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] \n  | title = Kanara \n  | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Kanara\n  | access-date = 19 September 2019\n  | quote = Kanara, region along the Malabar Coast of the Arabian Sea, western Karnataka state, India.\n  | publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]]\n}}\n</ref> It is bounded by [[Konkan]] to the north, the [[Western Ghats]] to the east, the [[Kerala]] [[Plain]]s to the south, and the [[Arabian Sea ]] to the west.<ref name=\"KC\">\n{{cite encyclopedia \n  | editor-last = Pletcher\n  | editor-first = Kenneth\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] \n  | title = Karnataka Coast\n  | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Karnataka-Coast#accordion-article-history\n  | access-date = 19 September 2019\n  | quote = Karnataka Coast, coastal lowlands in western Karnataka state, southwestern India... it is bounded by Konkan to the north...

According to Shia narrations, the book is said to have been composed after the [[Battle of Karbala]] (680 AD) and describes the relationship between man and God. Although the book is principally a collection of Islamic knowledge and thought in supplication form, it is said to have played an important part in the uprising against the [[Umayyads]]. According to some scholars {{who|date=July 2015}}, al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya is an example of the highest form of eloquence, and its contents have been described and explained in many books of commentary. The main part of the book is ''[[mutawatir]]'' (conveyed by successive narration), but over the years a number of scholars have written addenda to it. Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya is an important book for Shia Muslims.\n\n== Background ==\n''Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' is a collection of [[supplication]]s and whispered prayers composed by [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Sajjad]], the great-grandson of the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]]. The title \"al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya\" means \"the book of Sajjad\", Sajjad being the [[epithet]] of [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali ibn Husayn]], the fourth [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Imam]].\n\n''Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' has several titles, such as \"Sister of the [[Quran]]\", \"[[Gospel]] of the [[Ahl al-Bayt|Holy Household]]\" and \"[[Psalms]] of the Muhammad dynasty\", names which clearly indicate the importance of the book for Shia Islam.<ref name=al-islam.org>{{cite book|last1=introduction|first1=translated with an|last2=Chittick|first2=annotation by William C.|title=The perfect book of Imam Zaynul-A'abideen A'li Ibnul-Husayn as-Sajjad : as'-S'ah'eefatul-kaamilatus-sajjaadeeyah = a\u1e63- \u1e62a\u1e25\u012bfa al-k\u0101mila as-sa\u01e7\u01e7\u0101d\u012bya|date=2000|publisher=Ansariyan Publ.|location=Qum|isbn=9780946079568|edition=1.}}</ref> In the form of supplication, it expresses Islamic knowledge and thought and involves all aspects of individual, social, economical, political and cultural life.

However, the book is not merely a conversation with God; in [[supplication]] form, it is also a collection of Islamic knowledge and thought.<ref name=al-islam.org/> It emphasizes detachment from the material world, and addresses many moral and ethical issues.  \nAccording to scholars, ''al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' exhibits the highest level of [[eloquence]] and purity to be found in Arabic literature after the ''[[Quran]]'' and the ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' of [[Ali]], cousin and son-in-law of [[Muhammad]].<ref name=Rasheed>{{cite book|last1=al-Rasheed|first1=B\u0101qir Shar\u012bf al-Qurashi ; translated by J\u0101sim|title=The life of Im\u0101m Zayn al-\u02bbAbid\u012bn|date=2007|publisher=Ansariyan|location=Qum|isbn=9789644381652|pages=380\u2013390|edition=1st ed., 2nd repr.|url=http://www.maaref-foundation.com/english/library/pro_ahl/imam04_sajjad/zayn_al_abidin/16.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"KarimiFard\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/3076/124/text | title=Rhetorical points in the book al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya| author=KarimiFard, GholamReza | journal=Meshkat | year=1997 | month= | issue=53 |language=fa| pages=116\u2013134}}</ref><ref name=\"Persian Language and Literature Research \">{{cite journal | url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/835008 | title=Exquisite array in the book al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya | author=Mozaffari, Seddigheh | author2=Ibn al-Rasul, MuhammadReza| journal=Persian Language and Literature Research | year=2009 | volume=1 | issue=9 |language=fa| pages=141\u2013180}}</ref>\n\n=== Strategic importance ===\n''Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' was at the forefront of the uprising against the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]].<ref name=Rasheed/> Salutations to [[Muhammad]] and his dynasty are repeated in most of its supplications, while the Umayyad Caliphate consistently tried to wipe out the name and memory of Muhammad and his family.<ref name=Shahri/> In several supplications Imam Sajjad explains the concept of [[Imamate]] (leadership).  He explains what Imamate means, who is allowed to be an [[imam]] (leader), and what the conditions of Imamate are, because the subject of prophet succession and the concept of Imamate were faced with serious challenge after the death of [[Muhammad]] and particularly after the [[Battle of Karbala]].  For the protection of Islamic territory, which had been won through the endeavours of Muhammad and his companions, Imam Sajjad in several supplications talks about important matters such as [[jihad]] and martyrdom, the protection of borders, [[enjoining good and forbidding wrong]], combat power, the powerlessness of enemies, awareness, military equipment, and so on. In expressing the ideas, virtues, attributes and characteristics of God's fighters, officials and border guards, he explains the true Islamic idea.<ref name=Hosun/>\n\n== Authenticity ==\nAccording to [[Shia Islam|Shia]] tradition, Imam Sajjad collected his supplications and taught them to his family, particularly his sons, [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali|Zayd]]. These supplications were written down by others and the text over time became widely disseminated among all Shia.

According to Shia narrations, the book is said to have been composed after the [[Battle of Karbala]] (680 AD) and describes the relationship between man and God. Although the book is principally a collection of Islamic knowledge and thought in supplication form, it is said to have played an important part in the uprising against the [[Umayyads]]. According to some scholars {{who|date=July 2015}}, al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya is an example of the highest form of eloquence, and its contents have been described and explained in many books of commentary. The main part of the book is ''[[mutawatir]]'' (conveyed by successive narration), but over the years a number of scholars have written addenda to it. Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya is an important book for Shia Muslims.\n\n== Background ==\n''Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' is a collection of [[supplication]]s and whispered prayers composed by [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Sajjad]], the great-grandson of the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]]. The title \"al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya\" means \"the book of Sajjad\", Sajjad being the [[epithet]] of [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali ibn Husayn]], the fourth [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Imam]].\n\n''Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' has several titles, such as \"Sister of the [[Quran]]\", \"[[Gospel]] of the [[Ahl al-Bayt|Holy Household]]\" and \"[[Psalms]] of the Muhammad dynasty\", names which clearly indicate the importance of the book for Shia Islam.<ref name=al-islam.org>{{cite book|last1=introduction|first1=translated with an|last2=Chittick|first2=annotation by William C.|title=The perfect book of Imam Zaynul-A'abideen A'li Ibnul-Husayn as-Sajjad : as'-S'ah'eefatul-kaamilatus-sajjaadeeyah = a\u1e63- \u1e62a\u1e25\u012bfa al-k\u0101mila as-sa\u01e7\u01e7\u0101d\u012bya|date=2000|publisher=Ansariyan Publ.|location=Qum|isbn=9780946079568|edition=1.}}</ref> In the form of supplication, it expresses Islamic knowledge and thought and involves all aspects of individual, social, economical, political and cultural life.

However, the book is not merely a conversation with God; in [[supplication]] form, it is also a collection of Islamic knowledge and thought.<ref name=al-islam.org/> It emphasizes detachment from the material world, and addresses many moral and ethical issues.  \nAccording to scholars, ''al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' exhibits the highest level of [[eloquence]] and purity to be found in Arabic literature after the ''[[Quran]]'' and the ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' of [[Ali]], cousin and son-in-law of [[Muhammad]].<ref name=Rasheed>{{cite book|last1=al-Rasheed|first1=B\u0101qir Shar\u012bf al-Qurashi ; translated by J\u0101sim|title=The life of Im\u0101m Zayn al-\u02bbAbid\u012bn|date=2007|publisher=Ansariyan|location=Qum|isbn=9789644381652|pages=380\u2013390|edition=1st ed., 2nd repr.|url=http://www.maaref-foundation.com/english/library/pro_ahl/imam04_sajjad/zayn_al_abidin/16.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"KarimiFard\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/3076/124/text | title=Rhetorical points in the book al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya| author=KarimiFard, GholamReza | journal=Meshkat | year=1997 | month= | issue=53 |language=fa| pages=116\u2013134}}</ref><ref name=\"Persian Language and Literature Research \">{{cite journal | url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/835008 | title=Exquisite array in the book al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya | author=Mozaffari, Seddigheh | author2=Ibn al-Rasul, MuhammadReza| journal=Persian Language and Literature Research | year=2009 | volume=1 | issue=9 |language=fa| pages=141\u2013180}}</ref>\n\n=== Strategic importance ===\n''Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya'' was at the forefront of the uprising against the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]].<ref name=Rasheed/> Salutations to [[Muhammad]] and his dynasty are repeated in most of its supplications, while the Umayyad Caliphate consistently tried to wipe out the name and memory of Muhammad and his family.<ref name=Shahri/> In several supplications Imam Sajjad explains the concept of [[Imamate]] (leadership).  He explains what Imamate means, who is allowed to be an [[imam]] (leader), and what the conditions of Imamate are, because the subject of prophet succession and the concept of Imamate were faced with serious challenge after the death of [[Muhammad]] and particularly after the [[Battle of Karbala]].  For the protection of Islamic territory, which had been won through the endeavours of Muhammad and his companions, Imam Sajjad in several supplications talks about important matters such as [[jihad]] and martyrdom, the protection of borders, [[enjoining good and forbidding wrong]], combat power, the powerlessness of enemies, awareness, military equipment, and so on. In expressing the ideas, virtues, attributes and characteristics of God's fighters, officials and border guards, he explains the true Islamic idea.<ref name=Hosun/>\n\n== Authenticity ==\nAccording to [[Shia Islam|Shia]] tradition, Imam Sajjad collected his supplications and taught them to his family, particularly his sons, [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali|Zayd]]. These supplications were written down by others and the text over time became widely disseminated among all Shia. Specialists in the study of [[Hadith]] maintain that the text is ''[[mutawatir]]'' (conveyed by successive narration).<ref name=al-islam.org/>\n\n== Addenda ==\nA number of scholars have written addenda to ''al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya''.

Gambas is also the word for [[prawn]]s in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[French language|French]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] languages, from which the project's logos are derived.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Gambas 1.0.15 es.png|200px|left|thumb|Gambas 1.0.15 running from KDE]]\nGambas was developed by the [[French people|French]] programmer [[Beno\u00eet Minisini]], with its first release coming in 1999. Beno\u00eet had grown up with the BASIC language, and decided to make a free software development environment that could quickly and easily make programs with user interfaces.<ref name=\"influenced\"/>\n\nThe Gambas 1.x versions featured an interface made up of several different separate windows for forms and IDE dialogues in a similar fashion to [[GIMP#User interface|the interface]] of earlier versions of the [[GIMP]]. It could also only develop applications using [[Qt (software)|Qt]] and was more oriented towards the development of applications for [[KDE]].<ref name=\"codefez\">{{cite web | url=http://codefez.com/gambas-a-fast-visual-basic-for-linux/ | title=Gambas: A Fast Visual Basic for Linux | publisher=CodeFez | accessdate=2007-04-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909105431/http://codefez.com/gambas-a-fast-visual-basic-for-linux/ | archive-date=2009-09-09 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  The last release of the 1.x versions was Gambas 1.0.19.\n\n[[Image:Gambas-ubuntu.png|200px|right|thumb|Gambas 2.7 with Russian interface]]\nThe first of the 2.x versions was released on January 2, 2008 after three to four years of development. It featured a major redesign of the interface, now with all forms and functions embedded in a single window, as well as some changes to the Gambas syntax, although for the most part code compatibility was kept. It featured major updates to existing Gambas components as well as the addition of some new ones, such as new components that could use [[GTK+]] or [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] for drawing or utilize [[OpenGL]] acceleration. Gambas 2.x versions can load up and run Gambas 1.x projects, with occasional incompatibilities; the same is true for Gambas 2.x to 3.x, but not from Gambas 1.x to 3.x.\n\nThe next major iteration of Gambas, the 3.x versions, was released on December 31, 2011.<ref name=\"TheH\">{{cite web | url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Gambas-3-0-for-BASIC-with-bug-and-security-fixes-1403082.html | title=Gambas 3.0 for BASIC with bug and security fixes | publisher=The H | accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> A 2015 benchmark published on the Gambas website showed Gambas 3.8.90 scripting as being faster to varying degrees than [[Perl]] 5.20.2 and the then-latest 2.7.10 version of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in many tests.<ref name=\"benchmark\">{{cite web | url=http://gambaswiki.org/wiki/doc/benchmark | title=Benchmarking | publisher=Gambas Website| accessdate=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\n[[Image:Gambas-2.7.0-fedora-blackbox.png|200px|thumb|left|Gambas 2.7.0 running on [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Linux]] with [[Blackbox]]]]\nGambas is designed to build [[graphical user interface|graphical]] programs using the [[Qt (software)|Qt]] (currently Qt 4.x or 5.x) or the [[GTK+]] toolkit (GTK 3.x also supported as of 3.6.0); the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas.<ref name=\"penguinsightings-replace\">{{cite web |url=http://gambaswiki.org/wiki/doc/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions |website=Gambas Documentation |accessdate=2014-11-17}}</ref> Gambas includes a GUI designer to aid in creating user interfaces, but can also make [[Command-line interface|command line]] applications,<ref>[http://pclosmag.com/html/Issues/200810/page04.html An Alphabet of Computer Languages: BASIC], [[PCLinuxOS]] Magazine</ref> as well as [[text-based user interface]]s using the [[ncurses]] toolkit.<ref>[http://captainbodgit.blogspot.com/2017/03/gambas-cli-programming-ncurses-text.html Gambas cli programming: ncurses text based user interface]</ref> The Gambas [[Runtime system|runtime]] environment is needed to run executables.\n\nFunctionality is provided by a variety of components, each of which can be selected to provide additional features.<ref name=\"osnews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/8849/Regarding_Gambas/page1|first=Daniel |last=Fernandez|title=Regarding Gambas |date=2004-11-11 |publisher=OSNews |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref> Drawing can be provided either through Qt and GTK+ toolkits, with an additional component which is designed to switch between them.<ref name=\"linux.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://old.linux.co.uk//docs/center/featured-software/gambas-rad |title=Gambas RAD |publisher=Linux.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525123939/http://old.linux.co.uk/ |archive-date=2011-05-25 |df= }}</ref> Drawing can also be provided through the [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (originally version 1.x, with 2.x added as of 3.7.0)<ref name=\"sdl2\">{{cite web|url=http://git.net/gambas-development-environment-basic/msg17384.html |title=Why a new SDL component? |publisher=Gambas Mailing List |access-date=2015-02-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209211934/http://git.net/gambas-development-environment-basic/msg17384.html |archive-date=2015-02-09 |df= }}</ref>, which can also be utilized for audio playback through a separate sound component (a component for the [[OpenAL]] specification has also been added).

The IDE also includes a tool for the creation of [[Package manager|installation packages]], supporting [[GNU Build System|GNU Autotools]], [[slackpkg]], [[Arch Linux#Pacman|pacman]], [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]], and [[deb (file format)|debs]] (the latter two then tailored for [[Linux distribution|specific distributions]] such as [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]/[[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]]/[[CentOS]], [[Mageia]], [[Mandriva]], [[OpenSUSE]] and [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]/[[Linux Mint|Mint]]).\n\nGambas since version 3.2 [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] has integrated [[Profiling (computer programming)|profiler]] and it started to use [[Just-in-time compilation]] technology.\n\n=== Differences from Visual Basic ===\nGambas is intended to provide a similar experience as developing in Microsoft [[Visual Basic]], but it is not a [[free software]] [[Clone (computing)#Software|clone]] of the popular proprietary program. The author of Gambas makes it clear that there are similarities to Visual Basic, such as syntax for BASIC programs and the integrated development environment; Gambas was written from the start to be a development environment of its own and seeks to improve on the formula.<ref>{{cite web | author=Mark Alexander Bain | title=Gambas&nbsp;-- Almost Visual Basic on Linux | publisher=Suite101 | date=2008-08-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Issues/2008/95/Gambas-Basic-IDE/ | author=Frank Wieduwilt  | title=Programming with the Gambas Basic IDE | publisher=Linux Pro Magazine| date=October 2008 | accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.awce.com/gp3-gambas.html | author=\tAWC Electronics | title=Physical Computing with Linux: A Rapid Approach using Gambas | accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nIts [[object model]] and each class being represented in a file, the archiver to package the program is inspired by the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]]. Gambas is intended to be an alternative for former Visual Basic developers who have decided to migrate to Linux. There are also other important distinctions between the Gambas and Visual Basic. One notable example is that in Gambas [[Array data structure|array indexes]] always start with 0, whereas Visual Basic indexes can start with 0 or 1.<ref name=\"visualbasic\">{{cite web | url=http://gambasdoc.org/help/doc/diffvb | title=Differences from Visual Basic | publisher=Gambas Website | accessdate=2011-05-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511042420/http://gambasdoc.org/help/doc/diffvb | archive-date=2011-05-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Gambas also supports the [[Comparison of Visual Basic and Visual Basic .NET#More C-like syntax|+= and -= shorthand]] not found in classic Visual Basic.

It featured a major redesign of the interface, now with all forms and functions embedded in a single window, as well as some changes to the Gambas syntax, although for the most part code compatibility was kept. It featured major updates to existing Gambas components as well as the addition of some new ones, such as new components that could use [[GTK+]] or [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] for drawing or utilize [[OpenGL]] acceleration. Gambas 2.x versions can load up and run Gambas 1.x projects, with occasional incompatibilities; the same is true for Gambas 2.x to 3.x, but not from Gambas 1.x to 3.x.\n\nThe next major iteration of Gambas, the 3.x versions, was released on December 31, 2011.<ref name=\"TheH\">{{cite web | url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Gambas-3-0-for-BASIC-with-bug-and-security-fixes-1403082.html | title=Gambas 3.0 for BASIC with bug and security fixes | publisher=The H | accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> A 2015 benchmark published on the Gambas website showed Gambas 3.8.90 scripting as being faster to varying degrees than [[Perl]] 5.20.2 and the then-latest 2.7.10 version of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in many tests.<ref name=\"benchmark\">{{cite web | url=http://gambaswiki.org/wiki/doc/benchmark | title=Benchmarking | publisher=Gambas Website| accessdate=2018-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\n[[Image:Gambas-2.7.0-fedora-blackbox.png|200px|thumb|left|Gambas 2.7.0 running on [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Linux]] with [[Blackbox]]]]\nGambas is designed to build [[graphical user interface|graphical]] programs using the [[Qt (software)|Qt]] (currently Qt 4.x or 5.x) or the [[GTK+]] toolkit (GTK 3.x also supported as of 3.6.0); the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas.<ref name=\"penguinsightings-replace\">{{cite web |url=http://gambaswiki.org/wiki/doc/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions |website=Gambas Documentation |accessdate=2014-11-17}}</ref> Gambas includes a GUI designer to aid in creating user interfaces, but can also make [[Command-line interface|command line]] applications,<ref>[http://pclosmag.com/html/Issues/200810/page04.html An Alphabet of Computer Languages: BASIC], [[PCLinuxOS]] Magazine</ref> as well as [[text-based user interface]]s using the [[ncurses]] toolkit.<ref>[http://captainbodgit.blogspot.com/2017/03/gambas-cli-programming-ncurses-text.html Gambas cli programming: ncurses text based user interface]</ref> The Gambas [[Runtime system|runtime]] environment is needed to run executables.\n\nFunctionality is provided by a variety of components, each of which can be selected to provide additional features.<ref name=\"osnews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/8849/Regarding_Gambas/page1|first=Daniel |last=Fernandez|title=Regarding Gambas |date=2004-11-11 |publisher=OSNews |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref> Drawing can be provided either through Qt and GTK+ toolkits, with an additional component which is designed to switch between them.<ref name=\"linux.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://old.linux.co.uk//docs/center/featured-software/gambas-rad |title=Gambas RAD |publisher=Linux.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525123939/http://old.linux.co.uk/ |archive-date=2011-05-25 |df= }}</ref> Drawing can also be provided through the [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (originally version 1.x, with 2.x added as of 3.7.0)<ref name=\"sdl2\">{{cite web|url=http://git.net/gambas-development-environment-basic/msg17384.html |title=Why a new SDL component? |publisher=Gambas Mailing List |access-date=2015-02-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209211934/http://git.net/gambas-development-environment-basic/msg17384.html |archive-date=2015-02-09 |df= }}</ref>, which can also be utilized for audio playback through a separate sound component (a component for the [[OpenAL]] specification has also been added).

He also donated large sums of money to political causes. In 2020 he was convicted of bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGreg Lindberg was born in [[San Mateo, California]], United States in 1970, the youngest of five children. His father was an airline pilot. He attended [[Crystal Springs Uplands School]] in [[Hillsborough, California]] before studying at [[Yale University]], where he graduated with an economics degree in 1993.<ref name= lindberg>{{cite web| url = https://www.greglindberg.com/about/| title = Greg E. Lindberg: About| website = greglindberg.com| access-date = March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Global Growth ===\nIn 1991, while still attending Yale University, Lindberg launched ''Home Care Week'', a health insurance compliance and reimbursement newsletter for home health agencies.<ref name= lindberg/> He later transformed this venture into a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], [[Global Growth|Eli Global]], based in [[Durham, North Carolina]].<ref name=WSJ1>{{cite news| last = Maremont| first = Mark| last2 = Scism| first2 = Leslie| title = Insurance Tycoon Diverts $2 Billion| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| page = A1| date = March 1, 2019}}</ref> The conglomerate operated as an information and financial services company.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1313558D:US| title = Eli Global LLC| website = Bloomberg| access-date = March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Lindberg began investigating the possibility of acquiring insurance companies, displaying a particular interest in the large number of assets retained by such companies to fulfill payouts. In 2014 Eli Global made its first insurance acquisition when it purchased a burial-policy insurer based in Alabama. Lindberg wished to loan the insurer's assets to other businesses he owned, but the number of the company's assets he could invest in affiliated enterprises was restricted by Alabama state laws. Lindberg then relocated the insurer to North Carolina, where regulations on such practices were vaguer, and began trading the burial-policy insurer's investments in [[United States Treasury security|treasury bonds]] for large loans in his own companies. Though North Carolina regulators usually enforced a cap of affiliated investments on insurers at 10% of their assets, the North Carolina Department of Insurance led by [[North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance]] [[Wayne Goodwin]] reached a special agreement with Lindberg, allowing his burial-policy insurer to invest as much as 40% of its assets in affiliates, though this limit was also eventually breached. In 2015 and 2016 Lindberg acquired more insurers and grouped them together as the Global Bankers Insurance Group.<ref name=WSJ1/> As a result of the insurer acquisitions, Eli Global became markedly more profitable.<ref name= Eanes1/> Lindberg ultimately loaned about $2 billion from the insurance companies he had acquired to his affiliated corporations, using much of it to expand his private holdings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/financier-who-amassed-insurance-firms-diverted-2-billion-into-his-private-empire-11551367856|title=Financier Who Amassed Insurance Firms Diverted $2 Billion Into His Private Empire| last = Maremont| first = Mark| last2 = Scism| first2 = Leslie|date=January 3, 2019|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> By 2019 he had acquired over 100 companies.<ref name=WSJ1/> On June 27 the North Carolina Department of Insurance placed several of Lindberg's insurance companies into \"[[Receivership|rehabilitation]]\", citing concerns about their liquidity and ability to meet their obligations to policy holders.<ref>{{cite news| last = Maremont| first = Mark| last2 = Scism| first2 = Leslie| title = North Carolina Regulators Seize Control of Life Insurers Owned by Greg Lindberg| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-carolina-regulators-seize-control-of-life-insurers-owned-by-greg-lindberg-11561661303| date = June 27, 2019|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> Eli Global was re-branded as Global Growth in September 2019 and Lindberg resigned as its [[chief executive officer]].<ref>{{cite news| last = Ohnesorge  | first = Lauren| title = A new name, a new chairman for Lindberg-founded Eli Global| newspaper = Triangle Business Journal| date = September 18, 2019| url = https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2019/09/18/a-new-name-a-new-chairman-for-lindberg-founded-eli.html| access-date = March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Political donations ===\nLindberg is registered as an [[independent voter]].<ref name= AP>{{cite web| url = https://apnews.com/804e5a35b719d020689308b24c000432| title = Political corruption trial of big N Carolina donor to start| last = Robinson| first = Gary D.| date = February 15, 2020| publisher = [[Associated Press]]| access-date = March 16, 2020}}</ref> In February 2016 Lindberg made his first financial contribution to a political cause in North Carolina, donating to North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance Wayne Goodwin's reelection campaign.<ref name= Fain3/> That month he also hosted a fundraiser for Goodwin.<ref name=WSJ1/> Lindberg then began funding N.C.

He also donated large sums of money to political causes. In 2020 he was convicted of bribery and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGreg Lindberg was born in [[San Mateo, California]], United States in 1970, the youngest of five children. His father was an airline pilot. He attended [[Crystal Springs Uplands School]] in [[Hillsborough, California]] before studying at [[Yale University]], where he graduated with an economics degree in 1993.<ref name= lindberg>{{cite web| url = https://www.greglindberg.com/about/| title = Greg E. Lindberg: About| website = greglindberg.com| access-date = March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Global Growth ===\nIn 1991, while still attending Yale University, Lindberg launched ''Home Care Week'', a health insurance compliance and reimbursement newsletter for home health agencies.<ref name= lindberg/> He later transformed this venture into a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], [[Global Growth|Eli Global]], based in [[Durham, North Carolina]].<ref name=WSJ1>{{cite news| last = Maremont| first = Mark| last2 = Scism| first2 = Leslie| title = Insurance Tycoon Diverts $2 Billion| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| page = A1| date = March 1, 2019}}</ref> The conglomerate operated as an information and financial services company.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1313558D:US| title = Eli Global LLC| website = Bloomberg| access-date = March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Lindberg began investigating the possibility of acquiring insurance companies, displaying a particular interest in the large number of assets retained by such companies to fulfill payouts. In 2014 Eli Global made its first insurance acquisition when it purchased a burial-policy insurer based in Alabama. Lindberg wished to loan the insurer's assets to other businesses he owned, but the number of the company's assets he could invest in affiliated enterprises was restricted by Alabama state laws. Lindberg then relocated the insurer to North Carolina, where regulations on such practices were vaguer, and began trading the burial-policy insurer's investments in [[United States Treasury security|treasury bonds]] for large loans in his own companies. Though North Carolina regulators usually enforced a cap of affiliated investments on insurers at 10% of their assets, the North Carolina Department of Insurance led by [[North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance]] [[Wayne Goodwin]] reached a special agreement with Lindberg, allowing his burial-policy insurer to invest as much as 40% of its assets in affiliates, though this limit was also eventually breached. In 2015 and 2016 Lindberg acquired more insurers and grouped them together as the Global Bankers Insurance Group.<ref name=WSJ1/> As a result of the insurer acquisitions, Eli Global became markedly more profitable.<ref name= Eanes1/> Lindberg ultimately loaned about $2 billion from the insurance companies he had acquired to his affiliated corporations or himself, using much of it to expand his private holdings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/financier-who-amassed-insurance-firms-diverted-2-billion-into-his-private-empire-11551367856|title=Financier Who Amassed Insurance Firms Diverted $2 Billion Into His Private Empire| last = Maremont| first = Mark| last2 = Scism| first2 = Leslie|date=January 3, 2019|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> By 2019 he had acquired over 100 companies.<ref name=WSJ1/> On June 27 the North Carolina Department of Insurance placed several of Lindberg's insurance companies into \"[[Receivership|rehabilitation]]\", citing concerns about their liquidity and ability to meet their obligations to policy holders.<ref>{{cite news| last = Maremont| first = Mark| last2 = Scism| first2 = Leslie| title = North Carolina Regulators Seize Control of Life Insurers Owned by Greg Lindberg| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-carolina-regulators-seize-control-of-life-insurers-owned-by-greg-lindberg-11561661303| date = June 27, 2019|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> Eli Global was re-branded as Global Growth in September 2019 and Lindberg resigned as its [[chief executive officer]].<ref>{{cite news| last = Ohnesorge  | first = Lauren| title = A new name, a new chairman for Lindberg-founded Eli Global| newspaper = Triangle Business Journal| date = September 18, 2019| url = https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2019/09/18/a-new-name-a-new-chairman-for-lindberg-founded-eli.html| access-date = March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Political donations ===\nLindberg is registered as an [[independent voter]].<ref name= AP>{{cite web| url = https://apnews.com/804e5a35b719d020689308b24c000432| title = Political corruption trial of big N Carolina donor to start| last = Robinson| first = Gary D.| date = February 15, 2020| publisher = [[Associated Press]]| access-date = March 16, 2020}}</ref> In February 2016 Lindberg made his first financial contribution to a political cause in North Carolina, donating to North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance Wayne Goodwin's reelection campaign.<ref name= Fain3/> That month he also hosted a fundraiser for Goodwin.<ref name=WSJ1/> Lindberg then began funding N.C.
