It is said that the owner of the ranch, a wealthy widow named Estrella Diaz Miraflores, fell in love, or had an affair, with him, but when her brothers and the head of the local police (who was also in love with Miraflores) found out about their relationship, they accused him of robbery and tried to kill him. He enlisted in the army to escape from them, fighting against the [[Paraguayan army]]. When the war ended, he returned home and was welcomed as a hero.\n\nBut when he arrived at his village, he was forcibly recruited by the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados]] to return to the army and fight in the [[Argentine Civil Wars|Argentine Civil War]] against the Liberal parties.

He worked extensively on the oceanographic [[research]] vessels CSS Dawson and CSS Hudson (Canadian Scientific Ship, painted Survey Ship white, and run by the [[Bedford Institute of Oceanography]]), which today is the [[CCGS Hudson]].  His voyages included a portion of the first ever [[circumnavigation]] of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] by the [[CCGS Hudson|CSS Hudson]] in 1970, on which he was a watch keeper, not a scientist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.gc.ca/vessels-navires/ccgs-hudson-eng.htm |title=CCGS Hudson |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bio.gc.ca%2Fvessels-navires%2Fccgs-hudson-eng.htm&date=2009-09-12 |archivedate=12 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDavid Garner returned with his family to New Zealand in 1971, where he was a senior lecturer at the [[University of Auckland]] [http://www.auckland.ac.nz/] Physics Department [http://www.phy.auckland.ac.nz/] from approximately July 1971 to 1974, in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.

He worked extensively on the oceanographic [[research]] vessels CSS Dawson and CSS Hudson (Canadian Scientific Ship, painted Survey Ship white, and run by the [[Bedford Institute of Oceanography]]), which today is the [[CCGS Hudson]].

He is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, the American Physical Society and the Optical Society of America. He has published over 300 journal articles. He was the lead investigator for the Australian hardware contribution to the Advanced LIGO (USA) that, in September 2015, made the first direct observation of gravitational waves.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |author=Abbott, B.P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

Currently he is a professor at [[The Australian National University]] in the Research School of Physics and Engineering, in Canberra (Australia). He is Director of the ANU's Centre for Gravitational Physics and Deputy Director of OzGrav - the [[Australian Research Council]] Centre of Excellence in Gravitational Wave Discovery.\n\nDavid McClelland received his PhD degree from the [[University of Otago]], New Zealand, in 1987.  He was awarded a Beverly Research Fellowship before being appointed in 1988 to the Australian National University, as a Lecturer. Since 2001, he has been a professor at the ANU in the Research School of Physics and Engineering, in Canberra (Australia).\n\nIn 1990, at the ANU, he and his colleagues (H. Bachor, P. Manson, P. Fisk and D. Hope) demonstrated -0.8&nbsp;dB of optical squeezing at a few hundred mega Hertz using barium atoms [ref]. Over the years he establish the Centre for Gravitational Physics at the ANU, and build a rich and vibrant research group working on a squeezed light source in the audio-frequency band for future gravitational wave detectors.\n\nIn late 2003 with his graduate students they demonstrated squeezing down to a few hundred Hertz using nonlinear crystals.<ref>Squeezing in the Audio Gravitational-Wave Detection Band, Kirk McKenzie, Nicolai Grosse, Warwick P.
