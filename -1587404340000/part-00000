{"title_page": "Newspapers published in Nigeria", "text_new": "{{Use Nigerian English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n'''Newspapers published in Nigeria''' have a strong tradition of the principle of \"publish and be damned\" that dates  back to the colonial era when founding fathers of the Nigerian press such as [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], [[Ernest Ikoli]], [[Obafemi Awolowo]] and [[Lateef Jakande]] used their papers to fight for independence.{{sfn|Sriramesh||Ver\u010di\u010d|2009|pp=324}}\n\nUntil the 1990s, most publications were government-owned, but private papers such as the ''[[Media Trust|Daily Trust]]'', ''[[Nigerian Tribune]]'', ''[[The Punch]]'', ''[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]'', and the ''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|Guardian]]'' continued to expose public and private scandals despite government attempts at suppression.{{sfn|Sriramesh||Ver\u010di\u010d|2009|pp=324}}\n\nLaws related to the media, including newspapers, are scattered across various pieces of legislation. There are few good sources of discussion and analysis of these laws.{{sfn|Mwalimu|2005|pp=656}}\n\nSome Newspapers depend heavily on advertisements that may be placed by companies owned by powerful people. In some cases, this makes the papers cautious in reporting details of crimes or suspected crimes, and sometimes they carry [[Brown envelope journalism|articles that paint clearly corrupt individuals in a favourable light]].{{sfn|Okurounmu|2010|pp=107}} An analysis of newspapers shows a strong bias towards coverage of males, reflecting prevalent cultural biases. Few articles discuss women and there are few photographs of women outside the fashion sections.{{sfn|Poindexter|Meraz|2008|pp=220ff}}\nAlthough earnings have declined since the late 1980s the number of publications has steadily grown.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs of 2008 there were over 100 national, regional or local newspapers.{{sfn|Sriramesh||Ver\u010di\u010d|2009|pp=324}}\n\nOnline newspapers have become popular since the rise of internet accessibility in Nigeria; more than ten percent of the top fifty websites in the country are devoted to online newspapers. Due to improved mobile penetration and the growth of smartphones, Nigerians have begun to rely on the internet for news. Online newspapers have also been able to bypass government restrictions because content can be shared without the need for any physical infrastructure. The result has been a disruption of the traditional sources of news which have dominated the media industry. Recent online newspapers include ''[[Sahara Reporters]]'', ''[[Ripples Nigeria]]'' and ''[[Premium Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201607080930.html|title=Nigeria: Smartphone Penetration Hits 30 Percent in Nigeria|publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]]|date=8 July 2016|accessdate=21 March 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709144556/http://allafrica.com/stories/201607080930.html|archivedate=9 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==List of newspapers==\nThis is a '''list of newspapers in Nigeria'''.

Due to improved mobile penetration and the growth of smartphones, Nigerians have begun to rely on the internet for news. Online newspapers have also been able to bypass government restrictions because content can be shared without the need for any physical infrastructure. The result has been a disruption of the traditional sources of news which have dominated the media industry. Recent online newspapers include ''[[Sahara Reporters]]'', ''[[Ripples Nigeria]]'' and ''[[Premium Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201607080930.html|title=Nigeria: Smartphone Penetration Hits 30 Percent in Nigeria|publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]]|date=8 July 2016|accessdate=21 March 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709144556/http://allafrica.com/stories/201607080930.html|archivedate=9 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==List of newspapers==\nThis is a '''list of newspapers in Nigeria'''.

The Trials for men and women were held separately; men's events were held at [[Randall's Island Stadium]] in [[New York City]] on July 11 and July 12, while women competed at [[Brown Stadium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] on July 4. \nThe top three athletes in each event qualified for the Olympic Games. The women's meeting also served as the annual [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|outdoor track and field championships]] of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU); the men's AAU championships were held separately a week before the Olympic Trials.\n\nOfficial world records were set in the men's meet by [[Cornelius Johnson (athlete)|Cornelius Johnson]] and [[Dave Albritton]] in the high jump; [[Glenn Morris]]'s winning score in the decathlon was also a world record, but not ratified. [[Harold Manning]], winner of the 3000 meter steeplechase, set an unofficial world best. [[Jesse Owens]] won three events, equaling the world best for 200 meters around a curve.\n\nThe 1936 Olympic Trials were marked by the emergence of [[African-American]] athletes, including Owens, Johnson and Albritton; as many black athletes qualified for the men's team in 1936 as at all previous Olympic Trials combined.

Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually, she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]''; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but then tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and proceeded to dance the role all the way through before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique.

Wallis]] saw MacLaine's performance, and signed her to work for [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nMacLaine made her film debut in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), for which she won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress]]. This was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film ''[[Artists and Models]]'' (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had a role in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). This was followed by ''[[Hot Spell (film)|Hot Spell]]'' and a leading role in ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'' (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), starring with [[Jack Lemmon]]. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for [[Billy Wilder]]. She later said, \"I thought I would win for ''The Apartment'', but then, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had a tracheotomy.\" She starred in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961), also starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[James Garner]], based on the play by [[Lillian Hellman]], and directed by [[William Wyler]]. She was again nominated, this time for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon. [[Don Siegel]], her director on ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), said of her: \"It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine, and has too much balls. She's very, very hard.\"<ref>Patrick McGilligan, ''Clint: The Life and Legend'' (1999), p. 182</ref> At the peak of her success, she replaced [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964). Other films from this period include ''[[Gambit (1966 film)|Gambit]]'' (1966), with [[Michael Caine]], and the film version of the musical ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]'' (1968), based on the script for [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]'s ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' released a decade earlier.\n\n[[File:Shirley MacLaine - 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|In \"Shirley MacLaine \u2013 Live at the Palace Theatre\", 1976]]\nMacClaine was cast as a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] in a short-lived television sitcom, ''[[Shirley's World]]'' (1971\u20131972), co-produced by [[Sheldon Leonard]] and [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] and shot in the United Kingdom.

Uncrewed programs launched the first American artificial [[satellite]]s into Earth orbit for scientific and [[communications satellite|communications]] purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], and including \"[[Voyager program|grand tours]]\" of the outer planets. Crewed programs sent the first Americans into [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), won the [[Space Race]] with the [[Soviet Union]] by landing twelve men on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 in the [[Apollo program]], developed a semi-reusable LEO [[Space Shuttle]], and developed LEO [[space station]] capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet [[Russia]]. Some missions include both crewed and uncrewed aspects, such as the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]], which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent uncrewed to Jupiter.\n\n=== Crewed programs ===\nThe experimental [[rocket-powered aircraft]] programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for crewed spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man [[space capsule]] program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and [[national security|security]] fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the [[Soviet Union]], in 1961 President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the [[Apollo program]], and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a [[human mission to Mars]]. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital [[space station]] in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet [[Russia]].

Typically, the major directives had the intervention of the science advisory, political, funding, and public interest that synergized into various waves of effort often heavily swayed by technical, funding, and worldwide events. For example, there was a major push to build [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']] in the 1980s, but when the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Americans and other international partners came together to build the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn the 2010s, the major shift was the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket, the [[Space Launch System]]. Missions for the new System have varied but overall, they were similar as it primarily involved the desire to send a human into the space. The [[Space Exploration Initiative]] of the 1980s opened newer avenues of galaxy exploration.\n\nIn the coming decades, the focus is gradually shifting towards exploration of planet Mars; however, some differences exist over the technologies to develop and focus on for the exploration.<ref name=\"space.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|title=President Trump Directs NASA to Return to the Moon, Then Aim for Mars|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109040720/https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|archive-date=January 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the options considered was the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).<ref name=\"space.com\" /> ARM had largely been defunded in 2017, but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration, especially on a solar electric propulsion system.<ref name=\"defunded\">{{cite news |last1=Jeff Foust |title=NASA closing out Asteroid Redirect Mission |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-closing-out-asteroid-redirect-mission/ |accessdate=September 9, 2017 |work=Space News |date=June 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\nLonger project execution timelines means it is up to future officials to execute on a directive, which often leads to directional mismanagement. For example, a Shuttle replacement has numerous components involved, each making some headway before being called off for various reasons including the National Aerospace Plane, Venture Star, Orbital Space Plane, Ares I, and others. The asteroid mission was not a major directive in the 2010s. Instead, the general support rested with the long-term goal of getting humans to Mars. The Space Shuttle was retired and much of the existing road map was shelved including the then planned Lunar Return and Ares I human launch vehicle.\n\nPreviously, in the early 2000s, there was a plan called the [[Constellation Program]] but this was defunded in the early 2010s.<ref name=\"BBC cancels Moon return\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Obama cancels Moon return project|work=BBC News|date=February 1, 2010|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821102845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|archive-date=August 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FY2011_budget\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Terminations, Reductions, and Savings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811185822/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|archivedate=August 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"WashPost eliminates funds\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|title=NASA budget for 2011 eliminates funds for manned lunar missions|work=Washington Post|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|first=Joel|last=Achenbach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321220708/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|archive-date=March 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Estimates|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201191410/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|archivedate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> In the 1990s, there was a plan called \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120031500/http://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |archive-date=January 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the 1980s, there was a directive to build a crewed space station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|title=Reagan ISS|first=Todd Messer, Claire Rojstaczer, and Steve|last=Garber|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231131/https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== NASA Authorization Act of 2017 ===\n[[File:Orion ISS 1 (05-2007).jpg|thumb|Orion at ISS artwork]]\n\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2017, which included $19.5 billion in funding for that fiscal year, directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|title=US Government Issues NASA Demand, 'Get Humans to Mars By 2033'|date=March 9, 2017|work=Futurism|access-date=February 16, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082516/https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|archive-date=February 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.<ref name=\":00\" />\n\n=== Space Policy Directive 1 ===\nIn December 2017, on the 45th anniversary of the last crewed mission to the Lunar surface, President [[Donald Trump]] approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to Mars and beyond.<ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\n{{quote|We'll learn.

Some missions include both crewed and uncrewed aspects, such as the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]], which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent uncrewed to Jupiter.\n\n=== Crewed programs ===\nThe experimental [[rocket-powered aircraft]] programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for crewed spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man [[space capsule]] program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and [[national security|security]] fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the [[Soviet Union]], in 1961 President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the [[Apollo program]], and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a [[human mission to Mars]]. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital [[space station]] in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet [[Russia]]. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 crewed space missions on rockets, and thirteen [[X-15]] rocket flights above the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] definition of spaceflight altitude, {{convert|80|km|ft|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref>The Air Force definition of outer space differs from that of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|International Aeronautical Federation]], which is {{convert|100|km|ft|sp=us}}.</ref>\n\n==== X-15 rocket plane (1959\u20131968) ====\n{{main|North American X-15}}\n[[File:X-15 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 in powered flight]]\n\nThe [[North American X-15]] was an NACA experimental rocket-powered [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy.

Typically, the major directives had the intervention of the science advisory, political, funding, and public interest that synergized into various waves of effort often heavily swayed by technical, funding, and worldwide events. For example, there was a major push to build [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']] in the 1980s, but when the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Americans and other international partners came together to build the [[International Space Station]].\n\nIn the 2010s, the major shift was the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket, the [[Space Launch System]]. Missions for the new System have varied but overall, they were similar as it primarily involved the desire to send a human into the space. The [[Space Exploration Initiative]] of the 1980s opened newer avenues of galaxy exploration.\n\nIn the coming decades, the focus is gradually shifting towards exploration of planet Mars; however, some differences exist over the technologies to develop and focus on for the exploration.<ref name=\"space.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|title=President Trump Directs NASA to Return to the Moon, Then Aim for Mars|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109040720/https://www.space.com/39050-trump-directs-nasa-humans-to-moon.html|archive-date=January 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the options considered was the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).<ref name=\"space.com\" /> ARM had largely been defunded in 2017, but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration, especially on a solar electric propulsion system.<ref name=\"defunded\">{{cite news |last1=Jeff Foust |title=NASA closing out Asteroid Redirect Mission |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-closing-out-asteroid-redirect-mission/ |accessdate=September 9, 2017 |work=Space News |date=June 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\nLonger project execution timelines means it is up to future officials to execute on a directive, which often leads to directional mismanagement. For example, a Shuttle replacement has numerous components involved, each making some headway before being called off for various reasons including the National Aerospace Plane, Venture Star, Orbital Space Plane, Ares I, and others. The asteroid mission was not a major directive in the 2010s. Instead, the general support rested with the long-term goal of getting humans to Mars. The Space Shuttle was retired and much of the existing road map was shelved including the then planned Lunar Return and Ares I human launch vehicle.\n\nPreviously, in the early 2000s, there was a plan called the [[Constellation Program]] but this was defunded in the early 2010s.<ref name=\"BBC cancels Moon return\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Obama cancels Moon return project|work=BBC News|date=February 1, 2010|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821102845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8489097.stm|archive-date=August 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FY2011_budget\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Terminations, Reductions, and Savings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811185822/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf|archivedate=August 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"WashPost eliminates funds\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|title=NASA budget for 2011 eliminates funds for manned lunar missions|work=Washington Post|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|first=Joel|last=Achenbach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321220708/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|archive-date=March 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|accessdate=March 7, 2010|title=Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Estimates|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201191410/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf|archivedate=February 1, 2010}}</ref> In the 1990s, there was a plan called \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120031500/http://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/misc/fbctask.pdf |archive-date=January 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the 1980s, there was a directive to build a crewed space station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|title=Reagan ISS|first=Todd Messer, Claire Rojstaczer, and Steve|last=Garber|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231131/https://history.nasa.gov/reagan84.htm|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== NASA Authorization Act of 2017 ===\n[[File:Orion ISS 1 (05-2007).jpg|thumb|Orion at ISS artwork]]\n\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2017, which included $19.5 billion in funding for that fiscal year, directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|title=US Government Issues NASA Demand, 'Get Humans to Mars By 2033'|date=March 9, 2017|work=Futurism|access-date=February 16, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082516/https://futurism.com/us-government-issues-nasa-demand-get-humans-to-mars-by-2033/|archive-date=February 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.<ref name=\":00\" />\n\n=== Space Policy Directive 1 ===\nIn December 2017, on the 45th anniversary of the last crewed mission to the Lunar surface, President [[Donald Trump]] approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to Mars and beyond.<ref name=\"space.com\" />\n\n{{quote|We'll learn.

The other operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]] (which can be viewed as the inverse of division).

Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called [[Euclidean domain]]s and include [[polynomial ring]]s in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[division ring]]s. In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] the elements by which division is always possible are called the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] (for example, 1 and \u20131 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the [[quotient group]], in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number.\n\n6\u00f72(1+2)=9\nIt will always equal 9.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of [[quotition and partition]]: from the quotition perspective, {{math|20&nbsp;/&nbsp;5}} means the number of 5s that must be added to get&nbsp;20. In terms of partition, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into four groups of five apples, meaning that ''twenty divided by five is equal to four''. This is denoted as {{math|1=20 / 5 = 4}} or {{math|20 \u00f7 5 {{=}} 4}}, or {{math|1={{sfrac|20|5}} = 4}}.<ref name=\"mwdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=Division|title=Division}}</ref> What is being divided is called the ''dividend'', which is divided by the ''divisor'', and the result is called the ''quotient''. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\n\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a [[remainder]] that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, {{math|10 / 3}} (or {{math|10 \u00f7 3}}) leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a [[fractional part]], so {{math|10 / 3}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|3|1|3}}}} or {{math|3.33...}}, but in the context of [[integer]] division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately (exceptionally, discarded or [[rounding|rounded]]).<ref name=\"mwintdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=IntegerDivision|title=Integer Division}}</ref> When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a [[rational number]].

An [[obelus]] used as a variant of the minus sign in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called \u00abN\u00e6ringsoppgave 1\u00bb for the taxation year 2010.]]\nDivision is often shown in algebra and science by placing the ''dividend'' over the ''divisor'' with a horizontal line, also called a [[fraction bar]], between them. For example, \"''a'' divided by ''b\"'' can written as:\n:<math>\\frac ab</math>\n\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"divide ''a'' by ''b''\" or\"''a'' over ''b''\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'' (or numerator), then a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], then the ''divisor'' (or denominator), as follows:\n:<math>a/b</math>\n\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer [[programming language]]s, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of [[ASCII]] characters. Some [[mathematical software]], such as [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the [[backslash]] as the division operator:\n:<math>b\\backslash a</math>\n\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (fraction slash) but elevates the dividend, and lowers the divisor:\n:<math>{}^{a}/{}_{b}</math>\n\nAny of these forms can be used to display a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are [[integer]]s (typically called the ''numerator'' and ''denominator''), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the [[division sign]](\u00f7, also known as [[obelus]] though the term has additional meanings), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\n:<math>a \\div b</math>\n\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. [[ISO 80000-2]]-9.6 states it should not be used. This division sign is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a [[calculator]]. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Rahn]] in 1659 in ''Teutsche Algebra''.<ref name=\"Cajori\">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|url=https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002|publisher=Open Court Pub.

Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of '[[Chunking (division)|chunking]]'{{snd}} a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. \n\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2013 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621042203/https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|archive-date=2019-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMore systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the [[multiplication tables]] can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of [[short division]], if the divisor is small, or [[long division]], if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (expressed as a [[decimal fraction]]), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction.\n\nA person can calculate division with an [[abacus]] by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|title=How to Do Division on the Abacus in Easy Steps|website=Owlcation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624204231/https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|archive-date=2019-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA person can use [[logarithm tables]] to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\n\nA person can calculate division with a [[slide rule]] by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\n\n===By computer or with computer assistance===\nModern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For [[division with remainder]], see [[Division algorithm]].\n\nIn [[modular arithmetic]] (modulo a prime number) and for [[real numbers]], nonzero numbers have a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]]. In these cases, a division by {{mvar|x}} may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of {{mvar|x}}. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\n\n==Division in different contexts==\n=== Euclidean division ===\n{{main|Euclidean division}}\nThe Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, ''a'', the ''dividend'', and ''b'', the ''divisor'', such that ''b'' \u2260 0, there are [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]] integers ''q'', the ''quotient'', and ''r'', the remainder,  such that ''a'' = ''bq'' + ''r'' and 0 \u2264 ''r'' < {{abs|''b''}}, where {{abs|''b''}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of ''b''.\n\n=== Of integers ===\nIntegers are not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give an approximate answer as a [[decimal fraction]] or a [[mixed number]], so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2.36</math> or <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2 \\tfrac {36}{100}.</math> This is the approach usually taken in [[numerical computation]].\n# Give the answer as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] representing a [[rational number]], so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}.</math> But, usually, the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}</math>. This simplification may be done by factoring out the [[greatest common divisor]].\n# Give the answer as an integer ''[[quotient]]'' and a ''[[remainder]]'', so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\mbox{ remainder } 4.</math> To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called ''[[Euclidean division]]'', because it is the basis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n# Give the integer quotient as the answer, so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2.</math> This is sometimes called ''integer division''.\nDividing integers in a [[computer program]] requires special care. Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as [[MATLAB]] and every [[computer algebra system]] return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\n\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward [[Extended real number line|\u2212\u221e]] (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see [[Modulo operation]] for the details.\n\n[[Divisibility rule]]s can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\n\n=== Of rational numbers ===\nThe result of dividing two [[rational number]]s is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' can be computed as\n:<math>{p/q \\over r/s} = {p \\over q} \\times {s \\over r} = {ps \\over qr}.</math>\n\nAll four quantities are integers, and only ''p'' may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of [[multiplication]].\n\n=== Of real numbers ===\nDivision of two [[real number]]s results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that ''a''/''b'' = ''c'' if and only if ''a'' = ''cb'' and ''b'' \u2260 0.\n\n=== Of complex numbers ===\nDividing two [[complex number]]s (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\n:<math>{p+iq \\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\over r^2+s^2}.</math>\n\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by <math>r-is</math> is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]. All four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' and ''s'' may not both be 0.\n\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\n:<math>{p e^{iq} \\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. </math>\n\nAgain all four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' may not be 0.\n\n=== Of polynomials ===\nOne can define the division operation for [[polynomial]]s in one variable over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See [[Euclidean division of polynomials]], and, for hand-written computation, [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].\n\n=== Of matrices ===\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, where {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} denotes the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of ''B'', but it is far more common to write out {{nowrap|''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} explicitly to avoid confusion. An [[elementwise division]] can also be defined in terms of the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]].\n\n==== Left and right division ====\nBecause [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[commutative]], one can also define a [[left division]] or so-called ''backslash-division'' as {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''B''}}. For this to be well defined, {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} need not exist, however {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is sometimes called ''right division'' or ''slash-division'' in this context.\n\nNote that with left and right division defined this way, {{nowrap|''A'' / (''BC'')}} is in general not the same as {{nowrap|(''A'' / ''B'') / ''C''}}, nor is {{nowrap|(''AB'') \\ ''C''}} the same as {{nowrap|''A'' \\ (''B'' \\ ''C'')}}. However, it holds that {{nowrap|1=''A'' / (''BC'') = (''A'' / ''C'') / ''B''}} and {{nowrap|1=(''AB'') \\ ''C'' = ''B'' \\ (''A'' \\ ''C'')}}.\n\n==== Pseudoinverse ====\nTo avoid problems when {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} and/or {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the [[Generalized inverse|pseudoinverse]]. That is, {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''B''}}, where {{nowrap|''A''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''B''<sup>+</sup>}} denote the pseudoinverses of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n=== Abstract algebra ===\nIn [[abstract algebra]], given a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}) is typically defined as the solution ''x'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2217 ''x'' = ''b''}}, if this exists and is unique.  Similarly, right division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}) is the solution ''y'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''b''}}.  Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).\n\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the [[cancellation property]].  Examples include [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebras and [[quaternion]] algebras.  A [[quasigroup]] is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses.  In an [[integral domain]], where not every element need have an inverse, ''division'' by a cancellative element ''a'' can still be performed on elements of the form ''ab'' or ''ca'' by left or right cancellation, respectively.  If a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]], every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and ''division'' by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when ''algebras'' (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on [[division algebra]]s. In particular [[Bott periodicity]] can be used to show that any [[real number|real]] [[normed division algebra]] must be [[isomorphic]] to either the real numbers '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', or the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.\n<!-- Left vs right, definition of quasigroup, relationship to inverse elements in presence of associativity, examples: groups, octonions -->\n\n=== Calculus ===\nThe [[derivative]] of the quotient of two functions is given by the [[quotient rule]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\frac fg\\right)}' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.</math>\n\n== Division by zero ==\n{{main|Division by zero}}\nDivision of any number by [[zero]] in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a [[multiplication|product]] of zero.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234325/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html |date=2018-10-23 }} Retrieved October 23 2018</ref> Entry of such an expression into most [[calculator]]s produces an error message.

In these enlarged [[number system]]s, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''c'' / ''b''}} means {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''c''}}, as long as {{math|''b''}} is not zero.

Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called [[Euclidean domain]]s and include [[polynomial ring]]s in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[division ring]]s. In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] the elements by which division is always possible are called the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] (for example, 1 and \u20131 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the [[quotient group]], in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of [[quotition and partition]]: from the quotition perspective, {{math|20&nbsp;/&nbsp;5}} means the number of 5s that must be added to get&nbsp;20. In terms of partition, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into four groups of five apples, meaning that ''twenty divided by five is equal to four''. This is denoted as {{math|1=20 / 5 = 4}} or {{math|20 \u00f7 5 {{=}} 4}}, or {{math|1={{sfrac|20|5}} = 4}}.<ref name=\"mwdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=Division|title=Division}}</ref> What is being divided is called the ''dividend'', which is divided by the ''divisor'', and the result is called the ''quotient''. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\n\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a [[remainder]] that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, {{math|10 / 3}} (or {{math|10 \u00f7 3}}) leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a [[fractional part]], so {{math|10 / 3}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|3|1|3}}}} or {{math|3.33...}}, but in the context of [[integer]] division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately (exceptionally, discarded or [[rounding|rounded]]).<ref name=\"mwintdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=IntegerDivision|title=Integer Division}}</ref> When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a [[rational number]].

An [[obelus]] used as a variant of the minus sign in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called \u00abN\u00e6ringsoppgave 1\u00bb for the taxation year 2010.]]\nDivision is often shown in algebra and science by placing the ''dividend'' over the ''divisor'' with a horizontal line, also called a [[fraction bar]], between them. For example, \"''a'' divided by ''b\"'' can written as:\n:<math>\\frac ab</math>\n\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"divide ''a'' by ''b''\" or\"''a'' over ''b''\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'' (or numerator), then a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], then the ''divisor'' (or denominator), as follows:\n:<math>a/b</math>\n\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer [[programming language]]s, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of [[ASCII]] characters. Some [[mathematical software]], such as [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the [[backslash]] as the division operator:\n:<math>b\\backslash a</math>\n\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (fraction slash) but elevates the dividend, and lowers the divisor:\n:<math>{}^{a}/{}_{b}</math>\n\nAny of these forms can be used to display a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are [[integer]]s (typically called the ''numerator'' and ''denominator''), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the [[division sign]](\u00f7, also known as [[obelus]] though the term has additional meanings), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\n:<math>a \\div b</math>\n\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. [[ISO 80000-2]]-9.6 states it should not be used. This division sign is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a [[calculator]]. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Rahn]] in 1659 in ''Teutsche Algebra''.<ref name=\"Cajori\">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|url=https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002|publisher=Open Court Pub.

Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of '[[Chunking (division)|chunking]]'{{snd}} a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. \n\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2013 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621042203/https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|archive-date=2019-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMore systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the [[multiplication tables]] can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of [[short division]], if the divisor is small, or [[long division]], if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (expressed as a [[decimal fraction]]), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction.\n\nA person can calculate division with an [[abacus]] by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|title=How to Do Division on the Abacus in Easy Steps|website=Owlcation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624204231/https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|archive-date=2019-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA person can use [[logarithm tables]] to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\n\nA person can calculate division with a [[slide rule]] by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\n\n===By computer or with computer assistance===\nModern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For [[division with remainder]], see [[Division algorithm]].\n\nIn [[modular arithmetic]] (modulo a prime number) and for [[real numbers]], nonzero numbers have a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]]. In these cases, a division by {{mvar|x}} may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of {{mvar|x}}. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\n\n==Division in different contexts==\n=== Euclidean division ===\n{{main|Euclidean division}}\nThe Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, ''a'', the ''dividend'', and ''b'', the ''divisor'', such that ''b'' \u2260 0, there are [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]] integers ''q'', the ''quotient'', and ''r'', the remainder,  such that ''a'' = ''bq'' + ''r'' and 0 \u2264 ''r'' < {{abs|''b''}}, where {{abs|''b''}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of ''b''.\n\n=== Of integers ===\nIntegers are not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give an approximate answer as a [[decimal fraction]] or a [[mixed number]], so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2.36</math> or <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2 \\tfrac {36}{100}.</math> This is the approach usually taken in [[numerical computation]].\n# Give the answer as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] representing a [[rational number]], so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}.</math> But, usually, the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}</math>. This simplification may be done by factoring out the [[greatest common divisor]].\n# Give the answer as an integer ''[[quotient]]'' and a ''[[remainder]]'', so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\mbox{ remainder } 4.</math> To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called ''[[Euclidean division]]'', because it is the basis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n# Give the integer quotient as the answer, so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2.</math> This is sometimes called ''integer division''.\nDividing integers in a [[computer program]] requires special care. Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as [[MATLAB]] and every [[computer algebra system]] return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\n\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward [[Extended real number line|\u2212\u221e]] (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see [[Modulo operation]] for the details.\n\n[[Divisibility rule]]s can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\n\n=== Of rational numbers ===\nThe result of dividing two [[rational number]]s is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' can be computed as\n:<math>{p/q \\over r/s} = {p \\over q} \\times {s \\over r} = {ps \\over qr}.</math>\n\nAll four quantities are integers, and only ''p'' may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of [[multiplication]].\n\n=== Of real numbers ===\nDivision of two [[real number]]s results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that ''a''/''b'' = ''c'' if and only if ''a'' = ''cb'' and ''b'' \u2260 0.\n\n=== Of complex numbers ===\nDividing two [[complex number]]s (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\n:<math>{p+iq \\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\over r^2+s^2}.</math>\n\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by <math>r-is</math> is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]. All four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' and ''s'' may not both be 0.\n\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\n:<math>{p e^{iq} \\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. </math>\n\nAgain all four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' may not be 0.\n\n=== Of polynomials ===\nOne can define the division operation for [[polynomial]]s in one variable over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See [[Euclidean division of polynomials]], and, for hand-written computation, [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].\n\n=== Of matrices ===\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, where {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} denotes the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of ''B'', but it is far more common to write out {{nowrap|''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} explicitly to avoid confusion. An [[elementwise division]] can also be defined in terms of the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]].\n\n==== Left and right division ====\nBecause [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[commutative]], one can also define a [[left division]] or so-called ''backslash-division'' as {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''B''}}. For this to be well defined, {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} need not exist, however {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is sometimes called ''right division'' or ''slash-division'' in this context.\n\nNote that with left and right division defined this way, {{nowrap|''A'' / (''BC'')}} is in general not the same as {{nowrap|(''A'' / ''B'') / ''C''}}, nor is {{nowrap|(''AB'') \\ ''C''}} the same as {{nowrap|''A'' \\ (''B'' \\ ''C'')}}. However, it holds that {{nowrap|1=''A'' / (''BC'') = (''A'' / ''C'') / ''B''}} and {{nowrap|1=(''AB'') \\ ''C'' = ''B'' \\ (''A'' \\ ''C'')}}.\n\n==== Pseudoinverse ====\nTo avoid problems when {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} and/or {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the [[Generalized inverse|pseudoinverse]]. That is, {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''B''}}, where {{nowrap|''A''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''B''<sup>+</sup>}} denote the pseudoinverses of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n=== Abstract algebra ===\nIn [[abstract algebra]], given a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}) is typically defined as the solution ''x'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2217 ''x'' = ''b''}}, if this exists and is unique.  Similarly, right division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}) is the solution ''y'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''b''}}.  Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).\n\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the [[cancellation property]].  Examples include [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebras and [[quaternion]] algebras.  A [[quasigroup]] is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses.  In an [[integral domain]], where not every element need have an inverse, ''division'' by a cancellative element ''a'' can still be performed on elements of the form ''ab'' or ''ca'' by left or right cancellation, respectively.  If a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]], every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and ''division'' by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when ''algebras'' (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on [[division algebra]]s. In particular [[Bott periodicity]] can be used to show that any [[real number|real]] [[normed division algebra]] must be [[isomorphic]] to either the real numbers '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', or the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.\n<!-- Left vs right, definition of quasigroup, relationship to inverse elements in presence of associativity, examples: groups, octonions -->\n\n=== Calculus ===\nThe [[derivative]] of the quotient of two functions is given by the [[quotient rule]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\frac fg\\right)}' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.</math>\n\n== Division by zero ==\n{{main|Division by zero}}\nDivision of any number by [[zero]] in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a [[multiplication|product]] of zero.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234325/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html |date=2018-10-23 }} Retrieved October 23 2018</ref> Entry of such an expression into most [[calculator]]s produces an error message.

In 2004, ACNielsen chose the [[CipherLab]] CPT-8001 as its data collection terminal for the Homescan program throughout [[Asia]].<ref>[http://www.itreselleronline.com/article.mvc/CPT-8001-Preferred-Terminal-For-AC-Nielsen-As-0001?VNETCOOKIE=NO \"CPT-8001 Preferred Terminal For AC Nielsen (Asia Pacific)\"] IT Reseller Online, 2004-10-28</ref>\n\n== International ==\nIn [[Germany]], ACNielsen gained reputation for their introduction of the Nielsen areas (or ''Nielsengebiete'' in German), each of which includes one or more German federal states sharing a similar economic structure, culture, and consumer behaviour. Marketing strategies in Germany depend considerably on the Nielsengebiete, to the extent that some trademarks or marketing campaigns have only been introduced in some of the Nielsengebiete. In many newspapers and magazines disseminated nationwide, advertisements may be placed for just one or some Nielsengebiete; the circulation figures of print media are often stated according to Nielsengebiete as well. {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Mergers and acquisitions ==\nIn 2001, ACNielsen itself was acquired by [[Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen|VNU]], as part of VNU's Marketing Information group, and thus is now under the same corporate umbrella as the company it spawned, NMR.

Panel members carry an electronic monitor that detects the digital station and program identification codes hidden within the TV and radio broadcasts they are exposed to. At night, members place the monitor in a cradle that sends the collected data through the home's electrical wiring to a relay device that transmits it by phone, making it one of the first practical uses of electrical wiring as a [[home network]].

Nielsen Sr.]] in order to give marketers reliable and objective information on the impact of [[marketing]] and sales programs.  ACNielsen began expanding internationally in 1939, and now operates in more than 100 countries.\n\n== Activities ==\nOne of Nielsen's best known creations is the [[Nielsen ratings]], an [[Audience measurement]] system that measures television, radio and newspaper audiences in their respective [[media market]]s. In 1950, they acquired the [[C. E. Hooper]] company and began attaching recording devices to a statistical sample of about 1,200 consumer television sets in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924209,00.html|title=Milestones, Jun. 16, 1980|author=|date=16 June 1980|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}</ref> These devices used photographic film in mail-in cartridges to record the channels viewed by the consumer and thus determine audience size. Later they developed electronic methods of data collection and transmission. In 1996, Nielsen split off this part of its operations into a separate company called [[Nielsen Media Research]] (NMR), which operated as an independent company until it was acquired by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen|VNU]] in 1999.
