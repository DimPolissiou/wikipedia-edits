In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative.

He played in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[New York Rangers]], [[St. Louis Blues]], [[New Jersey Devils]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Florida Panthers]], and the [[Washington Capitals]], and won the [[Stanley Cup]] five times in his career, including in [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|1985]], [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987]], [[1988 Stanley Cup Finals|1988]], [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals|1990]] with the Oilers, and [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] with the Rangers.\n\n==Background and early career==\nEsa Tikkanen began his career in hockey as a little boy by being a mascot for [[Jokerit]], a team based in Helsinki, Finland, and playing for the Jokerit junior team. After spending a year in Canada in 1981\u201382 with the [[Regina Blues]] of the [[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]] and [[Regina Pats]] of the [[Western Hockey League]], Tikkanen returned to Finland and signed with HJK and after a set of impressive performances signed a contract with Finland's leading team, [[HIFK (ice hockey)|HIFK]]. Tikkanen was drafted in the fourth round (80th overall) by the Oilers in the 1983 [[NHL Entry Draft]]. In 1984\u201385, he played 36 games for HIFK in the Finnish SM-liiga before joining the Oilers for their 1985 playoff run. He played briefly in the [[American Hockey League]] for the Oilers' affiliate the [[Nova Scotia Oilers]] in [[1985\u201386 AHL season|1985\u201386]], before joining the team full-time.\n\n==NHL playing career==\n\n===Start in Edmonton===\nIn his early twenties Tikkanen began his pro career in big leagues while additionally working as a coach in [[South Korea]]. Tikkanen made his NHL debut with the [[Edmonton Oilers]] during the second game of the [[1985 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. By playing one game in the [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|finals that year]], he was eligible to have his name engraved on the [[Stanley Cup]] even before playing his first regular-season game in the NHL. He soon became an important part of the Oilers, playing on the team's first line with [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Jari Kurri]]. Kurri and Gretzky's roles were to score goals; Tikkanen was the line's defensive player. Oilers coach and general manager [[Glen Sather]] once suggested that Tikkanen should be awarded the [[Frank J. Selke trophy]] (the award for the best defensive forward in the NHL). He was a finalist several times in his career, but never won the award. Tikkanen excelled at distracting and confusing opponents with his [[#Tikkanese|Tiki-Talk]]. Between 1986 and 1990, Tikkanen scored 30 or more goals three times and was on three more Cup champions. In 1991, he led the Edmonton Oilers in points in the regular season with 69 points.\n\n===Time after Oilers===\nIn March 1993, Tikkanen was traded to the [[New York Rangers]] for [[Doug Weight]], and he was part of that team's [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994 Stanley Cup victory]], scoring 22 goals and 54 points in 83 regular-season games. In July 1994, Tikkanen was traded with [[Doug Lidster]] to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for [[Petr Nedv\u011bd]].\n\nThe start of the NHL's 1994\u201395 season was delayed by a lockout, during which Tikkanen returned to Finland to play for [[HIFK|HIFK Helsinki]]. After the lockout Tikkanen, played with the Blues during the shortened 1995 season, and appeared in 11 games in 1995-96 before a trade sent him to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Three weeks later he was again dealt, this time to the [[Vancouver Canucks]].\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season saw him involved in yet another midseason trade, back to the Rangers, in March. Although he contributed only one goal in 14 regular-season games with New York, he came alive in the playoffs, scoring 9 times in 15 games. Of the Rangers, only Gretzky, with 10, outscored Tikkanen. The Rangers eliminated the [[Florida Panthers]] and New Jersey Devils before falling to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe 32-year-old Tikkanen became a free agent in the summer of 1997, and he signed with the Panthers, but this would also prove to be a short stay. By March 1998 he had appeared in only 28 games, and Florida traded him to the [[Washington Capitals]] for [[Dwayne Hay]]. He appeared in all 21 of Washington's playoff games, as the Capitals went to the Stanley Cup finals, where they were swept in four straight games by the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Tikkanen is remembered for missing a wide-open shot on goal that would have iced Game 2, which has been described as a turning point of the Series.<ref name=wpost4292013>{{cite news|last=Svrluga|first=Barry|title=Washington Capitals coaches are direct link to team's run to 1998 Stanley Cup finals|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-coaches-are-direct-link-to-teams-run-to-1998-stanley-cup-finals/2013/04/29/2477b950-ac56-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story_3.html|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=29 April 2013}}</ref> This was to be Tikkanen's last full season in the NHL. After becoming a free agent prior to the 1998\u201399 season, he signed for a third stint with the Rangers. However, he only played in 32 games before an injury sidelined him for the rest of the season.\n\nBefore the start of the [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]] season, Tikkanen attended the Oilers' training camp and was offered a role of playing coach in the minors. Tikkanen declined the offer and returned to Finland, where he played a full season with Helsinki's second team, [[Jokerit]]. In 877 NHL games, he had scored 244 goals and 386 assists for 630 points, while racking up 1,077 minutes in penalties. In 186 Stanley Cup playoff games, he scored 72 goals and 60 assists for 132 points, with 275 penalty minutes.\n\n===Post NHL career===\nIn 1999\u20132000, Tikkanen played a season with Helsinki-based team [[Jokerit]], a rival team of HIFK, with whom Tikkanen had played earlier in his career. Jokerit finished in second place in the SM-Liiga. In 2000\u201301, Tikkanen moved to [[Germany]], where he played what was to be his last season in a recognized professional league for [[Moskitos Essen]] of the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]]. He retired in 2001.\n\nDuring the 2004\u201305 season, Tikkanen resurfaced again, this time as a player-coach for the [[Anyang Halla]], a [[South Korea]]n team in the [[Asia League Ice Hockey]].<ref name=\"ABCNews\">{{Cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=419077 |title = Sports}}</ref> Though he predicted that he and his two linemates would finish 1-2-3 in scoring,<ref name=\"Points123\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.asahi.com/english/sports/TKY200411260123.html |title = The Asahi Shimbun}}</ref> he finished tied for fourth on his team, with 8 goals and 17 assists for 25 points in 30 games. He was 29th in the league in assists, and didn't crack the top 30 in goals or points. He did, however, lead Halla in penalty minutes with 58 (tied for 28th in the league). Halla finished fifth in the league and did not make the playoffs.\n\nAfter one season in Korea, Tikkanen became the coach for [[Frisk Tigers]] of the Norwegian [[GET-ligaen]]. Tikkanen was head coach only for the [[2005\u201306 UPC-ligaen season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nOn 27 December 2010 [[Jokipojat]] from [[Joensuu]], Finland, announced that Tikkanen would be the head coach of the team for the rest of the 2010\u20132011 season. Jokipojat plays in [[Mestis]], which is the second-highest league in Finland.\n\n==International play==\n{{MedalTableTop|}}\n{{MedalCountry | {{flagicon|Finland}} [[Finland]] }}\n{{MedalSport | Men's [[ice hockey]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Olympic Games]]}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano]]|[[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Ice hockey]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]]}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2000 Russia]]|Ice hockey}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]]}}\n{{MedalSilver| [[1984 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1984 Sweden]]|Ice hockey}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\n\nEsa Tikkanen played 81 games for [[Finland national men's ice hockey team|Finnish National team]].\n\nTikkanen participated in two Canada Cups, 5 World Championship tournaments and the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\n==Notable achievements==\nTikkanen won the Stanley Cup four times as a member of the Oilers and once more as a member of the Rangers. His various acquisitions were by teams craving him for his playoff experience and success: in 877 regular season games he scored 244 goals, but in 186 playoff games he scored 72 goals which puts him 14th all time in NHL playoff scoring, and 38th all time in play-offs points with 132points. \"Tik\" was known for his ability to score clutch goals, but also for his general style of play\u2014chippy and aggressive. He was nicknamed \"The Grate One\" (a pun on teammate Gretzky's moniker \"The Great One\") for his ability to irritate opposing players, often just by talking to them in his Finnish-English \"Tikkanese\" or \"Tiki-Talk.\" His regular-season totals were 244 goals, 386 assists, and 1077 penalty minutes. In the playoffs, he added 72 goals, 60 assists, and 275 penalty minutes. Tikkanen also led the Edmonton Oilers with 69 points in the 1990-91 regular season. Tikkanen holds the NHL record for scoring two shorthanded goals in the shortest time (10 seconds apart). With 436 points and 178 goals as a member of Edmonton Oilers, he is rank 10th in points and 8th in goals in Edmonton Oilers all-time scoring leader. He's also 6th in Edmonton all-time scoring leader in team play-offs with 97 points, and 5th in goals with 51. He is also tied 20th all-time regular season short-handed goals leader with 29. He is also tied 4th all-time in play-offs overtime goals leader with 4 goals.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the Trailer Park Boys:Out of the Park in 2016.\n\nIn the 2009 book ''100 Ranger Greats'', the authors ranked Tikkanen at No. 85 all-time of the [[List of New York Rangers players|901 New York Rangers]] who had played during the team's first [[2008\u201309 New York Rangers season|82 seasons]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6860998-100-ranger-greats#bookDetails |title=100 Ranger Greats: Superstars, Unsung Heroes and Colorful Characters |first1=Russ |last1=Cohen |first2=John |last2=Halligan |first3=Adam |last3=Raider |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn= 0470736194 |date=2009 |access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nHis #5 jersey has been retired by [[Jokerit]].\n\n===Tikkanese===\nTikkanen is famous for his Finnish-English, sometimes referred to as \"Tikkanese\" or \"Tiki-Talk.\" Even members of his team often did not understand what he was saying. [[Wayne Gretzky]] once commented, \"He brings something special. I don't know what it is, but if you ask him, you couldn't understand his answer.\" Former Edmonton Oiler coach and teammate [[Craig MacTavish]] said, \"Esa talks twice as much as anybody else. That's because you can understand just half what he says.\"\n\nEven fellow Finn [[Jari Kurri]] was not immune from the confusing language. During their tenure with the Oilers, Tikkanen let go with a particularly colorful pronouncement, after which another player turned to Kurri and asked, \"What did he just say?\" Kurri simply shook his head; \"I have no idea.\"<ref name=\"tikkanese\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/capitals/longterm/1998/stanleycup/finals/tikkan09.htm|title=Esa Tikkanen, Indecipherable on Ice|accessdate=2006-10-03|year=1998|publisher=Washington Post | date=June 6, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nEsa Tikkanen has been married twice. His first wife was Swedish Ann Charlotte (Lotta) Kraft and they have two daughters, Sabrina and Stephanie. Tikkanen separated after 17 years of marriage in 2000. Tikkanen got engaged to Finnish top model [[Marita Hakala]] in 2001. In 2004, Esa Tikkanen married Tua Backman. They have two sons and a daughter that were born in 2009. The couple divorced in 2014.\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n*[[1982\u201383 SM-liiga season|1982\u201383]] \u2013 [[SM-Liiga]] \u2013 [[Kanada-malja]] ([[HIFK (ice hockey)|HIFK]])\n*[[1984\u201385 NHL season|1984\u201385]] \u2013 [[National Hockey League|NHL]] \u2013 [[Stanley Cup]] ([[Edmonton Oilers|Edmonton]])\n*[[1986\u201387 NHL season|1986\u201387]] \u2013 NHL \u2013 Stanley Cup (Edmonton)\n*[[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388]] \u2013 NHL \u2013 Stanley Cup (Edmonton)\n*[[1989\u201390 NHL season|1989\u201390]] \u2013 NHL \u2013 Stanley Cup (Edmonton)\n*[[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394]] \u2013 NHL \u2013 Stanley Cup ([[New York Rangers]])\n*[[Clarence S.

The controversy stems from the fact that despite Tikkanen's extensive background in Jokerit juniors he only ever spent one season, his last in Finland, playing for Jokerit in the SM-liiga in comparison with four seasons at Jokeri's local rivals [[HIFK (ice hockey)|HIFK]]. The number retired was 5, although Tikkanen used number 10 during the most of his NHL career.\n* Tikkanen finished as runner-up for the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] three times.\n\n==Tikkanen, the racehorse==\nThe 1994 [[Breeders' Cup Turf]] was won by [[Tikkanen (horse)|Tikkanen]], a [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] named in Esa Tikkanen's honor by [[George W.

He played in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[New York Rangers]], [[St. Louis Blues]], [[New Jersey Devils]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Florida Panthers]], and the [[Washington Capitals]], and won the [[Stanley Cup]] five times in his career, including in [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|1985]], [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987]], [[1988 Stanley Cup Finals|1988]], [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals|1990]] with the Oilers, and [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] with the Rangers.\n\n==Background and early career==\nEsa Tikkanen began his career in hockey as a little boy by being a mascot for [[Jokerit]], a team based in Helsinki, Finland, and playing for the Jokerit junior team. After spending a year in Canada in 1981\u201382 with the [[Regina Blues]] of the [[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]] and [[Regina Pats]] of the [[Western Hockey League]], Tikkanen returned to Finland and signed with HJK and after a set of impressive performances signed a contract with Finland's leading team, [[HIFK (ice hockey)|HIFK]]. Tikkanen was drafted in the fourth round (80th overall) by the Oilers in the 1983 [[NHL Entry Draft]]. In 1984\u201385, he played 36 games for HIFK in the Finnish SM-liiga before joining the Oilers for their 1985 playoff run. He played briefly in the [[American Hockey League]] for the Oilers' affiliate the [[Nova Scotia Oilers]] in [[1985\u201386 AHL season|1985\u201386]], before joining the team full-time.\n\n==NHL playing career==\n\n===Start in Edmonton===\nIn his early twenties Tikkanen began his pro career in big leagues while additionally working as a coach in [[South Korea]]. Tikkanen made his NHL debut with the [[Edmonton Oilers]] during the second game of the [[1985 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. By playing one game in the [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|finals that year]], he was eligible to have his name engraved on the [[Stanley Cup]] even before playing his first regular-season game in the NHL. He soon became an important part of the Oilers, playing on the team's first line with [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Jari Kurri]]. Kurri and Gretzky's roles were to score goals; Tikkanen was the line's defensive player. Oilers coach and general manager [[Glen Sather]] once suggested that Tikkanen should be awarded the [[Frank J. Selke trophy]] (the award for the best defensive forward in the NHL). He was a finalist several times in his career, but never won the award. Tikkanen excelled at distracting and confusing opponents with his [[#Tikkanese|Tiki-Talk]]. Between 1986 and 1990, Tikkanen scored 30 or more goals three times and was on three more Cup champions. In 1991, he led the Edmonton Oilers in points in the regular season with 69 points.\n\n===Time after Oilers===\nIn March 1993, Tikkanen was traded to the [[New York Rangers]] for [[Doug Weight]], and he was part of that team's [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994 Stanley Cup victory]], scoring 22 goals and 54 points in 83 regular-season games. In July 1994, Tikkanen was traded with [[Doug Lidster]] to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for [[Petr Nedv\u011bd]].\n\nThe start of the NHL's 1994-95 season was delayed by a lockout, during which Tikkanen returned to Finland to play for [[HIFK|HIFK Helsinki]]. After the lockout Tikkanen, played with the Blues during the shortened 1995 season, and appeared in 11 games in 1995-96 before a trade sent him to the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Three weeks later he was again dealt, this time to the [[Vancouver Canucks]].\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season saw him involved in yet another midseason trade, back to the Rangers, in March. Although he contributed only one goal in 14 regular-season games with New York, he came alive in the playoffs, scoring 9 times in 15 games. Of the Rangers, only Gretzky, with 10, outscored Tikkanen. The Rangers eliminated the [[Florida Panthers]] and New Jersey Devils before falling to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe 32-year-old Tikkanen became a free agent in the summer of 1997, and he signed with the Panthers, but this would also prove to be a short stay. By March 1998 he had appeared in only 28 games, and Florida traded him to the [[Washington Capitals]] for [[Dwayne Hay]]. He appeared in all 21 of Washington's playoff games, as the Capitals went to the Stanley Cup finals, where they were swept in four straight games by the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Tikkanen is remembered for missing a wide-open shot on goal that would have iced Game 2, which has been described as a turning point of the Series.<ref name=wpost4292013>{{cite news|last=Svrluga|first=Barry|title=Washington Capitals coaches are direct link to team's run to 1998 Stanley Cup finals|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-coaches-are-direct-link-to-teams-run-to-1998-stanley-cup-finals/2013/04/29/2477b950-ac56-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story_3.html|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=29 April 2013}}</ref> This was to be Tikkanen's last full season in the NHL. After becoming a free agent prior to the 1998\u201399 season, he signed for a third stint with the Rangers. However, he only played in 32 games before an injury sidelined him for the rest of the season.\n\nBefore the start of the [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]] season, Tikkanen attended the Oilers' training camp and was offered a role of playing coach in the minors. Tikkanen declined the offer and returned to Finland, where he played a full season with Helsinki's second team, [[Jokerit]]. In 877 NHL games, he had scored 244 goals and 386 assists for 630 points, while racking up 1,077 minutes in penalties. In 186 Stanley Cup playoff games, he scored 72 goals and 60 assists for 132 points, with 275 penalty minutes.\n\n===Post NHL career===\nIn 1999\u20132000, Tikkanen played a season with Helsinki-based team [[Jokerit]], a rival team of HIFK, with whom Tikkanen had played earlier in his career. Jokerit finished in second place in the SM-Liiga. In 2000\u201301, Tikkanen moved to [[Germany]], where he played what was to be his last season in a recognized professional league for [[Moskitos Essen]] of the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]]. He retired in 2001.\n\nDuring the 2004\u201305 season, Tikkanen resurfaced again, this time as a player-coach for the [[Anyang Halla]], a [[South Korea]]n team in the [[Asia League Ice Hockey]].<ref name=\"ABCNews\">{{Cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=419077 |title = Sports}}</ref> Though he predicted that he and his two linemates would finish 1-2-3 in scoring,<ref name=\"Points123\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.asahi.com/english/sports/TKY200411260123.html |title = The Asahi Shimbun}}</ref> he finished tied for fourth on his team, with 8 goals and 17 assists for 25 points in 30 games. He was 29th in the league in assists, and didn't crack the top 30 in goals or points. He did, however, lead Halla in penalty minutes with 58 (tied for 28th in the league). Halla finished fifth in the league and did not make the playoffs.\n\nAfter one season in Korea, Tikkanen became the coach for [[Frisk Tigers]] of the Norwegian [[GET-ligaen]]. Tikkanen was head coach only for the [[2005\u201306 UPC-ligaen season|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nOn 27 December 2010 [[Jokipojat]] from [[Joensuu]], Finland, announced that Tikkanen would be the head coach of the team for the rest of the 2010-2011 season. Jokipojat plays in [[Mestis]], which is the second-highest league in Finland.\n\n==International play==\n{{MedalTableTop|}}\n{{MedalCountry | {{flagicon|Finland}} [[Finland]] }}\n{{MedalSport | Men's [[ice hockey]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Olympic Games]]}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Nagano]]|[[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Ice hockey]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]]}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2000 Russia]]|Ice hockey}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]]}}\n{{MedalSilver| [[1984 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1984 Sweden]]|Ice hockey}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\n\nEsa Tikkanen played 81 games for [[Finland national men's ice hockey team|Finnish National team]].\n\nTikkanen participated in two Canada Cups, 5 World Championship tournaments and the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\n==Notable achievements==\nTikkanen won the Stanley Cup four times as a member of the Oilers and once more as a member of the Rangers. His various acquisitions were by teams craving him for his playoff experience and success: in 877 regular season games he scored 244 goals, but in 186 playoff games he scored 72 goals which puts him 14th all time in NHL playoff scoring, and 38th all time in play-offs points with 132points. \"Tik\" was known for his ability to score clutch goals, but also for his general style of play\u2014chippy and aggressive. He was nicknamed \"The Grate One\" (a pun on teammate Gretzky's moniker \"The Great One\") for his ability to irritate opposing players, often just by talking to them in his Finnish-English \"Tikkanese\" or \"Tiki-Talk.\" His regular-season totals were 244 goals, 386 assists, and 1077 penalty minutes. In the playoffs, he added 72 goals, 60 assists, and 275 penalty minutes. Tikkanen also led the Edmonton Oilers with 69 points in the 1990-91 regular season. Tikkanen holds the NHL record for scoring two shorthanded goals in the shortest time (10 seconds apart). With 436 points and 178 goals as a member of Edmonton Oilers, he is rank 10th in points and 8th in goals in Edmonton Oilers all-time scoring leader. He's also 6th in Edmonton all-time scoring leader in team play-offs with 97 points, and 5th in goals with 51. He is also tied 20th all-time regular season short-handed goals leader with 29. He is also tied 4th all-time in play-offs overtime goals leader with 4 goals.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the Trailer Park Boys:Out of the Park in 2016.\n\nIn the 2009 book ''100 Ranger Greats'', the authors ranked Tikkanen at No. 85 all-time of the [[List of New York Rangers players|901 New York Rangers]] who had played during the team's first [[2008\u201309 New York Rangers season|82 seasons]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6860998-100-ranger-greats#bookDetails |title=100 Ranger Greats: Superstars, Unsung Heroes and Colorful Characters |first1=Russ |last1=Cohen |first2=John |last2=Halligan |first3=Adam |last3=Raider |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn= 0470736194 |date=2009 |access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nHis #5 jersey has been retired by [[Jokerit]].\n\n===Tikkanese===\nTikkanen is famous for his Finnish-English, sometimes referred to as \"Tikkanese\" or \"Tiki-Talk.\" Even members of his team often did not understand what he was saying. [[Wayne Gretzky]] once commented, \"He brings something special. I don't know what it is, but if you ask him, you couldn't understand his answer.\" Former Edmonton Oiler coach and teammate [[Craig MacTavish]] said, \"Esa talks twice as much as anybody else. That's because you can understand just half what he says.\"\n\nEven fellow Finn [[Jari Kurri]] was not immune from the confusing language. During their tenure with the Oilers, Tikkanen let go with a particularly colorful pronouncement, after which another player turned to Kurri and asked, \"What did he just say?\" Kurri simply shook his head; \"I have no idea.\"<ref name=\"tikkanese\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/capitals/longterm/1998/stanleycup/finals/tikkan09.htm|title=Esa Tikkanen, Indecipherable on Ice|accessdate=2006-10-03|year=1998|publisher=Washington Post | date=June 6, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nEsa Tikkanen has been married twice. His first wife was Swedish Ann Charlotte (Lotta) Kraft and they have two daughters, Sabrina and Stephanie. Tikkanen separated after 17 years of marriage in 2000.

The number retired was 5, although Tikkanen used number 10 during the most of his NHL career.\n* Tikkanen finished as runner-up for the [[Frank J.
