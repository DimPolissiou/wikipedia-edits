It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.

It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.
