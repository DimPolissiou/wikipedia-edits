The patient only showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020. {{As of|2020|04|05}}, seven additional cases have been confirmed, one each in Kathmandu and Kanchanpur districts, two in Baglung and three in Kailai. Seven of the eight active cases involve people who had recently reutrned from abroad; the first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in a 34-year-old woman from Kailali. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March, and is scheduled to end on 15 April.\n\nNepal established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India, starting in mid-January. Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds. The [[SAARC]] countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to ''Visit Nepal Year 2020''. Its economy is expected to be severely affected by the pandemic due its impact on foreign employment, tourism, manufacturing, construction and trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/govt-to-carry-out-impact-assessment-of-coronavirus-on-economy/|title=Govt to carry out impact assessment of coronavirus on economy|date=2020-03-06|website=The Himalayan Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331131059/https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/govt-to-carry-out-impact-assessment-of-coronavirus-on-economy/|archive-date=31 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===COVID-19 pandemic===\nThe ongoing [[pandemic]] of [[coronavirus disease 2019]] (COVID-19) is caused by <!--NO DEFINITE ARTICLE (\"THE\") AS PER VIRUS'S ARTICLE--> [[SARS-COV-2|severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2).<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus disease 2019 |url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=15 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130202553/https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The outbreak was first identified in [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei, China]], in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) on 11 March 2020.<ref name=\"WHOpandemic2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020|title=WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 \u2013 11 March 2020|date=11 March 2020|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=11 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200311212521/https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020|archive-date=11 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2020|3|29}}, more than 708,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 190 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 33,500 deaths.<ref name=\"WOM\" /> More than 150,000 people have since recovered.<ref name=\"WOM\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ |title=Coronavirus Update (Live) |work=Worldometer |date=2020 |access-date=16 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129195657/https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ |archive-date=29 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"JHU CSSE2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6|title=Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|accessdate=20 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304031313/https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6|archive-date=4 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe virus primarily [[Transmission (medicine)|spreads]] between people in a way similar to [[influenza]], via [[respiratory droplets]] from coughing or sneezing.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf |title=Getting your workplace ready for COVID-19 |date=27 February 2020 |work=World Health Organization |url-status=live |access-date=16 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302092018/https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf |archive-date=2 March 2020 }}</ref><!--Quote=In other words, COVID-19 spreads in a similar way to flu--><ref name=\"WHO2020QA\">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses |title=Q&A on coronaviruses |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |work=WHO.int |date=11 February 2020 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200120174649/https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses |archive-date=20 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><!--Quote=The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.--><ref name=\"CDC2020Over222\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html |title=Symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) |date=10 February 2020 |work=CDC.gov |publisher=US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]) |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130202038/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html |archive-date=30 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!--Quote=The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person&nbsp;....

The patient only showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020. {{As of|2020|04|05}}, seven additional cases have been confirmed, one each in Kathmandu and Kanchanpur districts, two in Baglung and three in Kailai. Seven of the eight active cases involve people who had recently reutrned from abroad; the first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in a 34-year-old woman from Kailali. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March, and is scheduled to end on 15 April.\n\nNepal established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India, starting in mid-January. Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds. The [[SAARC]] countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to ''Visit Nepal Year 2020''.

The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

He determined that the [[rare earth element]]s ([[lanthanide]]s), 13 of which were known, lay within that gap. Although Mendeleev knew of [[lanthanum]], cerium, and [[erbium]], they were previously unaccounted for in the table because the number of lanthanides and their exact order were not known. This was in part a consequence of their similar chemistry and imprecise determination of their atomic masses. Combined with the lack of a known group of similar elements, this rendered the placement of the lanthanides in the periodic table difficult.<ref name=LnChem>{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=S. |date=2006 |title=Lanthanide and Actinide Chemistry |chapter=Introduction to the lanthanides |pages=1\u20137 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-470-01005-1}}</ref> This discovery led to a restructuring of the table and the first appearance of the [[Periodic table#The long- or 32-column table|32-column form]].<ref name=1871table/>\n\n==Atomic theory and isotopes==\n<!--[[Image:Henry Moseley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Moseley]]]]-->\n[[File:Moseley step ladder.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|right|Photographic recording of the characteristic [[X-ray]] emission lines of elements with atomic number between 20 and 29]]\nFour radioactive elements were known in 1900: [[radium]], [[actinium]], [[thorium]], and [[uranium]]. These radioactive elements (termed \"radioelements\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied. Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties. Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] shells;<ref name=scerri98>{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=E.R. |title=The Evolution of the Periodic System |journal=Scientific American |date=1998 |volume=279 |issue=3 |pages=78\u201383 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0998-78 |url=https://mipt.ru/dasr/upload/62f/f_brx2-arphh81ii9w.pdf}}</ref> this forms the basis of the modern [[octet rule]].

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], suggested the appearance of the ''d'' subshell in period&nbsp;4 and the ''f''-subshell in period&nbsp;6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements.<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal |journal = Journal of Chemical Education |volume = 80 |issue = 8 |year = 2003 |url = http://www.uv.es/~borrasj/ingenieria_web/temas/tema_1/lecturas_comp/p952.pdf |title = The Place of Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury in the Periodic Table |first = William B. |last = Jensen |pages=952\u2013961 |doi = 10.1021/ed080p952 |bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..952J }}</ref>\n\n==Looking for expansions and the end of the periodic table==\nAs early as 1913, Bohr's research on [[electronic structure]] led physicists such as [[Johannes Rydberg]] to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium. Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties. Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] shells;<ref name=scerri98>{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=E.R. |title=The Evolution of the Periodic System |journal=Scientific American |date=1998 |volume=279 |issue=3 |pages=78\u201383 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0998-78 |url=https://mipt.ru/dasr/upload/62f/f_brx2-arphh81ii9w.pdf}}</ref> this forms the basis of the modern [[octet rule]].

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], suggested the appearance of the ''d'' subshell in period&nbsp;4 and the ''f''-subshell in period&nbsp;6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements.<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal |journal = Journal of Chemical Education |volume = 80 |issue = 8 |year = 2003 |url = http://www.uv.es/~borrasj/ingenieria_web/temas/tema_1/lecturas_comp/p952.pdf |title = The Place of Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury in the Periodic Table |first = William B. |last = Jensen |pages=952\u2013961 |doi = 10.1021/ed080p952 |bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..952J }}</ref>\n\n==Looking for expansions and the end of the periodic table==\nAs early as 1913, Bohr's research on [[electronic structure]] led physicists such as [[Johannes Rydberg]] to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium. Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\nThe Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth  of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]].

A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\n\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]] in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Italy)|Unknown Soldier]] since the end of World War I]]\n\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\nItaly, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\n=== Fascist regime ===\n{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]]]\nThe [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]  named the \"[[March on Rome]]\" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].\n\n[[File:Italy's colonial empire.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Italian Empire]] at its maximum extent, with colonies in light green and protectorates or occupied areas during [[World War II]] in grey]]\n\nThe [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.

The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| caption_align = center\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = [[Sergio Mattarella]]<br /><small>[[President of Italy]]<br />since 2015</small>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = [[Giuseppe Conte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br />since 2018</small>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;\u2013 which holds effective executive power&nbsp;\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archivedate=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].\n\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].<ref>Wheen, Andrew.

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline.

Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484\u20131486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]].

In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].

He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\nThe Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth  of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria.

A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\n\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]] in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Italy)|Unknown Soldier]] since the end of World War I]]\n\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\nItaly, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\n=== Fascist regime ===\n{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]]]\nThe [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]  named the \"[[March on Rome]]\" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].\n\n[[File:Italy's colonial empire.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Italian Empire]] at its maximum extent, with colonies in light green and protectorates or occupied areas during [[World War II]] in grey]]\n\nThe [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.

The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| caption_align = center\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = [[Sergio Mattarella]]<br /><small>[[President of Italy]]<br />since 2015</small>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = [[Giuseppe Conte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br />since 2018</small>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;\u2013 which holds effective executive power&nbsp;\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archivedate=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].\n\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].<ref>Wheen, Andrew.

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline.

Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484\u20131486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]].

In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].
