Patton had impressed him in an audition for an earlier feature film.  Finguerra called Patton a \"complete professional [and a] tremendous actor\", and enjoyable on set.<ref name=\"yorio\" />  He appeared in the [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'', in which he played, in a departure of his previous roles, \"a very angry man\".<ref>Barron, event occurs at 10.30</ref>  In 2014, he appeared in a small movie shot mostly in New Jersey, entitled ''Lies I Told My Little Sister'', directed by William Stribling and starring Lucy Walters.<ref name=\"animatedactor\" /><ref name=\"interview\" />\n\nPatton called his career, with its mixture of children's television and darker roles in independent films, \"an odd experience\" and told a reporter that he had spent half his life at [[Nickelodeon]].  In 2009, he was cast as Bot, the robot superhero, on the children's show ''[[Team Umizoomi]]'' through the relationships he had made at Nickelodeon on ''Blue's Clues''.<ref name=\"yorio\" />  He found working on ''Team Umizoomi'' \"comforting\" because many of the same crew, producers, and creators had also worked on ''Blue's Clues''.  It was the first time he had worked as a voice-over artist, unlike on ''Blue's Clues'', when he was able to be more physical acting in front of a [[Chroma key|blue screen]].<ref>Barron, event occurs at 3.10</ref>  He said, about ''Team Umizoomi'', \"the work the animators have done on it has been superlative\".<ref>Barron, event occurs at 0.38</ref>  He stated that he enjoyed working on ''Team Umizoomi'' because it gave him the opportunity to participate in a show from its inception, which he had missed with ''Blue's Clues''.<ref name=\"barron\"/>  Patton said his voice performance of Bot, which he modeled on [[Brent Spiner]]'s performance as the android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and was influenced by [[Mel Blanc]]'s work in the classic [[Warner Bros.

The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones.

They are the ones \u2013 while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot \u2013 who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones.

{"title_page": "Everybody Comes to Rick's", "text_new": "'''''Everybody Comes to Rick's''''' is an American play that was bought unproduced by [[Warner Brothers]] for a record figure of $20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20000|1940|r=-4|fmt=eq}}). It was adapted for film as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Written by [[Murray Burnett]] and [[Joan Alison]] in 1940, prior to the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States' entry into World War II]], the play was anti-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and pro-[[French Resistance]]. The film became an American classic, highly successful and [[List of films considered the best#Audience polls|ranked by many as the greatest film ever made]].\n\nFeeling they had not received full recognition for their contributions, Burnett and Alison tried to regain control of the property, but the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in 1986 that they had signed away their rights in their agreement with Warner Brothers. Under their threat not to renew the agreement when the copyright reverted to them, the film company paid them each $100,000 ({{Inflation|US|100000|1986|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) and the right to produce the original play. It was produced in 1991 at the [[Trafalgar Studios|Whitehall Theatre]] in [[London]], where it ran for six weeks.\n\n==Origin==\nIn the summer of 1938, while on vacation from his job as English teacher at a vocational school, Burnett and his wife Frances traveled to [[Vienna]] to help [[Jew]]ish relatives smuggle money out of the country occupied by the [[Nazis]] since March of that year.<ref name=\"harmetz\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/29/arts/murray-burnett-86-writer-of-play-behind-casablanca.html Aljean Harmetz, Obituary: \"Murray Burnett, 86, Writer Of Play Behind 'Casablanca'\"] ''New York Times,'' 29 September 1997, accessed 20 May 2013</ref> Later, the couple visited a small town in the south of France, where they went to a nightclub overlooking the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A black pianist played jazz for a crowd of French, Nazis, and refugees.\n\nBurnett returned to the USA via the UK, staying a few weeks in [[Bournemouth]]. While there he started to make notes for his anti-Nazi play. In the summer of 1940, the 27-year-old teacher completed the play in six weeks with the collaboration of Joan Alison.<ref name=\"harmetz\"/> They featured Rick, an American bar owner of the ''Caf\u00e9 Americain'' in [[Casablanca (city)|Casablanca]], [[Morocco]], whose European inhabitants, military personnel and refugees often frequent the cafe. Eventually, Rick helps an idealistic Czech resistance fighter escape with the woman Rick loves.\n\nSoon after, Carly Wharton and Martin Gabel took an option to produce the play.

Epstein|Julius]] and [[Philip Epstein]], who worked on the overall structure and dialogue; and screenwriter [[Howard E. Koch|Howard Koch]], who worked on the politics. Only Koch was with the project during filming, when he continued to write new dialogue and scenes.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The title was changed to ''Casablanca''.\n\nThe inclusion of \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" came from Burnett and Alison's play. The song, from 1931, had been Burnett's favorite when he was a student at [[Cornell University|Cornell]]. \"As Time Goes By\", written by Herman Hupfeld, was first performed by Frances Williams in the musical comedy ''Everybody's Welcome'', which had played on Broadway from October 1931 to February 1932.\n\n===Characters in Play & Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Koch and the Epsteins received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best screenplay in 1943, but little recognition was given to Burnett and Alison.\n\nThe lead actors were not particularly aware of the film's basis.

Burnett also said that he wanted to control his characters and intended to complete a sequel to the play. In 1986, the New York State Court of Appeals determined that the pair had signed away all rights to their work under the terms of their agreement when they sold the play.

It was adapted for film as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Written by [[Murray Burnett]] and [[Joan Alison]] in 1940, prior to the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States' entry into World War II]], the play was anti-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and pro-[[French Resistance]]. The film became an American classic, highly successful and [[List of films considered the best#Audience polls|ranked by many as the greatest film ever made]].\n\nFeeling they had not received full recognition for their contributions, Burnett and Alison tried to regain control of the property, but the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in 1986 that they had signed away their rights in their agreement with Warner Brothers. Under their threat not to renew the agreement when the copyright reverted to them, the film company paid them each $100,000 ({{Inflation|US|100000|1986|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) and the right to produce the original play. It was produced in 1991 at the [[Trafalgar Studios|Whitehall Theatre]] in [[London]], where it ran for six weeks.\n\n==Origin==\nIn the summer of 1938, while on vacation from his job as English teacher at a vocational school, Burnett and his wife Frances traveled to [[Vienna]] to help [[Jew]]ish relatives smuggle money out of the country occupied by the [[Nazis]] since March of that year.<ref name=\"harmetz\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/29/arts/murray-burnett-86-writer-of-play-behind-casablanca.html Aljean Harmetz, Obituary: \"Murray Burnett, 86, Writer Of Play Behind 'Casablanca'\"] ''New York Times,'' 29 September 1997, accessed 20 May 2013</ref> Later, the couple visited a small town in the south of France, where they went to a nightclub overlooking the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A black pianist played jazz for a crowd of French, Nazis, and refugees.\n\nBurnett returned to the USA via the UK, staying a few weeks in [[Bournemouth]]. While there he started to make notes for his anti-Nazi play. In the summer of 1940, the 27-year-old teacher completed the play in six weeks with the collaboration of Joan Alison.<ref name=\"harmetz\"/> They featured Rick, an American bar owner of the ''Caf\u00e9 Americain'' in [[Casablanca (city)|Casablanca]], [[Morocco]], whose European inhabitants, military personnel and refugees often frequent the cafe. Eventually, Rick helps an idealistic Czech resistance fighter escape with the woman Rick loves.\n\nSoon after, Carly Wharton and Martin Gabel took an option to produce the play. But there was resistance since it might seem to some that Lois (Ilsa in the movie) \"had slept with Rick in Casablanca in order to get the letters of transit\".<ref name=\"margolick\"/>\n\n==''Casablanca''==\n{{main|Casablanca (film)}}\nWhen Burnett and Alison failed to find a Broadway producer, they sold the play to [[Warner Brothers]] for $20,000, considered a record for an unproduced play, especially by two unknown writers.<ref name=\"margolick\"/> A story editor, Irene Lee Diamond, had read it in manuscript in New York, and recommended it for \"sophisticated hokum\".<ref name=\"newyorker\">[http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/everybody-comes-to-ricks-casablanca-on-the-big-screen David Denby, \"'Everybody Comes to Rick's': 'Casablanca' on the Big Screen'\"], ''The New Yorker'', accessed 20 May 2013</ref>\n\nWarner Brothers gave the script for adaptation first to screenwriter [[Casey Robinson]], who worked on the romantic pairing of Rick and Ilsa; twin-brother screenwriters [[Julius J. Epstein|Julius]] and [[Philip Epstein]], who worked on the overall structure and dialogue; and screenwriter [[Howard E. Koch|Howard Koch]], who worked on the politics. Only Koch was with the project during filming, when he continued to write new dialogue and scenes.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The title was changed to ''Casablanca''.\n\nThe inclusion of \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" came from Burnett and Alison's play. The song, from 1931, had been Burnett's favorite when he was a student at [[Cornell University|Cornell]]. \"As Time Goes By\", written by Herman Hupfeld, was first performed by Frances Williams in the musical comedy ''Everybody's Welcome'', which had played on Broadway from October 1931 to February 1932.\n\n===Characters in Play & Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Based on a Play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison.\" After the success of ''Casablanca'', Warner Brothers and the credited screenwriters downplayed the significance of the play in relation to the movie. Koch and the Epsteins received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best screenplay in 1943, but little recognition was given to Burnett and Alison.\n\nThe lead actors were not particularly aware of the film's basis. For instance, in 1974, [[Ingrid Bergman]] said in an interview: \"Adapted from a play? ''Casablanca''? I don't think so.\" <ref name=\"gritten\">[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-14/entertainment/ca-2021_1_stage-play David Gritten, \"You Must Remember This : The 'Casablanca' Story Began as a Play--and After 50 Years, Finds a Stage\"], ''Los Angeles Times,'' 14 May 1991, accessed 21 May 2015</ref>\n\nIn 1973, the screenwriter [[Howard E. Koch|Howard Koch]] wrote in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that ''Everybody Comes to Rick's'' \"provided an exotic locale and a character named Rick who ran a cafe but little in the way of a story adaptable to the screen\".<ref name=\"harmetz\"/> Burnett unsuccessfully sued for $6.5 million in damages, contending his play had provided the heart of the film.<ref name=\"harmetz\"/> In 1991, Howard Koch, who was then 89 years old, said in a letter to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that, after rereading the play, he thought it had provided \"the spine\" of the movie.<ref name=\"harmetz\"/>\n\nWhen the television series based on ''Casablanca'' aired in 1983, Burnett and Alison sued Warner Brothers for royalties. Burnett also said that he wanted to control his characters and intended to complete a sequel to the play. In 1986, the New York State Court of Appeals determined that the pair had signed away all rights to their work under the terms of their agreement when they sold the play. With the copyright due to revert to Burnett and Alison in 1997, they threatened not to renew their agreement with Warner Brothers. The company paid them each $100,000<ref name=\"harmetz\"/> and gave them the right to produce the original play.<ref name=\"margolick\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/10/nyregion/the-creator-of-rick-s-cafe-seeks-rights-to-casablanca-characters.html David Margolick, \"The Creator of Rick's Cafe Seeks Rights to 'Casablanca' Characters\"], ''New York Times,'' 10 October 1985, accessed 20 May 2013</ref>\n\n==Stage production==\nIn July 1991 ''Everybody Comes to Rick's'' was produced by David Kelsey at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London.

He was a high school teacher at Central Commercial High School before becoming a playwright.\n\nAfter a trip to Europe in 1938 to help their Jewish relatives smuggle money out of Nazi-occupied Austria, the Burnetts went to the Mediterranean. They saw many exiles and refugees there. Burnett was inspired by events to make notes for a play.\n\nHe completed the play about \"Rick's\" during the summer of 1940, in collaboration with his writer friend,<ref>{{Cite book|title=We'll Always Have Casablanca|last=Isenberg|first=Noah|publisher=W.

Madou''. This show was adapted as ''Time for Love'', which ran for 38 episodes on CBS Radio in 1953.\n\nAt the time of his and Alison's suit in 1985, Burnett was working for Corporation for Entertainment and Learning in Manhattan. He had the first 15 pages written for a sequel to ''Everybody Comes to Rick's''.<ref name=\"margolick\"/>\n\nHe was first married to Frances, with whom he had traveled to Europe in 1938.
