It covers an area of about 21&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Administratively it is a subdistrict (''[[tambon]]'') of [[Ko Pha-ngan District]] (''[[amphoe]]'') of [[Surat Thani Province]]. {{As of|2006}} its official population was 1,382.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The main settlement is Ban Mae Hat.\n\nThe economy of the island is almost exclusively centered on tourism, especially [[scuba diving]].\n\n== History ==\nInitially{{when|date=November 2012}} the island was uninhabited, with only the occasional fisherman from the neighbouring islands, looking for shelter in a storm or just resting before continuing on his journey.\n\nIt would appear from old maps and descriptions that this island was known by European cartographers and mariners as \"Pulo Bardia\", indicating that it was first settled by Malayo-Polynesian peoples. The old maps show a chain of three islands aligned north-south and lying off the east coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The most northerly and smallest of these islands is marked P. Bardia, the name it had until the early 1900s. The best map example is by John Thornton from ''The English Pilot, the Third Book'', dated 1701, but the specific map of the Gulf of Siam is dated around 1677.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thornton |first1=John |title=The English Pilot, the Third Book |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |url=http://prints.rmg.co.uk/image/795734/john-seller-john-thornton-william-fisher-john-colson-james-atkinson-a-chart-of-the-trading-part-of-the-east-indies-and-china-with-the-adjacent-islands-from-surrat-to-japan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503114658/http://prints.rmg.co.uk/image/795734/john-seller-john-thornton-william-fisher-john-colson-james-atkinson-a-chart-of-the-trading-part-of-the-east-indies-and-china-with-the-adjacent-islands-from-surrat-to-japan |archive-date=3 May 2012 }}</ref> Also see maps of the East Indies by William Dampier c.1697.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} By modern standards of accuracy, the islands are poorly placed on early maps. Seventeenth century marine navigation and cartography used the \"[[backstaff]]\" which, in this area, was accurate to one degree of longitude, or around 60 nautical miles.\n\n''The Edinburgh Gazetteer, or Geographical Dictionary'' published in 1827 also mentions the island and provides a geographical position.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Edinburgh Gazetteer, or Geographical Dictionary:...|date=1827|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green|location=London|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6uea5f4qw4UC&pg=PA383&lpg=PA383&dq=%27The+Edinburgh+Gazetteer%27+bardia#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref> In his 1852 book titled ''Narrative of a Residence in Siam.'' by Frederick Arthur Neale, the author describes the people and wildlife of Bardia. According to the account there were farms and even cows in a village on the bay lying on the west side of the island. The book includes a fanciful illustration of \"Bardia\" showing huts and palm trees.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neale|first1=Frederick Arthur|title=Narrative of a Residence in Siam.|date=1852|publisher=Office of the National Illustrated Library|location=London|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vJsFAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22Pulo+Bardia%22#v=onepage&q=%22Pulo%20Bardia%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Huddart in 1801 included these directions for navigating the islands, \"To the N.W. by N are two islands of about the same height as Poolo Carnom [Ko Samui]; the first, called SANCORY [Ko Pha-ngan], is 7 leagues from Carnom; the other...,named BARDA, or ''Bardia'' [Ko Tao], is 7\u00bd leagues from Sancory.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huddart|first1=Joseph|title=The Oriental Navigator; or, New DIrection for Sailing to and from the East Indies, China, New Holland, etc.,...|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbwBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA459&dq=bardia+siam#v=onepage&q=bardia%20siam&f=false|date=1801|publisher=Robert Laurie and James Whittle|location=London|page=459|edition=2nd|accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref> (A league is approximately 3 nautical miles or 5.5&nbsp;km.)\n\nOn 18 June 1899, King [[Chulalongkorn]] visited Ko Tao and left as evidence his monogram on a huge boulder at Jor Por Ror Bay next to Sairee Beach. This place is still worshiped today.{{by whom|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn 1933 the island started to be used as a political prison. In 1947 [[Khuang Abhaiwongse]], prime minister at that time, pleaded and received a royal pardon for all prisoners on the island. Everybody was taken to the shore of Surat Thani and Ko Tao was abandoned again.\n\nIn the 1980s overseas travellers began to visit Ko Tao and it quickly became a popular destination. In the 1990s the island became known as a diving site.\n\n==Environment==\nThe island is an important breeding ground for [[Hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]] and [[green turtle]]s. The development of tourism has negatively impacted the health of these grounds, but a breeding programme organised in 2004 by the [[Royal Thai Navy]] and KT-DOC, a coalition of local scuba diving centres, has reintroduced hundreds of juvenile turtles to the island's ecosystem.\n\nChumpon Pinnacle, a dive site to the west of the island has a reputation for divers in search of both whale sharks and bull sharks. However, because of warmer water temperatures over the last year a great number of bull sharks have migrated to cooler waters. The island is host to over 130 species of hard corals, and over 223 species of reef fishes belonging to 53 families.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scaps|first=Patrick |author2=Chad M.

It covers an area of about 21&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Administratively it is a subdistrict (''[[tambon]]'') of [[Ko Pha-ngan District]] (''[[amphoe]]'') of [[Surat Thani Province]]. {{As of|2006}} its official population was 1,382.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The main settlement is Ban Mae Hat.\n\nThe economy of the island is almost exclusively centered on tourism, especially [[scuba diving]].\n\n== History ==\nInitially{{when|date=November 2012}} the island was uninhabited, with only the occasional fisherman from the neighbouring islands, looking for shelter in a storm or just resting before continuing on his journey.\n\nIt would appear from old maps and descriptions that this island was known by European cartographers and mariners as \"Pulo Bardia\", indicating that it was first settled by Malayo-Polynesian peoples. The old maps show a chain of three islands aligned north-south and lying off the east coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The most northerly and smallest of these islands is marked P. Bardia, the name it had until the early 1900s. The best map example is by John Thornton from ''The English Pilot, the Third Book'', dated 1701, but the specific map of the Gulf of Siam is dated around 1677.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thornton |first1=John |title=The English Pilot, the Third Book |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |url=http://prints.rmg.co.uk/image/795734/john-seller-john-thornton-william-fisher-john-colson-james-atkinson-a-chart-of-the-trading-part-of-the-east-indies-and-china-with-the-adjacent-islands-from-surrat-to-japan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503114658/http://prints.rmg.co.uk/image/795734/john-seller-john-thornton-william-fisher-john-colson-james-atkinson-a-chart-of-the-trading-part-of-the-east-indies-and-china-with-the-adjacent-islands-from-surrat-to-japan |archive-date=3 May 2012 }}</ref> Also see maps of the East Indies by William Dampier c.1697.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} By modern standards of accuracy, the islands are poorly placed on early maps. Seventeenth century marine navigation and cartography used the \"[[backstaff]]\" which, in this area, was accurate to one degree of longitude, or around 60 nautical miles.\n\n''The Edinburgh Gazetteer, or Geographical Dictionary'' published in 1827 also mentions the island and provides a geographical position.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Edinburgh Gazetteer, or Geographical Dictionary:...|date=1827|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green|location=London|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6uea5f4qw4UC&pg=PA383&lpg=PA383&dq=%27The+Edinburgh+Gazetteer%27+bardia#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref> In his 1852 book titled ''Narrative of a Residence in Siam.'' by Frederick Arthur Neale, the author describes the people and wildlife of Bardia. According to the account there were farms and even cows in a village on the bay lying on the west side of the island. The book includes a fanciful illustration of \"Bardia\" showing huts and palm trees.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neale|first1=Frederick Arthur|title=Narrative of a Residence in Siam.|date=1852|publisher=Office of the National Illustrated Library|location=London|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vJsFAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22Pulo+Bardia%22#v=onepage&q=%22Pulo%20Bardia%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Huddart in 1801 included these directions for navigating the islands, \"To the N.W. by N are two islands of about the same height as Poolo Carnom [Ko Samui]; the first, called SANCORY [Ko Pha-ngan], is 7 leagues from Carnom; the other...,named BARDA, or ''Bardia'' [Ko Tao], is 7\u00bd leagues from Sancory.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huddart|first1=Joseph|title=The Oriental Navigator; or, New DIrection for Sailing to and from the East Indies, China, New Holland, etc.,...|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbwBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA459&dq=bardia+siam#v=onepage&q=bardia%20siam&f=false|date=1801|publisher=Robert Laurie and James Whittle|location=London|page=459|edition=2nd|accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref> (A league is approximately 3 nautical miles or 5.5&nbsp;km.)\n\nOn 18 June 1899, King [[Chulalongkorn]] visited Ko Tao and left as evidence his monogram on a huge boulder at Jor Por Ror Bay next to Sairee Beach. This place is still worshiped today.{{by whom|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn 1933 the island started to be used as a political prison. In 1947 [[Khuang Abhaiwongse]], prime minister at that time, pleaded and received a royal pardon for all prisoners on the island. Everybody was taken to the shore of Surat Thani and Ko Tao was abandoned again.\n\nIn the 1980s overseas travellers began to visit Ko Tao and it quickly became a popular destination. In the 1990s the island became known as a diving site.\n\n==Environment==\nThe island is an important breeding ground for [[Hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]] and [[green turtle]]s. The development of tourism has negatively impacted the health of these grounds, but a breeding programme organised in 2004 by the [[Royal Thai Navy]] and KT-DOC, a coalition of local scuba diving centres, has reintroduced hundreds of juvenile turtles to the island's ecosystem.\n\nChumpon Pinnacle, a dive site to the west of the island has a reputation for divers in search of both whale sharks and bull sharks. However, because of warmer water temperatures over the last year a great number of bull sharks have migrated to cooler waters. The island is host to over 130 species of hard corals, and over 223 species of reef fishes belonging to 53 families.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scaps|first=Patrick |author2=Chad M.

For the past two years the demographics of the island have seen an age increase, with many of the visitors who first visited the island over ten years ago now returning with their families.\n\nA series of tourist deaths \u2013 including murder and alleged suicide \u2013 particularly since 2014, has prompted some to advise that tourists avoid visiting Ko Tao.<ref name=\"Independent-20170705\">{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Elaine|title=Thailand's Dark Side: Why You Really Shouldn't Visit Koh Tao|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/asia/koh-tao-thailand-dark-side-car-crash-murders-mafia-suspicious-deaths-a7824171.html|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=The Independent|date=5 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Promchertchoo|first1=Pichayada|title=Thailand's beauty 'very dangerous trap': Sister of Koh Tao victim|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/author/7576756|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Matt|title=Families of murdered tourists on Koh Tao, dubbed Death Island, warn tourists to stay away|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/warnings/families-of-murdered-tourists-on-koh-tao-dubbed-death-island-warn-tourists-to-stay-away/news-story/b078e937a7510db09e174aa61be54f24|accessdate=23 March 2018|work=News.com.au|date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\nTo serve the tourist population, some 3,000\u20135,000 Burmese workers staff the island.<ref name=\"Time-20150717\">{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Charlie|title=This Septic Isle: Backpackers, Bloodshed and the Secretive World of Koh Tao|url=http://time.com/3955081/thailand-koh-tao-murder-david-miller-hannah-witheridge-zaw-lin-wai-phyo-burma-myanmar/|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=Time|date=17 July 2015}}</ref> There is a dominant Thai family on the island that owns several dive schools, resorts, and bars.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Koh Tao's dark side: dangers of island where Britons were murdered|author= Peter Walker |date=24 November 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/23/briton-thailand-murder-hannah-witheridge-david-miller-mystery-mafia-fear}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:KoTaoMainStreet.JPG|thumb|Main street, Ko Tao]]\n\nMotorbikes are the main form of transport, however visitors are advised to drive responsibly as motorbikes are the main cause of injury to tourists in the area.\n\n==Ferries==\nFerry companies Lomprayah, Seatran, and Songserm serve Ko Tao from: \n*[[Surat Thani]] (4 hours day boat, 9 hours on overnight boat)\n*[[Chumphon]] (1.5\u20133 hours, 7 hours on overnight boat)\n*[[Ko Samui]] (approximately 2.5 hours)\n*[[Ko Pha-ngan]] (approximately 1.5\u20132 hours). \nAll ferries dock at Ban Mae Haad.

Upon royal assent, the first Queen's Plate was run on June 27, 1860, at the [[Carleton racetrack]] in [[Toronto]], with the prize of \"a plate to the value of 50 [[guineas]]\". Despite the name of the race, the winning owner is presented with a gold cup rather than a plate.<ref name=\"QPHistory\">{{cite web |title=History of Queen's Plate |url=http://www.queensplate.com/Pages/History-of-Queen-Plate.aspx |website=www.queensplate.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the race was restricted to three-year-olds bred in Upper Canada that had never won a stakes race. The race was originally run in heats, with a horse having to win two heats to be declared the winner. Over the years, the race conditions have evolved. Heat racing was discontinued in 1879, and the race was opened to stakes winners around the same time (some early records are incomplete). For many years, the race was open to older horses and in the early 1900s was even open to two-year-olds. The race is currently restricted to three-year-olds foaled in Canada. The owner must pay a nomination fee ($500 in 2018) in February, a second subscription fee ($1,500 in 2018) in May and a final entry fee ($10,000) in late June prior to the race.<ref name=WildRose /><ref name=Results /><ref>{{cite web |title=Nomination Form |url=https://woodbine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018-Canadian-Triple-Crown-Nomination-Form.pdf |website=woodbine.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first four renewals were run at Carleton racetrack.

The race continued to be held at Old Woodbine until that track was replaced by \"New\" [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] in northern Toronto in 1956. The race has been run at Woodbine ever since. In 2006, Woodbine changed the track surface for the main track from natural dirt to a synthetic surface known as Polytrack. In 2016, the surface was changed to Tapeta. Because of the change in racing surfaces, Woodbine maintains several sets of track and stakes records. The fastest time for the race since 1957, the year in which the race was set at its current length of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, is 2:01 4/5, set by [[Kinghaven Farms]] [[Izvestia (horse)|Izvestia]] in 1990 over a dirt surface.

The race takes place each summer, in June or July, at [[Woodbine Racetrack]], [[Etobicoke, Ontario]], and is the first race in the [[Canadian Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Canadian Triple Crown]].\n\nThe 2020 event was canceled in April because of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6825902/rbc-canadian-open-2020-cancelled-coronavirus-covid19/ |title=RBC Canadian Open in mid-June is cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic |date=16 April 2020 |publisher=Global News |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1859, while [[Upper Canada]] was still a colony of Great Britain, the then-president of the Toronto Turf Club, Sir [[Casimir Gzowski]], petitioned [[Queen Victoria]] to grant a plate for a new race in the territory. Upon royal assent, the first Queen's Plate was run on June 27, 1860, at the [[Carleton racetrack]] in [[Toronto]], with the prize of \"a plate to the value of 50 [[guineas]]\". Despite the name of the race, the winning owner is presented with a gold cup rather than a plate.<ref name=\"QPHistory\">{{cite web |title=History of Queen's Plate |url=http://www.queensplate.com/Pages/History-of-Queen-Plate.aspx |website=www.queensplate.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the race was restricted to three-year-olds bred in Upper Canada that had never won a stakes race. The race was originally run in heats, with a horse having to win two heats to be declared the winner. Over the years, the race conditions have evolved. Heat racing was discontinued in 1879, and the race was opened to stakes winners around the same time (some early records are incomplete). For many years, the race was open to older horses and in the early 1900s was even open to two-year-olds. The race is currently restricted to three-year-olds foaled in Canada. The owner must pay a nomination fee ($500 in 2018) in February, a second subscription fee ($1,500 in 2018) in May and a final entry fee ($10,000) in late June prior to the race.<ref name=WildRose /><ref name=Results /><ref>{{cite web |title=Nomination Form |url=https://woodbine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018-Canadian-Triple-Crown-Nomination-Form.pdf |website=woodbine.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first four renewals were run at Carleton racetrack. After that, the Queen's Plate became a \"movable feast\", with politicians from all over modern-day Ontario vying to host the race in their constituency. Fifteen different race tracks hosted the race over the next two decades, with distances varying from one to two miles.<ref name=\"WildRose\">{{cite web |last1=Nevills |first1=Joe |title=How Wild Rose won the Queen\u2019s Plate in 1867 - and again 19 years later |url=https://thoroughbredracing.com/articles/how-wild-rose-won-queens-plate-1867-and-again-19-years-later/ |website=Thoroughbred Racing Commentary |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> In 1883, the race moved to [[Old Woodbine Race Course|Old Woodbine]], located in eastern Toronto along Lake Ontario. The race continued to be held at Old Woodbine until that track was replaced by \"New\" [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] in northern Toronto in 1956. The race has been run at Woodbine ever since. In 2006, Woodbine changed the track surface for the main track from natural dirt to a synthetic surface known as Polytrack. In 2016, the surface was changed to Tapeta. Because of the change in racing surfaces, Woodbine maintains several sets of track and stakes records. The fastest time for the race since 1957, the year in which the race was set at its current length of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, is 2:01 4/5, set by [[Kinghaven Farms]] [[Izvestia (horse)|Izvestia]] in 1990 over a dirt surface. However, because the race is now run over an artificial dirt surface, the modern stakes record is 2:02.26, set by Wonder Gadot in 2018.<ref name=Results /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mauntah |first1=Richard |title=Woodbine ready to showcase new Tapeta racing surface |url=http://torontosun.com/2016/04/07/woodbine-ready-to-showcase-new-tapeta-racing-surface/wcm/0aedb44e-7120-43d4-9ca4-acd812e56acb |website=Toronto Sun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |date=8 April 2016}}</ref>\n \nIn 1902, the year after Victoria's death, the race became the King's Plate, after her successor, [[Edward VII]]. It became the Queen's Plate again when [[Elizabeth II]] came to the throne in 1952.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/queens-plate/ The Canadian Encyclopedia]. Published 2012-08-20, last edited 2014-03-07.</ref>\n\nHorses owned by [[Windfields Farm]] have won the Queen's Plate eleven times, but the most successful was the stable owned by [[Joseph E. Seagram]], a prominent [[Distilled beverage|distiller]] from [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Seagram's stable won the Queen's Plate on twenty occasions between 1891 and 1935 including eight times in a row between 1891 and 1898, and ten times in eleven years from 1891 to 1901.\n\nIn 1964, [[Northern Dancer]], the first Canadian-bred horse to win the [[Kentucky Derby]], also won the Queen's Plate in his final race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero|url=http://horseracinghalloffame.com/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[Josie Carroll]] became the first woman [[horse trainer|trainer]] to win the Queen's Plate. The following year, [[Emma-Jayne Wilson]] became the first female [[jockey]] to win the race.\n\nThe 2004-2013 Plate winners had little success in their subsequent racing careers. This compares unfavourably to the 1990s when a number of Plate winners had considerable success thereafter, including [[With Approval]], [[Izvestia (horse)|Izvestia]], [[Dance Smartly]] and [[Awesome Again]]. The more recent Queen's Plate winners have also been successful, including [[Lexie Lou]] (who became a multiple graded stakes winner in Canada and the US after winning the Plate in 2014) and [[Shaman Ghost]] (a Grade I winner in America after winning the Plate in 2015).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shields |first1=Emily |title=Why the Queen\u2019s Plate is so much more than just Canada\u2019s most famous race |url=https://thoroughbredracing.com/articles/why-queens-plate-so-much-more-just-canadas-most-famous-horse-race/ |website=Thoroughbred Racing Commentary |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNick Eaves, former President and CEO of [[Woodbine Entertainment Group]], announced during the 2012 Queen's Plate post position draw that Woodbine Racetrack may be forced to close in April 2013 due to the cancellation of Slots at Racetrack program partnerships between Ontario's racetracks and the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]].
