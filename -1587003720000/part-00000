'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]]  Background=\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something.

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by '''British Lion''' and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]]  Background=\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something. I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

He released two more singles in 1965 under the names of The Manish Boys and Davy Jones & the Lower Third. His first release using the name David Bowie was the 1966 single \"[[Can't Help Thinking About Me]]\", which was released with The Lower Third. Bowie's next single, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\", also released in 1966, was the first release by simply David Bowie. Bowie released four more singles and his debut album, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', but the first success in the United Kingdom was with the 1969 single \"[[Space Oddity]]\". The single reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after it was released five days before the [[Apollo 11]] moon mission.<ref name=\"guinness\">Roberts, David (editor) (2006) [1977].

Following the success of ''Ziggy Stardust'', sales of ''Hunky Dory'' improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. [[RCA Records|RCA]] re-released the 1969'' David Bowie''  under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'', which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively (but the last one reached number 21 after the Bowie'death in 2016).\nBowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (1973), ''[[Pin Ups]]'' (1973), ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974) and ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' (1980) reached the number one position.

''Let's Dance'' and ''Tonight'' reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while ''Never Let Me Down'' reached number six. The success of ''Let's Dance'' revitalized Bowie's back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

These dates must be incorrect because Bowie played The Tower Theater for six nights, from 8 July to 13 July. D\u00f6pke goes on to say: \"On later pressings, this error has been corrected (although the new dates given, 12-13/07/1974, are still not entirely correct).\" D\u00f6pke notes the corrected pressings begin from October 1974, which given the first pressing was released on 21 October 1974, the mistake must have been realised and corrected during the run up to release. The correct dates of the recording, according to D\u00f6pke, are 10-13/07/1974.<ref name=\"bowie-collection.de\">http://www.bowie-collection.de/</ref>\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_live_b}} There were some overdubs recorded in post-production (before mixing) for ''David Live''. Nic Pegg writes 'The backing vocals and some of the saxophone parts were re-recorded at Record Plant because, according to [Tony] Visconti [who supervised the post-production and mixed the album], \"the backing singers and horn players were often sporadically off microphone due to excitement, I guess.\" Similarly, Mike Garson re-recorded his piano solo for \"Aladdin Sane\" because \"the original was wiped. It was only 16-track so I guess that was the only way it could be done then\".' <ref name=\"Pegg, p. 373\"/>\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_live_c}} According to Nic Pegg, Tony Visconti, who was recording and mixing the album, thought 'many of the numbers too fast after the first night's recording in Philadelphia, and the band re-rehearsed on the afternoon of 29 April to re-establish the original studio tempi. So consistent were the band's performances thereafter, explained Victonti, \"that we were able to use the intro and outro of 'Station to Station' from Boston and the bulk from Rhode Island\".' It is thus unlikely any of the recordings from the 28th April were used on the final album.<ref>Pegg, p. 393</ref>\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_live_d}} An early mix of the sound was created by Ken Scott in 1973, and it was this that was used for the [[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (film)|film]] soundtrack in early broadcasts and screenings. In 1981, Bowie and producer Tony Visconti prepared a new mix for both the release of the film and the release of an accompanying album. Nic Pegg writes: 'Visconti, who described the process as \"more of a salvage job than an artistic endeavour\", explained that \"the sound quality was poor and I was called in to beef it up, which also required David and me to resing many of the backing vocals. They were simply not recorded well on tape \u2013 partly because Trevor Bolder and Mick Ronson didn't sing into the microphones!\"'. In addition, two songs featured Jeff Beck on guitar: \"The Jean Genie / Love Me Do\" medley and \"Round and Round\". Beck redid his solos in December 1981 at CTS Studios, London. However, in the end Beck refused to allow the two songs to be included in the soundtrack (and, of course, in the film).<ref>Pegg, p. 404-5</ref>\n* '''e'''{{Note|note_live_e1}}{{Note|note_live_e2}} The songs on the ''Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby'' album came from a number of shows in the US and Japan: 20 November 1991 in Boston; 27 or 29 November 1991 in New York; 7 December 1991 in Chicago; 10 or 11 February 1992 in Sapporo; 17 February 1992 in Tokyo.\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_live_f}} The ''liveandwell.com'' album was a limited edition live release not available commercially but via subscribing to [[David Bowie#BowieNet|BowieNet]]. 'Although Bowie hoped for the album to have a full commercial release, his label Virgin was unenthusiastic and refused to issue it.' <ref>{{cite web|title=liveandWwll.com|url=https://www.bowiebible.com/albums/liveandwell-com/|website=Bowie Bible|accessdate=17 October 2019|language=en}}</ref> The album only features songs from the albums ''Earthling'' (1997) and ''1. Outside'' (1995). \n* '''g'''{{Note|note_live_g}} The ''Glass Spider'' live album is sourced from a professional recording for a CD promo set that was distributed among American radio stations in late 1987 / early 1988.

These were: \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" / \"Karma Man\" (recorded 1 September 1967) and \"In The Heat Of The Morning\" / \"London Bye Ta-Ta\" [1968 version] (recorded 12 March 1968). Both had a more mainstream pop feel than his previous baroque pop period (1966\u20137). Bowie then formed the multimedia folk trio Turquoise and recorded another single: \"Ching-a-Ling\" (written by Bowie) / \"Back To Where You've Never Been\" (written by Tony Hill). However, Hill left the band just after the recording. The trio continued for a while as Feathers with John 'Hutch' Hutchinson replacing Hill and joining Bowie and the other original member Hermione Farthingale. Hitch even redubbed Hill's vocals in \"Ching-a-Ling\". However, Farthingale left in January 1969 and they had no record deal so the idea of the single was abandoned. Bowie and Hutch continued as a duo for a month or so, before Hutch moved away, and Bowie got a new record deal with Mercury on the basis of a Bowie and Hutch demo of \"Space Oddity\".<ref>Pegg, p. 156</ref><ref>Pegg, p. 132</ref><ref name=\"pegg62\" />\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_60s_c1}}{{Note|note_60s_c2}} \"Space Oddity\" and \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" were released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" UK edit was 3'52\"; while USA edit was 3'20\".

first appeared on ''David Bowie'' [aka ''Space Oddity''] (1969) and was over 7 minutes long. For this single, the song was re-recorded in two different parts. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" and \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" were not released in the USA but did have 7\" promo for radio promotion (not for general release). The versions of both songs were edits of the full recordings released in UK and other territories. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" [new version] was 4'02\" in UK, and 3'18\" for the American promo. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" [new version] was 3'34\" in UK, and 2'22\" for the American promo.\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_70s_b1}} Bowie's \"Holy Holy\" single in the UK was not planned for release in the USA. Instead, the next American single would be \"All the Madmen\". For the release, the album track was seriously edited, most significantly having the middle section taken out. There is also some debate as to if the single was actually released. However, collector Jens D\u00f6pke writes the single went out but had \u2018poor sales, so that most existing records ended up in the cut-out bins\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=D\u00f6pke|first=Jens|website=David Bowie \u2013 Just Another Collection|url=http://www.bowie-collection.de/|title=1970\u20131974}}</ref> These singles 'have a drill hole through the label to show that it had been discounted after not selling for full price'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bowie-singles.com/USA/All_The_Madmen.html|title=David Bowie 7\" Singles|website=|access-date=}}</ref> \n* '''c'''{{Note|note_70s_c1}}{{Note|note_70s_c2}} After the Arnold Corns \"Moonage Daydream\" / \"Hang On to Yourself\" single in May 1971, another Arnold Corns single was recorded on 17 June 1971: \"Looking For a Friend\" / \"Man In The Middle\". \"Looking For a Friend\" was written by Bowie, and sung by band members and friends Mark Pritchard, Mick Ronson, and Mickey King along with Bowie. \"Man In The Middle\" was written and sung by Pritchard. The single was never released. However, in the wake of the success of Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust period, B&C records (with whom Bowie had a limited deal for the Arnold Corns before signing for RCA with the ''Hunky Dory'' album [1971]), released an unofficial cash-in single: \"Hang On to Yourself\" / \"Man in the Middle\" \u2013 the A Side taken from the B Side of the first official Arnold Corns single, along with the Pritchard track from the second recording session.\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_70s_d1}} The \"Changes\" B Side in USA and Canada was an edited version of \"Andy Warhol\", with the studio chatter at the beginning edited out. In France, the original edition of the single had another ''Hunky Dory'' track for the B Side, 'Song for Bob Dylan', but was soon replaced by \"Andy Warhol\" [chatterless version]. All other editions had the full album version of \"Andy Warhol\" on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 24</ref> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_70s_e1}}{{Note|note_70s_e2}} \"Changes\" did not chart in 1972 in UK and Australia, but following Bowie's death in 2016 the song entered these charts peaking at No. 49 (UK) and No. 80 (Australia).\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_70s_f1}} \"Changes\" was actually released in the USA (and Canada) in December 1971. While the single peaked at No. 66 in 1972, it re-entered the chart in 1974, peaking at No. 41.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_70s_g1}} The mix of \"Starman\" used for the single differs from the album version in that the 'morse code' sounds of the song are higher in the mix. USA and German versions of the song were edited. The USA edit removes some of the opening bars of the song, the German edit fades early.\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_70s_h1}}{{Note|note_70s_h2}} The Italian and Spanish versions of the \"Starman\" single were issued much later in the year, and have the A Side of the next official single \u2013 \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" \u2013 on the B Side. The Portuguese single is an EP with both \"Starman\" [A1] and \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [B1] with \"Hang On To Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] [A2] (the B Side of the general release of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\") and \"Suffragette City\" [B2] (the B Side of the general release of \"Starman\").\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_70s_i1}} In late January 1972 \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" was re-recorded during the second ''Aladdin Sane'' album session for inclusion on that album. In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\">Pegg, p. 142-3</ref>\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_70s_j1}} \"The Jean Genie\" was released in UK on November 1972, but in the USA during October. The USA version of the single had \"Hang On to Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] on the B Side. Releases across the world occurred between November 1972 and February 1973, with different territories having one of these two B Sides. Except Japan (January 1973), which had \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [original version] on the B Side.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_70s_k1}}{{Note|note_70s_k2}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was released in a few other territories (Canada, Spain, Australia, etc.) with the same B Side as the USA release. It was also released in Mexico and Puru \u2013 in Mexico with \"Starman\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side; and in Puru in a slightly edited version (omitting part of the intro) with \"The Jean Genie\" (from ''Aladdin Sane'') on the B Side. In Japan, the single was released in March (just prior to Bowie's Japanese tour in April) with \"It Ain't Easy\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side.\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_70s_l1}}{{Note|note_70s_l2}} \"Drive-In Saturday\" was released in April 1973, but not in the US and Canada, who instead had the release of the \"Time\" single (edited version). \"Drive-In Saturday\" in Germany was released in an edited version \u2013 the only territory to so. Both \"Drive-In Saturday\" and \"Time\" (USA edit) were released in France, \"Drive-In Saturday\" in April, \"Time\" in July.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_70s_m1}} \"Round and Round\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_70s_n1}} \"The Prettiest Star\" [''Aladdin Sane'' version] was the B Side for the \"Time\" single in most of the limited number of territories it was released in, except for Japan, where the B Side was another track from ''Aladdin Sane'', \"Panic in Detroit\".\n* '''o'''{{Note|note_70s_o1}} \"Life on Mars?\" was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''p'''{{Note|note_70s_p1}} The B Side of \"Life on Mars?\" was in most territories it was released in \"The Man Who Sold the World\". In Spain the B Side was \"Drive-In Saturday\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in Portugal \"Black Country Rock\" (from ''The Man Who Sold the World''); and in Italy \"Amsterdam\", recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971. \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_70s_q1}} \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" was a release focused upon the US, and was not released in the UK (where \"Life on Mars?\" was released during the same month instead).\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_70s_r1}} The B Side to \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" in Italy was \"Watch That Man\" and in Japan \"Drive-In Saturday\", both from ''Aladdin Sane''.\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_70s_s1}} \"The Laughing Gnome\" had some different B Sides in some territories: \"Silly Boy Blue\" in Netherlands and West Germany; \"Rubber Band\" (album version) in Italy and Spain. These tracks are taken from the contemporaneous album ''David Bowie'' (1967).\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_70s_t1}} The B Side of \"Sorrow\" had \"Amsterdam\" on the B Side in all territories except Spain, where it was \"Lady Grinning Soul\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in South Africa, however, it was mis-titled \"Port of Amsterdam\". \"Amsterdam\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971 (along with the B Side to \"Drive-In Saturday\", \"Round and Round\"), and had already appeared on the B Side to the \"Life on Mars?\" single in Italy earlier in the year.\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_70s_u1}}{{Note|note_70s_u2}} The original single mix of \"Rebel Rebel\" was released in February 1974 and is just a slightly early fade of the album version. It appeared in the UK, USA and most RCA territories. In April 1974 \u2013 in a move reminiscent of what happened with the rerecorded version of the \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" single in the UK \u2013 \"Rebel Rebel\" was heavily remixed and overdubbed in New York, and appeared on single again in the US and Canada the following month with a different B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 222</ref> The Brazilian version of the single uses the album version and has \"Diamond Dogs\" (from the album of the same name) on the B Side. In November \"Rebel Rebel\" was released again in Australia, this time as an EP: the A Side had \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Queen Bitch\" as per the single release; while the B Side was essentially the \"Sorrow\" single from the previous year, with \"Sorrow\" and \"Amsterdam\".\n* '''v'''{{Note|note_70s_v1}} \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" was only released in the UK and a few other territories, not in the USA.\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_70s_w1}} \"Diamond Dogs\" was issued in the UK and limited territories, it was not issued in the USA or Canada. The version in all these territories was the album mix, except in Australia where there was an exceptionally short edit of 2'58\" (as opposed to approx. 6').\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_70s_x1}} \"Holy Holy\" had originally been a single for Bowie back in 1971. In mid to late 1972, during the earliest days of recording songs for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' Bowie recorded this new version of the song for the album. It was never used. Very much like the B Sides to the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\") and \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\").\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_70s_y1}}{{Note|note_70s_y2}}{{Note|note_70s_y3}} The \"1984\" single had very limited release. In the US and New Zealand, the single had \"Queen Bitch\" on the B Side, in Japan only \"Lady Grinning Soul\".\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_70s_z1}}{{Note|note_70s_z2}}{{Note|note_70s_z3}} \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live] was originally a non-album track, as the original version of the album issued in 1974 did not feature the song. The album was issued again in 1990 with additional tracks, and a second time in 2005 with more additional tracks, one of which was \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live]. See Live Albums \u2013 Re-Issues on this page for more information.\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_70s_aa1}}{{Note|note_70s_aa2}} \"Young Americans\" was only released in its full album version (5'10\")in the UK. In all other territories, it was released in a single edit (3'15\") which edited out some of the verses later in the song.\n* '''bb'''{{Note|note_70s_bb1}} The 1975 release of the \"Space Oddity\" single was focused on the UK (i.e., no USA etc. release). It was, however, also released in Netherlands later in the year, and in Yugoslavia but with only \"Velvet Goldmine\" on the B Side. \"Velvet Goldmine\" was a song originally recorded for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' but never made it to the final tracklist. It is one of the many tracks from the recording session in late 1971 which ended up as B Sides over the following years, along with the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\"), \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\") and \"Diamond Dogs\" with \"Holy Holy\" [rerecorded version].\n* '''cc'''{{Note|note_70s_cc1}} \"TVC 15\" [single edit] was also supposed to appear as the B Sides to a 'radical 3'40\" edit' of the \"Station to Station\" song (from the album of the same name) 'mooted [as a] single in France'. The single was never released, although a few copies were pressed.<ref>Pegg, p. 267</ref>\n* '''dd'''{{Note|note_70s_dd1}}{{Note|note_70s_dd2}} \"Stay\" came out as both an A Side and a B Side in the same month \u2013 July 1976. It came out as a B Side to the official retrospective single \"Suffragette City\" in the UK (and some other territories) where the ''ChangesOneBowie'' compilation was being promoted; and as an A Side in the USA (and some other territories) where the compilation album was not being prompted. In addition, \"Stay\" appears in two formats: the album version (6'16\") and single edit (3'23). The \"Suffragette City\" single had the album version on the B Side (except in Germany); while the \"Stay\" single used the edited version in all the territories where it was released.\n* '''ee'''{{Note|note_70s_ee1}} \"Suffragette City\" while an official retrospective single released 9 July 1976, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesOneBowie]]'' compilation released on 21 May 1976. Both compilation and single were focused upon the UK market. The album was also released in some other territories, such as West Germany, but not the USA. Similarly, the \"Suffragette City\" single was not released in the US, but did see release in West Germany, France, and Australia.\n* '''ff'''{{Note|note_70s_ff1}} USA Promo only. Bowie's first 12\" single. Except, not really... Nic Pegg writes: 'In an unusual experiment, a 12\" promo issued in American 1977 featured a seven-minute remix consisting of \"Sound and Vision\" segueing into [[Iggy Pop]]'s \"[[The Idiot (album)|Sister Midnight]]\".'<ref>Pegg, p. 254</ref>\n* '''gg'''{{Note|note_70s_gg1}}{{Note|note_70s_gg2}}{{Note|note_70s_gg3}} The \"'Heroes'\" song was also recorded in German and French language versions (translated by Antonia Maass [aka Maa\u00df]). The single version worldwide was an edited cut of the album version, but was released in both Germany and France in two formats: in the original English and in the respective languages. In Germany, the German language version appeared as a single titled \"'Helden'\"; while in France the French language version was still titled \"'Heroes'\" but had 'Chant\u00e9 en Fran\u00e7ais' on the cover (the English language single had 'Version Anglaise' on the cover). The \"'Heroes'\" album was also released in Germany and France with the song \"'Heroes'\" (full length version) in different language versions. These versions have half the song sang in English, and half in the respective languages. These versions of the song are known as: \"'Heroes'\" / \"'Helden'\" [Long English/German version] and \"'Heroes'\" / \"'H\u00e9ros'\" [Long English/French version].\n* '''hh'''{{Note|note_70s_hh1}} Spain only 12\" and David Bowie's first commercially available 12\". There had been a USA promo 12\" for the \"Sound and Vision\" single \u2013 although this was just \"Sound and Vision\" segueing into Iggy Pop's \"Sister Midnight\" song. And there was also a USA promo 12\" for \"'Heroes'\", with the full album version on the A Side and the single edit on the B Side. The 12\" single commercially released for \"'Heroes'\", however, was only released in Spain.\n* '''ii'''{{Note|note_70s_ii1}} Spain only 12\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" was David Bowie's second commercially available 12\" \u2013 both of which were Spanish releases (the first being the previous single \"'Heroes'\"). However, this 12\" was also released in the US as a promo: labelled as the 'Disco Version'.\n* '''jj'''{{Note|note_70s_jj1}}{{Note|note_70s_jj2}} This release of \"Breaking Glass\" is an Australian only single \u2013 the first time Bowie had released a single in Australia and nowhere else. The song is an extended version of \"Breaking Glass\" from the ''Low'' album. The B Side \u2013 \"Art Decade\" \u2013 also comes from ''Low''. Interestingly, the labels on the actual record say that both songs come from the live album ''Stage''. They do not.<ref>http://www.bowie-singles.com/OZNZ/Breaking_Glass.html</ref> It is, however, worth noting that a few months earlier in late 1978 Bowie had released a 7\" single in the UK and some other European territories with \"Breaking Glass\" [live] from ''Stage'' on the A Side and \"Art Decade\" [Live] as well as \"Ziggy Stardust\" [Live] both also from ''Stage'' on the B Side.\n* '''kk'''{{Note|note_70s_kk1}} Netherlands only 12\" of \"Boys Keep Swinging\". Collector Jens D\u00f6pke writes: 'At this time, the concept of 12\" singles was spreading... The versions of the tracks on it [\"Boys Keep Swinging\" 12\"] are the same as on the 7\" singles and the album. It wasn't yet self-evident that a 12\" ought to contain longer and/or different mixes.'<ref name=\"bowie-collection.de\"/>\n* '''ll'''{{Note|note_70s_ll1}}{{Note|note_70s_ll2}} \"Yassassin\" was released in Turkey and also Netherlands as a single instead of the \"D.J.\" single. In Turkey the full album track was used, and the title appeared on the sleeve as \"Yassassin (Ya\u015fasin)\". In Netherlands, an edited version of the album track was released. The singles had different B Sides.\n* '''mm'''{{Note|note_70s_mm1}} \"Look Back in Anger\" was a USA only single. Nic Pegg claims that it replaced \"Boys Keep Swinging\". However, the latter track was released in the UK and other territories (not USA) in April 1979, while \"Look Back in Anger\" was released in the States long after, in August 1979. This was after both the UK and the States had seen the single \"D.J.\" in June.<ref>Pegg, p. 170</ref>\n* '''nn'''{{Note|note_70s_nn1}} Japanese only single \u2013 Bowie's first.

The studio version was thus recorded prior to the recording of the ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' album which began in September 1978.<ref>Pegg, p. 17</ref> \n* '''b'''{{Note|note_80s_b}} This version \u2013 the third \u2013 of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for a special of ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' titled Will ''Kenny Everett Make It To 1980?'' broadcast on New Year's Eve 1979. It is a slight remix which 'notably extends the deafening silence after the line \"may God's love be with you\" by a full three-and-a-half seconds'.<ref>Pegg, p. 259</ref> The first version of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for the video film ''[[Love You till Tuesday (film)|Love You till Tuesday]]'' in early 1969. It is the second version of the song that has been released as a single many times, beginning late 1969 and providing Bowie with his first UK hit. This version appears on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' [USA 1969\u20131972] and ''Space Oddity'' [worldwide 1972\u20132009].\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_80s_c}} \"Crystal Japan\" was a Japanese only single, Bowie's second, following \"Revolutionary Song\" of the previous year. The song was originally to be the closing track of ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' and was titled \"Fujimoto San\". It was, however, dropped and replaced during the recording process. The song was instead used in 1980 on a Japanese television commercial for a sake brand called Crystal Jun Rock. Bowie also appeared in the commercial. \n* '''d'''{{Note|note_80s_d1}}{{Note|note_80s_d2}} The \"Ashes to Ashes\" 12\" appeared only in the US and Germany. In the USA it appeared under the title ''The Continuing Story of Major Tom''. On the A Side Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" song from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), which was a hit in the US in early 1973, segues into the single edit of \"Ashes to Ashes\". The German 12\" has the 'Disco mix' on the A Side, which is just the full length version of the song as on the album ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]''.<ref name=\"David Bowie 12 Singles\"/> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_80s_e}} Did not enter the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 but peaked at No. 101 on the [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn\" />\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_80s_f}} The \"Fashion\" 12\" was issued in UK, Germany and the USA only.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_80s_g}} \"It's No Game (Part 1)\" was a Japanese only single, replacing the release of \"Fashion\" in rest of world (which appears on the B Side). This made a lot of sense as the song features Japanese vocals from Hisahi Miura. The song appears here as it does in the US as \"It's No Game (Part 1)\", although in the UK on the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album it is called \"It's No Game (No. 1)\".\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_80s_h}} The \"Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)\" 12\" was issued only in Germany.\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_80s_i}} The \"Up the Hill Backwards\" 12\" was issued only in the US, which did not see the release of a 7\". This is because both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather limited release had the same edit of the song, taken from the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album.\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_80s_j}} The \"Under Pressure\" 12\" was issued only in Netherlands, which also saw the release of a 7\". Both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather unusually used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_80s_k}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" is the album cut in all single versions. The song runs at 5'58\" on all these records, however, a special edit was created running at 3'34\" for the music video.<ref>Pegg, p. 315</ref>\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_80s_l}} The \"Wild Is the Wind\" 12\" was issued only in the UK and Germany (both of which also saw the release of a 7\"). Again, as with the previous \"Up the Hill Backwards\" and \"Under Pressure\" singles, both 7\" and 12\" versions used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_80s_m}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" while an official retrospective single released 13 November 1981, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesTwoBowie]]'' compilation released the same month. The album and single were focused upon UK and Europe. No single went out in the USA.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_80s_n}} Aka ''David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal''. These songs were originally recorded by Bowie in August 1981 for a BBC television version of ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]''. In September 1981, Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]] went to the Hansa studios in Berlin to re-record the five songs for this single release. The single came out in February 1982 just prior to the TV film broadcast on 2 March 1982. \n* '''o'''{{Note|note_80s_o}} While the ''Baal'' release featured five tracks, the ''de facto'' lead song was \"The Drowned Girl\" for which a music video was made, directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]. \n* '''p'''{{Note|note_80s_p}} ''Baal'' was only issued as a 7\" EP in the UK, everywhere else it came out as a 12\". \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_80s_q1}}{{Note|note_80s_q2}}{{Note|note_80s_q3}}{{Note|note_80s_q4}} This original recording of the song \"\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" appeared commercially in three versions. The album version ran at 6'08\" and it was this that appeared on the standard 12\" releases (as well as the Portugal 7\"). The standard 7\" single version of the track was an edit running at 4'08\". In Australia, a special extended remix was released running at 9'20 with 'added saxophone and synthesiser'. In addition, there were various promo edits and a USA DJ edit of the album version, varying between 3'08\" and 5'32\".<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\">Pegg, p. 57</ref>\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_80s_r}} The \"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\" single was lifted from a Bowie guest spot on ''[[Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas]]'' from 1977. And while an official retrospective release by his record company at the time (RCA), Bowie was not happy about the release and it was essentially unsanctioned: 'a piece of opportunism which did little to improve Bowie's relationship with his soon-to-be-former label'.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\"/>\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_80s_s1}}{{Note|note_80s_s2}} The Brazilian single edit of \"Let's Dance\" was not standard single edit, but the album version with an early fade. There was also a USA DJ version of the song, named the 'extended edit', so longer than the standard single edit, but shorter than the full album version.\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_80s_t1}}{{Note|note_80s_t2}}{{Note|note_80s_t3}} The live version of \"Modern Love\" that appeared as the B Side to all \"Modern Love\" singles was a live version of the song recorded on the second night at the Forum de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada (13 July 1983). The entire concert was recorded and, with the exception of \"Breaking Glass\", \"Golden Years\", \"TVC-15\" and \"Stay\", broadcast on American FM radio in the series 'Supergroups in Concert'. At the time \"Modern Love\" [live] was a non-album track (it has however later appeared on both the ''[[Serious Moonlight (1983 film)|Serious Moonlight]]'' live DVD reissue [2006] as an audio only extra and been included on the album of the same name [2018] as its final track \u2013 although the film was recorded at the Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, Canada on 12 September 1983).\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"This Is Not America\" was issued in both 7\" and 12\" in UK and some other territories, but both releases had the same versions of the same songs on both the A Side and B Side. In some territories only the 7\" was issued \u2013 such as the USA. There was also, however, an extended mix issued in America on a various artists 12\" via DJ subscription only label Disconet.<ref>Pegg, p. 280</ref>\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"Absolute Beginners\" also exists in a shorter edited version (4'46\") that that of the single (5'40'), issued on the A Side of an American promo 12\", with the full version on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 14</ref>\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_80s_w1}} \"Magic Dance\" was only released in a very limited number of territories, most prominently the USA. Furthermore, while a single edit was prepared from both the album track and the dance mix, these were never used and the release only came out on 12\".\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_80s_x1}} With \"Day-In Day-Out\" Bowie begins issuing multiple remixes: '[a]lthough several previous singles had spawned 12\" versions, \"Day-In Day-Out\" marked Bowie's first major incursion into the brave new world of multi-format releases and endless remixes\".<ref>Pegg, p. 71</ref> The major UK and worldwide releases were 12\" 1 led by the 'extended dance mix' and 12\" 2 led by the remix [aka Groucho mix]. In USA 12\" 2 was replaced by a slightly different version which included the single edit and replaced the 'extended dub mix' with the 'extended dance mix'. There was also a US promo which had '7\" Dance Edit' [A1]; 'Extended Dub Mix' [B1]; and Edited Dance Mix [B2]. There were also some other local variations of 12\"s, including Germany and Brazil. Bowie also re-recorded the vocals in Spanish the song becoming known as ''Al Alba' and 'Dia Tras Dia'', although it was only played on the radio in Spain once and was not originally released as a single.<ref>Pegg, p. 72</ref>\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_80s_y1}} \"Under the God\" 10\" UK only.\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_80s_z1}} ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' double A side single was only released in UK and Japan. Despite the song \"Tin Machine\" appearing on the label as 'A' for 7\" and 12\", and '1' for the CD, as well as the back sleeves track listings putting \"Tin Machine\" at the top, the front cover of the single listed \"Maggie's Farm [live]\" before \"Tin Machine\", and the single was promoted with a video of \"Maggie's Farm [live]\".\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_80s_aa1}} The Japanese CD version of ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' had a fifth extra track - \"The Interview\" [an interview with the band].

In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\"/>\n* '''b''' {{Note|video_singles_b}} The \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" video was made for BBC's Top of the Pops to be shown while Bowie was away touring in the USA. However, it went unboradcast. Reasons include the sexual nature of some of the images in the video, and that - given this was the earliest days of the music video - Bowie's manager Tony Defries wanted to charge the BBC what they saw as exorbitant fee.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 143\"/>\n* '''c''' {{Note|video_singles_c}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was however released in a few other territories: Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Puru and Japan.\n* '''d''' {{Note|video_singles_d}} \"Space Oddity\" was recorded twice in 1969. The first version was recorded on 2 February during the making of the music video film ''Love You Till Tuesday'', and consequently had a contemporaneous video made for it (see 'Music video films', below). The second version was recorded between 20\u201323 June, and it is this version that was released as a single a few weeks later, and featured on the album ''David Bowie'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' (USA 1969\u20131972) aka ''Space Oddity'' (worldwide 1972\u20132009). This single did not have a video made for it at the time.\n* '''e''' {{Note|video_singles_e}} The \"Space Oddity\" single in 1969 was generally released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". European versions of the single were the full-length album recording (5'10). \n* '''f''' {{Note|video_singles_f}} \"Life on Mars?\" was released in the UK and a limited number of other territories. It was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''g''' {{Note|video_singles_g}} There is also another rough cut version of the \"'Heroes'\" music video, sometimes known as the 'alternative take' or - more accurately, 'take 1'. 'The \u201cHeroes\u201d promo outtakes reel is just under 28 minutes long. It contains one complete take, and 8 partial takes of \u201cHeroes\u201d [...] The official promo for \u201cHeroes\u201d utilizes sections from most of the takes, in long cross dissolves. The only complete take of \u201cHeroes\u201d, Take 1, was barely used \u2013 all that was included was the 10 seconds of \u201cI would be king, and you, you would be queen\u201d [...] The complete Take 1 [...] includes many full-face close-ups of Bowie [... and] was largely unused due to the fact that Bowie's miming in it was not very accurate [...] since the promo was for immediate use \u2013 we see it included on the \u201cL\u2019Altra Domenica\u201d show a few days later \u2013 perhaps there was no time for a very sophisticated edit.' As this source notes regarding the tape: 'In addition, there are a couple of takes of about 30 seconds of Blackout. And about 3 minutes of close-ups of Bowie slowly bringing his hand to his face, mimicking the \u201cHeroes\u201d album cover whilst Sense of Doubt plays in the background. It seems there was no intention of creating promos for the latter two songs; the footage was merely to be used in the two TV commercials for the \u201cHeroes\u201d album.' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCGT0Fl9FQ|title=Nacho on David Bowie's Heroes video|website=YouTube|access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-heroes-video-anniversary-new-edit-nachos-videos-2550651|title=David Bowie's Heroes video|website=NME|access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n|}\n\n====Posthumous music video singles====\n\nA number of music video singles have been produced since Bowie's death, by directors who have been given permission by Bowie's estate and / or record company.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:1em;\" | Year\n!

Bowie also released 14 video albums and 72 music videos.\n\nBowie's debut release was the 1964 single \"[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]\" by Davie Jones & the King Bees. He released two more singles in 1965 under the names of The Manish Boys and Davy Jones & the Lower Third. His first release using the name David Bowie was the 1966 single \"[[Can't Help Thinking About Me]]\", which was released with The Lower Third. Bowie's next single, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\", also released in 1966, was the first release by simply David Bowie. Bowie released four more singles and his debut album, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', but the first success in the United Kingdom was with the 1969 single \"[[Space Oddity]]\". The single reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after it was released five days before the [[Apollo 11]] moon mission.<ref name=\"guinness\">Roberts, David (editor) (2006) [1977].

London: [[HiT Entertainment]]. pp. 72\u201373, 560. {{ISBN|1-904994-10-5}}.</ref>\n\nBowie released three more albums&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971)&nbsp;\u2013 before he eventually made it on to the [[UK Albums Chart]] with ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), which peaked at number five. Following the success of ''Ziggy Stardust'', sales of ''Hunky Dory'' improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. [[RCA Records|RCA]] re-released the 1969'' David Bowie''  under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'', which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively (but the last one reached number 21 after the Bowie'death in 2016).\nBowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (1973), ''[[Pin Ups]]'' (1973), ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974) and ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' (1980) reached the number one position. His 1975 RCA album \"[[Young Americans]]\" included his first #1 US single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" <https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6700699/david-bowie-fame-no-1-hot-100-1975-rewinding-charts>which was co-written by [[John Lennon]], who also performed on the album, and Carlos Alomar. He then released three solo studio albums with [[EMI]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), whose [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] became his first single to reach number one in both the United Kingdom and the United States, ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984) and ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' (1987). ''Let's Dance'' and ''Tonight'' reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while ''Never Let Me Down'' reached number six. The success of ''Let's Dance'' revitalized Bowie's back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. This peaked on 16 July that year, with ten entries \u2013 a figure bettered only by [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>*Roberts, David.

Bowie released a further seven studio albums, all of which have reached the top ten in the UK.

These dates must be incorrect because Bowie played The Tower Theater for six nights, from 8 July to 13 July. D\u00f6pke goes on to say: \"On later pressings, this error has been corrected (although the new dates given, 12-13/07/1974, are still not entirely correct).\" D\u00f6pke notes the corrected pressings begin from October 1974, which given the first pressing was released on 21 October 1974, the mistake must have been realised and corrected during the run up to release. The correct dates of the recording, according to D\u00f6pke, are 10-13/07/1974.<ref name=\"bowie-collection.de\">http://www.bowie-collection.de/</ref>\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_live_b}} There were some overdubs recorded in post-production (before mixing) for ''David Live''. Nic Pegg writes 'The backing vocals and some of the saxophone parts were re-recorded at Record Plant because, according to [Tony] Visconti [who supervised the post-production and mixed the album], \"the backing singers and horn players were often sporadically off microphone due to excitement, I guess.\" Similarly, Mike Garson re-recorded his piano solo for \"Aladdin Sane\" because \"the original was wiped. It was only 16-track so I guess that was the only way it could be done then\".' <ref name=\"Pegg, p. 373\"/>\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_live_c}} According to Nic Pegg, Tony Visconti, who was recording and mixing the album, thought 'many of the numbers too fast after the first night's recording in Philadelphia, and the band re-rehearsed on the afternoon of 29 April to re-establish the original studio tempi. So consistent were the band's performances thereafter, explained Victonti, \"that we were able to use the intro and outro of 'Station to Station' from Boston and the bulk from Rhode Island\".' It is thus unlikely any of the recordings from the 28th April were used on the final album.<ref>Pegg, p. 393</ref>\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_live_d}} An early mix of the sound was created by Ken Scott in 1973, and it was this that was used for the [[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (film)|film]] soundtrack in early broadcasts and screenings. In 1981, Bowie and producer Tony Visconti prepared a new mix for both the release of the film and the release of an accompanying album. Nic Pegg writes: 'Visconti, who described the process as \"more of a salvage job than an artistic endeavour\", explained that \"the sound quality was poor and I was called in to beef it up, which also required David and me to resing many of the backing vocals. They were simply not recorded well on tape \u2013 partly because Trevor Bolder and Mick Ronson didn't sing into the microphones!\"'. In addition, two songs featured Jeff Beck on guitar: \"The Jean Genie / Love Me Do\" medley and \"Round and Round\". Beck redid his solos in December 1981 at CTS Studios, London. However, in the end Beck refused to allow the two songs to be included in the soundtrack (and, of course, in the film).<ref>Pegg, p. 404-5</ref>\n* '''e'''{{Note|note_live_e1}}{{Note|note_live_e2}} The songs on the ''Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby'' album came from a number of shows in the US and Japan: 20 November 1991 in Boston; 27 or 29 November 1991 in New York; 7 December 1991 in Chicago; 10 or 11 February 1992 in Sapporo; 17 February 1992 in Tokyo.\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_live_f}} The ''liveandwell.com'' album was a limited edition live release not available commercially but via subscribing to [[David Bowie#BowieNet|BowieNet]]. 'Although Bowie hoped for the album to have a full commercial release, his label Virgin was unenthusiastic and refused to issue it.' <ref>{{cite web|title=liveandWwll.com|url=https://www.bowiebible.com/albums/liveandwell-com/|website=Bowie Bible|accessdate=17 October 2019|language=en}}</ref> The album only features songs from the albums ''Earthling'' (1997) and ''1.

Furthermore, due to technological advances, the album was remixed for much improved sound.\n|-\n| 2016\n| LP / CD / DD\n| '''Who Can I Be Now? box set Editions'''<br />This boxset included remasters of both the original (1974) and EMI (2005) editions of the album, once again improving the sound for both.

Two previously unreleased performances were included on the album as bonus tracks (in addition to the bonus track on the 1991 Rykodisc reissue). The album was also remixed for improved sound.\n|-\n| 2017\n| LP / CD / DD\n| '''A New Career in a New Town box set Editions'''<br />This boxset included remasters of both the original (1978) and EMI (2005) editions of the album.

The remaster may also have had some of the overdubs removed or put much lower in the mix (sources vary on this), which were created for the 1983 version. \"The Jean Genie / Love Me Do\" medley and \"Round and Round\" encore with Jeff Beck are still omitted.

These were: \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" / \"Karma Man\" (recorded 1 September 1967) and \"In The Heat Of The Morning\" / \"London Bye Ta-Ta\" [1968 version] (recorded 12 March 1968). Both had a more mainstream pop feel than his previous baroque pop period (1966\u20137). Bowie then formed the multimedia folk trio Turquoise and recorded another single: \"Ching-a-Ling\" (written by Bowie) / \"Back To Where You've Never Been\" (written by Tony Hill). However, Hill left the band just after the recording. The trio continued for a while as Feathers with John 'Hutch' Hutchinson replacing Hill and joining Bowie and the other original member Hermione Farthingale. Hitch even redubbed Hill's vocals in \"Ching-a-Ling\". However, Farthingale left in January 1969 and they had no record deal so the idea of the single was abandoned. Bowie and Hutch continued as a duo for a month or so, before Hutch moved away, and Bowie got a new record deal with Mercury on the basis of a Bowie and Hutch demo of \"Space Oddity\".<ref>Pegg, p. 156</ref><ref>Pegg, p. 132</ref><ref name=\"pegg62\" />\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_60s_c1}}{{Note|note_60s_c2}} \"Space Oddity\" and \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" were released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" UK edit was 3'52\"; while USA edit was 3'20\".

first appeared on ''David Bowie'' [aka ''Space Oddity''] (1969) and was over 7 minutes long. For this single, the song was re-recorded in two different parts. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" and \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" were not released in the USA but did have 7\" promo for radio promotion (not for general release). The versions of both songs were edits of the full recordings released in UK and other territories. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" [new version] was 4'02\" in UK, and 3'18\" for the American promo. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" [new version] was 3'34\" in UK, and 2'22\" for the American promo.\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_70s_b1}} Bowie's \"Holy Holy\" single in the UK was not planned for release in the USA. Instead, the next American single would be \"All the Madmen\". For the release, the album track was seriously edited, most significantly having the middle section taken out. There is also some debate as to if the single was actually released. However, collector Jens D\u00f6pke writes the single went out but had \u2018poor sales, so that most existing records ended up in the cut-out bins\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=D\u00f6pke|first=Jens|website=David Bowie \u2013 Just Another Collection|url=http://www.bowie-collection.de/|title=1970\u20131974}}</ref> These singles 'have a drill hole through the label to show that it had been discounted after not selling for full price'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bowie-singles.com/USA/All_The_Madmen.html|title=David Bowie 7\" Singles|website=|access-date=}}</ref> \n* '''c'''{{Note|note_70s_c1}}{{Note|note_70s_c2}} After the Arnold Corns \"Moonage Daydream\" / \"Hang On to Yourself\" single in May 1971, another Arnold Corns single was recorded on 17 June 1971: \"Looking For a Friend\" / \"Man In The Middle\". \"Looking For a Friend\" was written by Bowie, and sung by band members and friends Mark Pritchard, Mick Ronson, and Mickey King along with Bowie. \"Man In The Middle\" was written and sung by Pritchard. The single was never released. However, in the wake of the success of Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust period, B&C records (with whom Bowie had a limited deal for the Arnold Corns before signing for RCA with the ''Hunky Dory'' album [1971]), released an unofficial cash-in single: \"Hang On to Yourself\" / \"Man in the Middle\" \u2013 the A Side taken from the B Side of the first official Arnold Corns single, along with the Pritchard track from the second recording session.\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_70s_d1}} The \"Changes\" B Side in USA and Canada was an edited version of \"Andy Warhol\", with the studio chatter at the beginning edited out. In France, the original edition of the single had another ''Hunky Dory'' track for the B Side, 'Song for Bob Dylan', but was soon replaced by \"Andy Warhol\" [chatterless version]. All other editions had the full album version of \"Andy Warhol\" on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 24</ref> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_70s_e1}}{{Note|note_70s_e2}} \"Changes\" did not chart in 1972 in UK and Australia, but following Bowie's death in 2016 the song entered these charts peaking at No. 49 (UK) and No. 80 (Australia).\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_70s_f1}} \"Changes\" was actually released in the USA (and Canada) in December 1971. While the single peaked at No. 66 in 1972, it re-entered the chart in 1974, peaking at No. 41.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_70s_g1}} The mix of \"Starman\" used for the single differs from the album version in that the 'morse code' sounds of the song are higher in the mix. USA and German versions of the song were edited. The USA edit removes some of the opening bars of the song, the German edit fades early.\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_70s_h1}}{{Note|note_70s_h2}} The Italian and Spanish versions of the \"Starman\" single were issued much later in the year, and have the A Side of the next official single \u2013 \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" \u2013 on the B Side. The Portuguese single is an EP with both \"Starman\" [A1] and \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [B1] with \"Hang On To Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] [A2] (the B Side of the general release of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\") and \"Suffragette City\" [B2] (the B Side of the general release of \"Starman\").\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_70s_i1}} In late January 1972 \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" was re-recorded during the second ''Aladdin Sane'' album session for inclusion on that album. In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\">Pegg, p. 142-3</ref>\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_70s_j1}} \"The Jean Genie\" was released in UK on November 1972, but in the USA during October. The USA version of the single had \"Hang On to Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] on the B Side. Releases across the world occurred between November 1972 and February 1973, with different territories having one of these two B Sides. Except Japan (January 1973), which had \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [original version] on the B Side.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_70s_k1}}{{Note|note_70s_k2}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was released in a few other territories (Canada, Spain, Australia, etc.) with the same B Side as the USA release. It was also released in Mexico and Puru \u2013 in Mexico with \"Starman\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side; and in Puru in a slightly edited version (omitting part of the intro) with \"The Jean Genie\" (from ''Aladdin Sane'') on the B Side. In Japan, the single was released in March (just prior to Bowie's Japanese tour in April) with \"It Ain't Easy\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side.\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_70s_l1}}{{Note|note_70s_l2}} \"Drive-In Saturday\" was released in April 1973, but not in the US and Canada, who instead had the release of the \"Time\" single (edited version). \"Drive-In Saturday\" in Germany was released in an edited version \u2013 the only territory to so. Both \"Drive-In Saturday\" and \"Time\" (USA edit) were released in France, \"Drive-In Saturday\" in April, \"Time\" in July.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_70s_m1}} \"Round and Round\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_70s_n1}} \"The Prettiest Star\" [''Aladdin Sane'' version] was the B Side for the \"Time\" single in most of the limited number of territories it was released in, except for Japan, where the B Side was another track from ''Aladdin Sane'', \"Panic in Detroit\".\n* '''o'''{{Note|note_70s_o1}} \"Life on Mars?\" was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''p'''{{Note|note_70s_p1}} The B Side of \"Life on Mars?\" was in most territories it was released in \"The Man Who Sold the World\". In Spain the B Side was \"Drive-In Saturday\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in Portugal \"Black Country Rock\" (from ''The Man Who Sold the World''); and in Italy \"Amsterdam\", recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971. \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_70s_q1}} \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" was a release focused upon the US, and was not released in the UK (where \"Life on Mars?\" was released during the same month instead).\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_70s_r1}} The B Side to \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" in Italy was \"Watch That Man\" and in Japan \"Drive-In Saturday\", both from ''Aladdin Sane''.\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_70s_s1}} \"The Laughing Gnome\" had some different B Sides in some territories: \"Silly Boy Blue\" in Netherlands and West Germany; \"Rubber Band\" (album version) in Italy and Spain. These tracks are taken from the contemporaneous album ''David Bowie'' (1967).\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_70s_t1}} The B Side of \"Sorrow\" had \"Amsterdam\" on the B Side in all territories except Spain, where it was \"Lady Grinning Soul\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in South Africa, however, it was mis-titled \"Port of Amsterdam\". \"Amsterdam\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971 (along with the B Side to \"Drive-In Saturday\", \"Round and Round\"), and had already appeared on the B Side to the \"Life on Mars?\" single in Italy earlier in the year.\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_70s_u1}}{{Note|note_70s_u2}} The original single mix of \"Rebel Rebel\" was released in February 1974 and is just a slightly early fade of the album version. It appeared in the UK, USA and most RCA territories. In April 1974 \u2013 in a move reminiscent of what happened with the rerecorded version of the \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" single in the UK \u2013 \"Rebel Rebel\" was heavily remixed and overdubbed in New York, and appeared on single again in the US and Canada the following month with a different B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 222</ref> The Brazilian version of the single uses the album version and has \"Diamond Dogs\" (from the album of the same name) on the B Side. In November \"Rebel Rebel\" was released again in Australia, this time as an EP: the A Side had \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Queen Bitch\" as per the single release; while the B Side was essentially the \"Sorrow\" single from the previous year, with \"Sorrow\" and \"Amsterdam\".\n* '''v'''{{Note|note_70s_v1}} \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" was only released in the UK and a few other territories, not in the USA.\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_70s_w1}} \"Diamond Dogs\" was issued in the UK and limited territories, it was not issued in the USA or Canada. The version in all these territories was the album mix, except in Australia where there was an exceptionally short edit of 2'58\" (as opposed to approx. 6').\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_70s_x1}} \"Holy Holy\" had originally been a single for Bowie back in 1971. In mid to late 1972, during the earliest days of recording songs for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' Bowie recorded this new version of the song for the album. It was never used. Very much like the B Sides to the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\") and \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\").\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_70s_y1}}{{Note|note_70s_y2}}{{Note|note_70s_y3}} The \"1984\" single had very limited release. In the US and New Zealand, the single had \"Queen Bitch\" on the B Side, in Japan only \"Lady Grinning Soul\".\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_70s_z1}}{{Note|note_70s_z2}}{{Note|note_70s_z3}} \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live] was originally a non-album track, as the original version of the album issued in 1974 did not feature the song. The album was issued again in 1990 with additional tracks, and a second time in 2005 with more additional tracks, one of which was \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live]. See Live Albums \u2013 Re-Issues on this page for more information.\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_70s_aa1}}{{Note|note_70s_aa2}} \"Young Americans\" was only released in its full album version (5'10\")in the UK. In all other territories, it was released in a single edit (3'15\") which edited out some of the verses later in the song.\n* '''bb'''{{Note|note_70s_bb1}} The 1975 release of the \"Space Oddity\" single was focused on the UK (i.e., no USA etc. release). It was, however, also released in Netherlands later in the year, and in Yugoslavia but with only \"Velvet Goldmine\" on the B Side. \"Velvet Goldmine\" was a song originally recorded for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' but never made it to the final tracklist. It is one of the many tracks from the recording session in late 1971 which ended up as B Sides over the following years, along with the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\"), \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\") and \"Diamond Dogs\" with \"Holy Holy\" [rerecorded version].\n* '''cc'''{{Note|note_70s_cc1}} \"TVC 15\" [single edit] was also supposed to appear as the B Sides to a 'radical 3'40\" edit' of the \"Station to Station\" song (from the album of the same name) 'mooted [as a] single in France'. The single was never released, although a few copies were pressed.<ref>Pegg, p. 267</ref>\n* '''dd'''{{Note|note_70s_dd1}}{{Note|note_70s_dd2}} \"Stay\" came out as both an A Side and a B Side in the same month \u2013 July 1976. It came out as a B Side to the official retrospective single \"Suffragette City\" in the UK (and some other territories) where the ''ChangesOneBowie'' compilation was being promoted; and as an A Side in the USA (and some other territories) where the compilation album was not being prompted. In addition, \"Stay\" appears in two formats: the album version (6'16\") and single edit (3'23). The \"Suffragette City\" single had the album version on the B Side (except in Germany); while the \"Stay\" single used the edited version in all the territories where it was released.\n* '''ee'''{{Note|note_70s_ee1}} \"Suffragette City\" while an official retrospective single released 9 July 1976, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesOneBowie]]'' compilation released on 21 May 1976. Both compilation and single were focused upon the UK market. The album was also released in some other territories, such as West Germany, but not the USA. Similarly, the \"Suffragette City\" single was not released in the US, but did see release in West Germany, France, and Australia.\n* '''ff'''{{Note|note_70s_ff1}} USA Promo only. Bowie's first 12\" single. Except, not really... Nic Pegg writes: 'In an unusual experiment, a 12\" promo issued in American 1977 featured a seven-minute remix consisting of \"Sound and Vision\" segueing into [[Iggy Pop]]'s \"[[The Idiot (album)|Sister Midnight]]\".'<ref>Pegg, p. 254</ref>\n* '''gg'''{{Note|note_70s_gg1}}{{Note|note_70s_gg2}}{{Note|note_70s_gg3}} The \"'Heroes'\" song was also recorded in German and French language versions (translated by Antonia Maass [aka Maa\u00df]). The single version worldwide was an edited cut of the album version, but was released in both Germany and France in two formats: in the original English and in the respective languages. In Germany, the German language version appeared as a single titled \"'Helden'\"; while in France the French language version was still titled \"'Heroes'\" but had 'Chant\u00e9 en Fran\u00e7ais' on the cover (the English language single had 'Version Anglaise' on the cover). The \"'Heroes'\" album was also released in Germany and France with the song \"'Heroes'\" (full length version) in different language versions. These versions have half the song sang in English, and half in the respective languages. These versions of the song are known as: \"'Heroes'\" / \"'Helden'\" [Long English/German version] and \"'Heroes'\" / \"'H\u00e9ros'\" [Long English/French version].\n* '''hh'''{{Note|note_70s_hh1}} Spain only 12\" and David Bowie's first commercially available 12\". There had been a USA promo 12\" for the \"Sound and Vision\" single \u2013 although this was just \"Sound and Vision\" segueing into Iggy Pop's \"Sister Midnight\" song. And there was also a USA promo 12\" for \"'Heroes'\", with the full album version on the A Side and the single edit on the B Side. The 12\" single commercially released for \"'Heroes'\", however, was only released in Spain.\n* '''ii'''{{Note|note_70s_ii1}} Spain only 12\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" was David Bowie's second commercially available 12\" \u2013 both of which were Spanish releases (the first being the previous single \"'Heroes'\"). However, this 12\" was also released in the US as a promo: labelled as the 'Disco Version'.\n* '''jj'''{{Note|note_70s_jj1}}{{Note|note_70s_jj2}} This release of \"Breaking Glass\" is an Australian only single \u2013 the first time Bowie had released a single in Australia and nowhere else. The song is an extended version of \"Breaking Glass\" from the ''Low'' album. The B Side \u2013 \"Art Decade\" \u2013 also comes from ''Low''. Interestingly, the labels on the actual record say that both songs come from the live album ''Stage''. They do not.<ref>http://www.bowie-singles.com/OZNZ/Breaking_Glass.html</ref> It is, however, worth noting that a few months earlier in late 1978 Bowie had released a 7\" single in the UK and some other European territories with \"Breaking Glass\" [live] from ''Stage'' on the A Side and \"Art Decade\" [Live] as well as \"Ziggy Stardust\" [Live] both also from ''Stage'' on the B Side.\n* '''kk'''{{Note|note_70s_kk1}} Netherlands only 12\" of \"Boys Keep Swinging\".

The singles had different B Sides.\n* '''mm'''{{Note|note_70s_mm1}} \"Look Back in Anger\" was a USA only single. Nic Pegg claims that it replaced \"Boys Keep Swinging\". However, the latter track was released in the UK and other territories (not USA) in April 1979, while \"Look Back in Anger\" was released in the States long after, in August 1979.

July 1978 right at the end of the 1978 [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] (aka Low / Heroes Tour). The song had featured prominently and a live version from that tour would appear on the live album ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]''. The studio version was thus recorded prior to the recording of the ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' album which began in September 1978.<ref>Pegg, p. 17</ref> \n* '''b'''{{Note|note_80s_b}} This version \u2013 the third \u2013 of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for a special of ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' titled Will ''Kenny Everett Make It To 1980?'' broadcast on New Year's Eve 1979. It is a slight remix which 'notably extends the deafening silence after the line \"may God's love be with you\" by a full three-and-a-half seconds'.<ref>Pegg, p. 259</ref> The first version of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for the video film ''[[Love You till Tuesday (film)|Love You till Tuesday]]'' in early 1969. It is the second version of the song that has been released as a single many times, beginning late 1969 and providing Bowie with his first UK hit. This version appears on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' [USA 1969\u20131972] and ''Space Oddity'' [worldwide 1972\u20132009].\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_80s_c}} \"Crystal Japan\" was a Japanese only single, Bowie's second, following \"Revolutionary Song\" of the previous year. The song was originally to be the closing track of ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' and was titled \"Fujimoto San\". It was, however, dropped and replaced during the recording process. The song was instead used in 1980 on a Japanese television commercial for a sake brand called Crystal Jun Rock. Bowie also appeared in the commercial. \n* '''d'''{{Note|note_80s_d1}}{{Note|note_80s_d2}} The \"Ashes to Ashes\" 12\" appeared only in the US and Germany. In the USA it appeared under the title ''The Continuing Story of Major Tom''. On the A Side Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" song from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), which was a hit in the US in early 1973, segues into the single edit of \"Ashes to Ashes\". The German 12\" has the 'Disco mix' on the A Side, which is just the full length version of the song as on the album ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]''.<ref name=\"David Bowie 12 Singles\"/> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_80s_e}} Did not enter the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 but peaked at No. 101 on the [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn\" />\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_80s_f}} The \"Fashion\" 12\" was issued in UK, Germany and the USA only.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_80s_g}} \"It's No Game (Part 1)\" was a Japanese only single, replacing the release of \"Fashion\" in rest of world (which appears on the B Side). This made a lot of sense as the song features Japanese vocals from Hisahi Miura. The song appears here as it does in the US as \"It's No Game (Part 1)\", although in the UK on the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album it is called \"It's No Game (No. 1)\".\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_80s_h}} The \"Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)\" 12\" was issued only in Germany.\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_80s_i}} The \"Up the Hill Backwards\" 12\" was issued only in the US, which did not see the release of a 7\". This is because both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather limited release had the same edit of the song, taken from the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album.\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_80s_j}} The \"Under Pressure\" 12\" was issued only in Netherlands, which also saw the release of a 7\". Both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather unusually used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_80s_k}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" is the album cut in all single versions. The song runs at 5'58\" on all these records, however, a special edit was created running at 3'34\" for the music video.<ref>Pegg, p. 315</ref>\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_80s_l}} The \"Wild Is the Wind\" 12\" was issued only in the UK and Germany (both of which also saw the release of a 7\"). Again, as with the previous \"Up the Hill Backwards\" and \"Under Pressure\" singles, both 7\" and 12\" versions used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_80s_m}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" while an official retrospective single released 13 November 1981, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesTwoBowie]]'' compilation released the same month. The album and single were focused upon UK and Europe. No single went out in the USA.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_80s_n}} Aka ''David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal''. These songs were originally recorded by Bowie in August 1981 for a BBC television version of ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]''. In September 1981, Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]] went to the Hansa studios in Berlin to re-record the five songs for this single release. The single came out in February 1982 just prior to the TV film broadcast on 2 March 1982. \n* '''o'''{{Note|note_80s_o}} While the ''Baal'' release featured five tracks, the ''de facto'' lead song was \"The Drowned Girl\" for which a music video was made, directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]. \n* '''p'''{{Note|note_80s_p}} ''Baal'' was only issued as a 7\" EP in the UK, everywhere else it came out as a 12\". \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_80s_q1}}{{Note|note_80s_q2}}{{Note|note_80s_q3}}{{Note|note_80s_q4}} This original recording of the song \"\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" appeared commercially in three versions. The album version ran at 6'08\" and it was this that appeared on the standard 12\" releases (as well as the Portugal 7\"). The standard 7\" single version of the track was an edit running at 4'08\". In Australia, a special extended remix was released running at 9'20 with 'added saxophone and synthesiser'. In addition, there were various promo edits and a USA DJ edit of the album version, varying between 3'08\" and 5'32\".<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\">Pegg, p. 57</ref>\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_80s_r}} The \"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\" single was lifted from a Bowie guest spot on ''[[Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas]]'' from 1977. And while an official retrospective release by his record company at the time (RCA), Bowie was not happy about the release and it was essentially unsanctioned: 'a piece of opportunism which did little to improve Bowie's relationship with his soon-to-be-former label'.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\"/>\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_80s_s1}}{{Note|note_80s_s2}} The Brazilian single edit of \"Let's Dance\" was not standard single edit, but the album version with an early fade. There was also a USA DJ version of the song, named the 'extended edit', so longer than the standard single edit, but shorter than the full album version.\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_80s_t1}}{{Note|note_80s_t2}}{{Note|note_80s_t3}} The live version of \"Modern Love\" that appeared as the B Side to all \"Modern Love\" singles was a live version of the song recorded on the second night at the Forum de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada (13 July 1983). The entire concert was recorded and, with the exception of \"Breaking Glass\", \"Golden Years\", \"TVC-15\" and \"Stay\", broadcast on American FM radio in the series 'Supergroups in Concert'. At the time \"Modern Love\" [live] was a non-album track (it has however later appeared on both the ''[[Serious Moonlight (1983 film)|Serious Moonlight]]'' live DVD reissue [2006] as an audio only extra and been included on the album of the same name [2018] as its final track \u2013 although the film was recorded at the Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, Canada on 12 September 1983).\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"This Is Not America\" was issued in both 7\" and 12\" in UK and some other territories, but both releases had the same versions of the same songs on both the A Side and B Side. In some territories only the 7\" was issued \u2013 such as the USA. There was also, however, an extended mix issued in America on a various artists 12\" via DJ subscription only label Disconet.<ref>Pegg, p. 280</ref>\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"Absolute Beginners\" also exists in a shorter edited version (4'46\") that that of the single (5'40'), issued on the A Side of an American promo 12\", with the full version on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 14</ref>\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_80s_w1}} \"Magic Dance\" was only released in a very limited number of territories, most prominently the USA. Furthermore, while a single edit was prepared from both the album track and the dance mix, these were never used and the release only came out on 12\".\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_80s_x1}} With \"Day-In Day-Out\" Bowie begins issuing multiple remixes: '[a]lthough several previous singles had spawned 12\" versions, \"Day-In Day-Out\" marked Bowie's first major incursion into the brave new world of multi-format releases and endless remixes\".<ref>Pegg, p. 71</ref> The major UK and worldwide releases were 12\" 1 led by the 'extended dance mix' and 12\" 2 led by the remix [aka Groucho mix]. In USA 12\" 2 was replaced by a slightly different version which included the single edit and replaced the 'extended dub mix' with the 'extended dance mix'. There was also a US promo which had '7\" Dance Edit' [A1]; 'Extended Dub Mix' [B1]; and Edited Dance Mix [B2]. There were also some other local variations of 12\"s, including Germany and Brazil. Bowie also re-recorded the vocals in Spanish the song becoming known as ''Al Alba' and 'Dia Tras Dia'', although it was only played on the radio in Spain once and was not originally released as a single.<ref>Pegg, p. 72</ref>\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_80s_y1}} \"Under the God\" 10\" UK only.\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_80s_z1}} ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' double A side single was only released in UK and Japan. Despite the song \"Tin Machine\" appearing on the label as 'A' for 7\" and 12\", and '1' for the CD, as well as the back sleeves track listings putting \"Tin Machine\" at the top, the front cover of the single listed \"Maggie's Farm [live]\" before \"Tin Machine\", and the single was promoted with a video of \"Maggie's Farm [live]\".\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_80s_aa1}} The Japanese CD version of ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' had a fifth extra track - \"The Interview\" [an interview with the band].

In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\"/>\n* '''b''' {{Note|video_singles_b}} The \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" video was made for BBC's Top of the Pops to be shown while Bowie was away touring in the USA. However, it went unboradcast. Reasons include the sexual nature of some of the images in the video, and that - given this was the earliest days of the music video - Bowie's manager Tony Defries wanted to charge the BBC what they saw as exorbitant fee.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 143\"/>\n* '''c''' {{Note|video_singles_c}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was however released in a few other territories: Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Puru and Japan.\n* '''d''' {{Note|video_singles_d}} \"Space Oddity\" was recorded twice in 1969. The first version was recorded on 2 February during the making of the music video film ''Love You Till Tuesday'', and consequently had a contemporaneous video made for it (see 'Music video films', below). The second version was recorded between 20\u201323 June, and it is this version that was released as a single a few weeks later, and featured on the album ''David Bowie'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' (USA 1969\u20131972) aka ''Space Oddity'' (worldwide 1972\u20132009). This single did not have a video made for it at the time.\n* '''e''' {{Note|video_singles_e}} The \"Space Oddity\" single in 1969 was generally released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". European versions of the single were the full-length album recording (5'10). \n* '''f''' {{Note|video_singles_f}} \"Life on Mars?\" was released in the UK and a limited number of other territories. It was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''g''' {{Note|video_singles_g}} There is also another rough cut version of the \"'Heroes'\" music video, sometimes known as the 'alternative take' or - more accurately, 'take 1'. 'The \u201cHeroes\u201d promo outtakes reel is just under 28 minutes long. It contains one complete take, and 8 partial takes of \u201cHeroes\u201d [...] The official promo for \u201cHeroes\u201d utilizes sections from most of the takes, in long cross dissolves. The only complete take of \u201cHeroes\u201d, Take 1, was barely used \u2013 all that was included was the 10 seconds of \u201cI would be king, and you, you would be queen\u201d [...] The complete Take 1 [...] includes many full-face close-ups of Bowie [... and] was largely unused due to the fact that Bowie's miming in it was not very accurate [...] since the promo was for immediate use \u2013 we see it included on the \u201cL\u2019Altra Domenica\u201d show a few days later \u2013 perhaps there was no time for a very sophisticated edit.' As this source notes regarding the tape: 'In addition, there are a couple of takes of about 30 seconds of Blackout. And about 3 minutes of close-ups of Bowie slowly bringing his hand to his face, mimicking the \u201cHeroes\u201d album cover whilst Sense of Doubt plays in the background.

For his secondary education, he attended [[Batu Pahat High School]] and [[Malacca High School]]. He graduated from [[Monash University]] in Australia with a [[Bachelor of Economics]] (BEc). He also served as the president of MUISS (Monash University International Student Society) during his university years.\n\n==Political career==\nPrior to his political career, Lim was a senior executive at a bank.<ref name=\"dapmalaysia1\"/> He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Kota Melaka in 1986, defeating [[Soh Chin Aun]] with a majority of 17,606 votes. He was re-elected in the 1990 and 1995 general elections, albeit with reduced majorities. He thus became the first person to be elected to three consecutive terms in Kota Melaka. He was also the first [[Malacca High School]] alumnus to achieve this.\n\nIn October 1987, he was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] in [[Operation Lalang]], along with 106 other politicians and activists. He was released in April 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2012/10/28/guan-eng-calls-for-apology-on-ops-lalang-anniversary/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125202159/http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2012/10/28/guan-eng-calls-for-apology-on-ops-lalang-anniversary/ |archivedate=25 January 2013 }}</ref> He was the first person to be detained and the last to be released during Operation Lalang.\n\nHe was appointed the DAP Socialist Youth chairman in 1989 and was formally elected to that post in 1992. In 1995, he was elected the DAP Deputy Secretary-General. He was elected the party's Secretary-General in 2004, and has held that position since.\n\n===Jailed under Sedition Act===\nLim was arrested by the Malaysian police in 1994, following his criticism of the government's failure to bring the then-Chief Minister of [[Melaka]], Tan Sri Abdul [[Rahim Thamby Chik]]'s statutory rape case to trial when the [[Attorney General]] had decided not to press charges. Lim was charged under Section 4(1) (b) of the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act 1948]] for causing 'disaffection with the administration of justice in Malaysia'. He was also charged under Section 8A (1) of the [[Printing Presses and Publications Act|Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984]] for 'maliciously printing' a pamphlet containing allegedly 'false information' which supposedly described the alleged rape victim as an 'imprisoned victim' because she was initially detained by Malaysian police without parental consent for 10 days. During the judicial procedure, Lim was quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|If I fail and have to go to jail, I have no regrets. I have no regrets of going down fighting for the principles of truth and justice and pursuit of human rights, especially women's rights. There can be no women's rights if female rape victims are considered equally responsible, and even detained, whilst the accused remain free. |Lim Guan Eng<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/heureka/sunrise/lim-guan.htm |title=The Trial of Lim Guan Eng |website=Home.clara.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-02}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter a series of appeals, Lim was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He was, however, released after 12 months on 25 August 1999. Due to his incarceration, he was barred from standing for election to public office for a period of 5 years, and he was therefore ineligible to contest in the [[2004 Malaysian general election|2004 Malaysian General Election]].\n\n===Internal bickering===\nIn 2005, Lim suffered a surprise defeat in his campaign for re-election to the Malacca DAP committee. However, as Lim remained Secretary-General of the party, he was automatically included in the committee in accordance with the party's constitution. His wife, who had also failed to be elected to the Melaka committee, was not included in the committee even though she remained the chief of the state' s DAP women's wing.{{ref label|voted_out|1|a}} [[Teresa Kok]], a DAP MP, suggested that there was a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] behind the Lims' failure to be reelected.{{ref|conspiracy}} Nevertheless, Lim went on to garner the second highest number of votes (620)<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/23/nation/20080823192404&sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829121424/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F23%2Fnation%2F20080823192404&sec=nation|date=29 August 2008}}</ref> at the party's 15th National Congress on 23 August 2008.\n\n{{Disputed section|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Chief Minister of Penang ===\nIn the [[2008 Malaysian general election]], the DAP-[[Parti Keadilan Rakyat|PKR]]-[[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]] coalition, later known as [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR), won 29 out of the 40 state assembly seats contested in [[Penang]], defeating the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.

For his secondary education, he attended [[Batu Pahat High School]] and [[Malacca High School]]. He graduated from [[Monash University]] in Australia with a [[Bachelor of Economics]] (BEc). He also served as the president of MUISS (Monash University International Student Society) during his university years.\n\n==Political career==\nPrior to his political career, Lim was a senior executive at a bank.<ref name=\"dapmalaysia1\"/> He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Kota Melaka in 1986, defeating [[Soh Chin Aun]] with a majority of 17,606 votes. He was re-elected in the 1990 and 1995 general elections, albeit with reduced majorities. He thus became the first person to be elected to three consecutive terms in Kota Melaka. He was also the first [[Malacca High School]] alumnus to achieve this.\n\nIn October 1987, he was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] in [[Operation Lalang]], along with 106 other politicians and activists.

A car accident occurs, where Tiger gets into a coma, Shenbagam presumably dies, and Anu is lost. This accident was planned by Tiger's brother Sethu and Sethu's friend Maruthanaayagam. Anu is adopted with the name Roja by Shanthamoorty, who raises her in his orphanage. Many years later, Roja is grown up, but then a crimininal named Bhaiya Ganesh enters the orphanage secretly in order to molest the girls. Eventually a girl in the ashramam named Priya and Maruthanaayagam's daughter Saakshi kill Bhaiya Ganesh, and put the blame on Shanthamoorthy, who is then arrested. Roja is also unaware of her heritage as the daughter of Tiger Manickam and Shenbagam. Priya meanwhile, found Roja's childhoom items which Roja had when she was with Tiger and Shenbagam, and Priya goes to Tiger Manickam and lies to him that she is his daughter. Priya is then named Anu. Anu is also well-affiliated with Shenbagam's family. Roja, in order to bring Shanthamoorthy back, gets married to renowned Lawyer Arjun Prathap on a contractual basis for one year who agrees to help Roja. Arjun is actually the nephew of Shenbagam and belongs to Shenbagam's family. Arjun receives Roja's consent to dissolve the marriage after exactly one year by getting signatures in a mutual consent agreement. Roja accepts this agreement so that Arjun could become involved in a case related to her foster father. Arjun dislikes love and marriage due to his traumatic past involving his friend Venu's demise, but indulges in the contractual marriage in an attempt to prevent the marriage between him and Anu.\n\nThe entire family except Arjun's mother Kalpana hates Roja because she took Anu's spot. Annapoorani, who is Arjun and Anu's grandmother and Shenbagam's mother hates Roja the most. Anu teams up with Annapoorani's evil daughter and son-in-law Yashoda and Balu and try to get Roja out of the house several times. Yashoda hates Roja because Roja once humiliated her. Roja tries several times to find out her heritage, and Shantamoorthy's case, but she is stopped by Anu. Eventually Roja and Arjun fall in love with each other and the contractual marriage is forgotten. A police office called Chandrakantha who has a mysterious past also decides to help Arjun with the Bhaiya Ganesh murder case. When she is close to figuring the mystery, she is stopped by the Comissioner Gowtham Nath, who is affiliated with Saakshi for some reason. \n\nAnnapoorani's sister Kamakshi visits Canada once, and she along with Arjun, Roja, and Kalpana try to find out Roja's past and if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. Annapoorani is very sad that everyone is against Anu, and visits 108 temples and leaves the family. Kamakshi leaves India. Anu and Yashoda plan to kill Roja, but Roja only loses her eyesight. Arjun and Kalpana visit Arulvakku Amuthanayagi and seek help to restore Roja's eyesight. Arjun, on the advice of Amuthanayagi, does severe penance and brings Roja's eyesight back. After Roja's eyesight comes back, Annapoorani and Kamakshi return. Annapoorani has developed much more hatred for Arjun and Roja when she returns. Annapoorani decides to make Anu marry Arjun's brother Ashwin, but Ashwin likes a girl named Pooja. Ashwin and Pooja try to marry each other (with the help of Arjun, Roja, and Kamakshi) but are stopped by Annapoorani. Annapoorani makes arrangements for Ashwin- Anu marriage and Ashwin agrees reluctantly after Pooja gets kidnapped. However, Arjun saves Pooja in the last minute and stops the marriage. The story unfolds to show how Roja realises her dream of opening the orphanage with the help of Arjun amongst love, betrayal, hate and her past, how Arjun and Roja help Ashwin unite with Pooja, and how they try to find out if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. More twists arrive when it is revealed that Shenbagam is actually alive, but she has forgotten her past and lives as a nurse named Saraswati.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Priyanka Nalkari]] as Roja: Arjun's wife; She is the real Anu.\n* Sibbu Suryan as Arjun Prathap: He is a famous criminal lawyer; Roja's husband.\n*Shamili Sukumar as Priya (Main Antagonist): She fakes in the identity of Anu.\n\n===Supporting===\n*[[Dr. Sharmila]] as Shenbagam Manickam / Saraswathi: Roja's biological mother; Arjun's paternal aunt\n* Gayathri Shastry as Kalpana Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's mother\n* Sowmya Sharada \u2192 Sunitha as Saakshi Marudhanayagam (Antagonist): Priya's best friend.\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Annapoorani Vijayakumar: Pratap, Shenbagam and Yashodha's mother\n* Venkat Renganathan as Ashwin Prathap: Arjun's younger brother\n* Smriti Kashyap as Pooja: Ashwin's wife\n* Sumathi Shree as Sumathi\n* Shiva as Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's father\n* [[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-tv-serials/68563/Chinna-thirai-Television-News/Actor-Rajesh-again-in-Television.htm |title=\u0bae\u0bc0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |publisher=cinema.dinamalar.com |access-date=2018-04-26 |language=ta}} </ref> as Tiger Manickam: Roja's biological father; He is a famous criminal lawyer\n* [[K.

A car accident occurs, where Tiger gets into a coma, Shenbagam presumably dies, and Anu is lost. This accident was planned by Tiger's brother Sethu and Sethu's friend Maruthanaayagam. Anu is adopted with the name Roja by Shanthamoorty, who raises her in his orphanage. Many years later, Roja is grown up, but then a crimininal named Bhaiya Ganesh enters the orphanage secretly in order to molest the girls. Eventually a girl in the ashramam named Priya and Maruthanaayagam's daughter Saakshi kill Bhaiya Ganesh, and put the blame on Shanthamoorthy, who is then arrested. Roja is also unaware of her heritage as the daughter of Tiger Manickam and Shenbagam. Priya meanwhile, found Roja's childhoom items which Roja had when she was with Tiger and Shenbagam, and Priya goes to Tiger Manickam and lies to him that she is his daughter. Priya is then named Anu. Anu is also well-affiliated with Shenbagam's family. Roja, in order to bring Shanthamoorthy back, gets married to renowned Lawyer Arjun Prathap on a contractual basis for one year who agrees to help Roja. Arjun is actually the nephew of Shenbagam and belongs to Shenbagam's family. Arjun receives Roja's consent to dissolve the marriage after exactly one year by getting signatures in a mutual consent agreement. Roja accepts this agreement so that Arjun could become involved in a case related to her foster father. Arjun dislikes love and marriage due to his traumatic past involving his friend Venu's demise, but indulges in the contractual marriage in an attempt to prevent the marriage between him and Anu.\n\nThe entire family except Arjun's mother Kalpana hates Roja because she took Anu's spot. Annapoorani, who is Arjun and Anu's grandmother and Shenbagam's mother hates Roja the most. Anu teams up with Annapoorani's evil daughter and son-in-law Yashoda and Balu and try to get Roja out of the house several times. Yashoda hates Roja because Roja once humiliated her. Roja tries several times to find out her heritage, and Shantamoorthy's case, but she is stopped by Anu. Eventually Roja and Arjun fall in love with each other and the contractual marriage is forgotten. A police office called Chandrakantha who has a mysterious past also decides to help Arjun with the Bhaiya Ganesh murder case. When she is close to figuring the mystery, she is stopped by the Comissioner Gowtham Nath, who is affiliated with Saakshi for some reason. \n\nAnnapoorani's sister Kamakshi visits Canada once, and she along with Arjun, Roja, and Kalpana try to find out Roja's past and if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. Annapoorani is very sad that everyone is against Anu, and visits 108 temples and leaves the family. Kamakshi leaves India. Anu and Yashoda plan to kill Roja, but Roja only loses her eyesight. Arjun and Kalpana visit Arulvakku Amuthanayagi and seek help to restore Roja's eyesight. Arjun, on the advice of Amuthanayagi, does severe penance and brings Roja's eyesight back. After Roja's eyesight comes back, Annapoorani and Kamakshi return. Annapoorani has developed much more hatred for Arjun and Roja when she returns. Annapoorani decides to make Anu marry Arjun's brother Ashwin, but Ashwin likes a girl named Pooja. Ashwin and Pooja try to marry each other (with the help of Arjun, Roja, and Kamakshi) but are stopped by Annapoorani. Annapoorani makes arrangements for Ashwin- Anu marriage and Ashwin agrees reluctantly after Pooja gets kidnapped. However, Arjun saves Pooja in the last minute and stops the marriage. The story unfolds to show how Roja realises her dream of opening the orphanage with the help of Arjun amongst love, betrayal, hate and her past, how Arjun and Roja help Ashwin unite with Pooja, and how they try to find out if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. More twists arrive when it is revealed that Shenbagam is actually alive, but she has forgotten her past and lives as a nurse named Saraswati.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Priyanka Nalkari]] as Roja: Arjun's wife; She is the real Anu.\n* Sibbu Suryan as Arjun Prathap: He is a famous criminal lawyer; Roja's husband.\n*Shamili Sukumar as Priya (Main Antagonist): She fakes in the identity of Anu.\n\n===Supporting===\n*[[Dr. Sharmila]] as Shenbagam Manickam / Saraswathi: Roja's biological mother; Arjun's paternal aunt\n* Gayathri Shastry as Kalpana Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's mother\n* Sowmya Sharada \u2192 Sunitha as Saakshi Marudhanayagam (Antagonist): Priya's best friend.\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Annapoorani Vijayakumar: Pratap, Shenbagam and Yashodha's mother\n* Venkat Renganathan as Ashwin Prathap: Arjun's younger brother\n* Smriti Kashyap as Pooja: Ashwin's wife\n* Sumathi Shree as Sumathi\n* Shiva as Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's father\n* [[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-tv-serials/68563/Chinna-thirai-Television-News/Actor-Rajesh-again-in-Television.htm |title=\u0bae\u0bc0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |publisher=cinema.dinamalar.com |access-date=2018-04-26 |language=ta}} </ref> as Tiger Manickam: Roja's biological father; He is a famous criminal lawyer\n* [[K.

Basically it is [[code page 437]] with some positions filled with Polish letters. An important feature was that the block graphic characters of code page 437 remained unchanged. In contrast, [[IBM]]'s later official Central European [[code page 852]] did not preserve all block graphics, causing incorrect display in programs such as [[Norton Commander]].\n\nThe Mazovia encoding was designed in 1984 by Jan Klimowicz of {{Interlanguage link multi|Instytut Maszyn Matematycznych{{!}}IMM|pl|3=Instytut Maszyn Matematycznych}}. It was designed as part of a project to develop and produce a Polish IBM PC clone codenamed \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Mazovia 1016|pl}}\". The code page was therefore optimized for that computer's typical peripheral devices, a graphics card with dual switchable graphics, a keyboard using US English and Russian layouts and printers with Polish fonts. In 1986, the [[Polish National Bank]] (NBP) adopted the Mazovia encoding as a standard, thereby causing its widespread acceptance and distribution in Poland. They also were instrumental in Ipaco producing compatible computers with Taiwanese components under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Zbigniew Jakubas|pl}} and Krzysztof Sochacki.\n\nSome ambiguity exists in the official code page assignment for the Mazovia encoding:\n\n[[PTS-DOS]] and [[S/DOS]] support this encoding under code page 667 (CP667).<ref name=\"Paul_2001_NECPINW\"/> The same encoding was also called code page 991 (CP991) in some Polish software,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_PLC\"/><!-- The actual origin of the CP991 assignment is still unknown, but PLC shows that it must have existed before 1997. The PLC variant of CP991 seems to be identical to what PTS-DOS under codepage 667 and NEC supported in their Pinwriters as \"Mazovia\". PTS-DOS codepage 667 and the NEC font are known to be identical to the later code page 790, as supported by FreeDOS. The FreeDOS variant of CP991, however, seems to be incompatible with the original definition of CP991, but this needs to be verified. --> however, the FreeDOS implementation of code page 991 seems not to be identical to this original encoding.\nThe DOS code page switching file <code>NECPINW.CPI</code> for [[NEC Pinwriter]]s supports the Mazovia encoding under both code pages 667 and 991.<!-- the 790 assignment did not exist as this time --><ref name=\"Paul_2001_NECPINW\"/> FreeDOS has meanwhile introduced support for the original Mazovia encoding under code page 790 (CP790) as well. The [[Fujitsu]] ''DL6400 (Pro)'' / ''DL6600 (Pro)'' printers support the Mazovia encoding as well.<ref name=\"Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600\"/>\n\n==Character set==\nEach character is shown with its equivalent [[Unicode]] code point.<ref name=\"NEC_1993_EPROMs\"/><!-- NB. This source predates Unicode and just shows a table of glyphs used. I have carefully compared them with the table provided here (as of 2013-04-22) and found them to be matching. However, I can only confirm the glyphs, not the accuracy of the translation into Unicode, as some of the glyphs are not without ambiguity (for example, the font table in this source looks more like a Greek beta than a German sharp \u00df). Therefore, whatever ambiguity exists for a translation of CP437 to Unicode, it also exists for Mazovia to Unicode. --> Only the second half of the table (128&ndash;255) is shown, all of the first half (0&ndash;127) being the same as [[ASCII]] and [[code page 437]].\n\nSeveral variants of this encoding exists:\n\n* ''Mazovia 157'' ('''\u015b''' is at 9D instead of 9E)\n* ''Fido Mazovia'' ('''\u0107''' is at 0x87 instead of 8D and '''\u0106''' is at 0x80 instead of 0x95)\n* ''FreeDOS Mazovia'' ([[Polish z\u0142oty|z\u0142oty]] sign at 9B). FreeDOS supports this variant under code page 991, although the original definition of code page 991, which pre-dates FreeDOS, appears to have been identical to code page 667 / 790.\n\nThese variants are not fully compliant with the definition of code page 667 / 790 and should therefore not be associated with these numbers.\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|Code page 667 /

Basically it is [[code page 437]] with some positions filled with Polish letters. An important feature was that the block graphic characters of code page 437 remained unchanged. In contrast, [[IBM]]'s later official Central European [[code page 852]] did not preserve all block graphics, causing incorrect display in programs such as [[Norton Commander]].\n\nThe Mazovia encoding was designed in 1984 by Jan Klimowicz of {{Interlanguage link multi|Instytut Maszyn Matematycznych{{!}}IMM|pl|3=Instytut Maszyn Matematycznych}}. It was designed as part of a project to develop and produce a Polish IBM PC clone codenamed \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Mazovia 1016|pl}}\". The code page was therefore optimized for that computer's typical peripheral devices, a graphics card with dual switchable graphics, a keyboard using US English and Russian layouts and printers with Polish fonts. In 1986, the [[Polish National Bank]] (NBP) adopted the Mazovia encoding as a standard, thereby causing its widespread acceptance and distribution in Poland. They also were instrumental in Ipaco producing compatible computers with Taiwanese components under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Zbigniew Jakubas|pl}} and Krzysztof Sochacki.\n\nSome ambiguity exists in the official code page assignment for the Mazovia encoding:\n\n[[PTS-DOS]] and [[S/DOS]] support this encoding under code page 667 (CP667).<ref name=\"Paul_2001_NECPINW\"/> The same encoding was also called code page 991 (CP991) in some Polish software,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_PLC\"/><!-- The actual origin of the CP991 assignment is still unknown, but PLC shows that it must have existed before 1997. The PLC variant of CP991 seems to be identical to what PTS-DOS under codepage 667 and NEC supported in their Pinwriters as \"Mazovia\". PTS-DOS codepage 667 and the NEC font are known to be identical to the later code page 790, as supported by FreeDOS. The FreeDOS variant of CP991, however, seems to be incompatible with the original definition of CP991, but this needs to be verified. --> however, the FreeDOS implementation of code page 991 seems not to be identical to this original encoding.\nThe DOS code page switching file <code>NECPINW.CPI</code> for [[NEC Pinwriter]]s supports the Mazovia encoding under both code pages 667 and 991.<!-- the 790 assignment did not exist as this time --><ref name=\"Paul_2001_NECPINW\"/> FreeDOS has meanwhile introduced support for the original Mazovia encoding under code page 790 (CP790) as well. The [[Fujitsu]] ''DL6400 (Pro)'' / ''DL6600 (Pro)'' printers support the Mazovia encoding as well.<ref name=\"Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600\"/>\n\n==Character set==\nEach character is shown with its equivalent [[Unicode]] code point.<ref name=\"NEC_1993_EPROMs\"/><!-- NB. This source predates Unicode and just shows a table of glyphs used. I have carefully compared them with the table provided here (as of 2013-04-22) and found them to be matching. However, I can only confirm the glyphs, not the accuracy of the translation into Unicode, as some of the glyphs are not without ambiguity (for example, the font table in this source looks more like a Greek beta than a German sharp \u00df). Therefore, whatever amibuity exists for a translation of CP437 to Unicode, it also exists for Mazovia to Unicode. --> Only the second half of the table (128&ndash;255) is shown, all of the first half (0&ndash;127) being the same as [[ASCII]] and [[code page 437]]. Differences from code page 437 are shown boxed.\n\nSeveral variants of this encoding exists:\n\n* ''Mazovia 157'' ('''\u015b''' is at 9D instead of 9E)\n* ''Fido Mazovia'' ('''\u0107''' is at 0x87 instead of 8D and '''\u0106''' is at 0x80 instead of 0x95)\n* ''FreeDOS Mazovia'' ([[Polish z\u0142oty|z\u0142oty]] sign at 9B). FreeDOS supports this variant under code page 991, although the original definition of code page 991, which pre-dates FreeDOS, appears to have been identical to code page 667 / 790.\n\nThese variants are not fully compliant with the definition of code page 667 / 790 and should therefore not be associated with these numbers.\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|Code page 667 /

The customer service are not helpful at all just follow their scripts and lines and are not creative to work out with clients. The company is not emphatic with world wide situations and clearly only interest is the money does not show passion for what they do. \n\nPutting this review on the side, I got hung up several times, wait hours for response from a manager, and the answer they provided were limited not with no difference from what agent from customer service say to me. I lost 262 thanks God was not much, but enough to show me what kind of mess I got myself into. I wish I could do legal process but unfortunately with court might end up losing more in the process than getting this situated and fix. Their refund process was unbelievable, if you wanted a full refund you have to get assistance and for that process they tell you to pay the fee for $21 while you\u2019re on the phone and doing the process with them at the same time otherwise just keep what they offer to you that is 90% of the refund in a time frame of 6 months (you know when you totally forget about it, so that way they don\u2019t have to do it), besides this refunds options you can get instant refund in \u201ckiwi credit\u201d where terms are not clear and they make you agree to not adjust this terms or do other claims.
