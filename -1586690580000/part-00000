According to lexicographer [[Ben Zimmer]]<ref name=zimmer2 />, ''whataboutery'' was used with a similar meaning in the 1970s. He cites a 1974 letter by Sean O'Conaill which was published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and which referred to \"the Whatabouts ... who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I.R.A. with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the 'enemy{{'\"}} and an opinion column entitled 'Enter the cultural British Army' by 'Backbencher' (Irish Journalists John Healy) in the same paper which picked up the theme using the term \"whataboutery\". It is likely that ''whataboutery'' derived from Healy's response to O'Conaill's letter. \n\n\"I would not suggest such a thing were it not for the Whatabouts.

He cites a 1974 letter by Sean O'Conaill which was published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and which referred to \"the Whatabouts ... who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I.R.A. with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the 'enemy{{'\"}} and an opinion column entitled 'Enter the cultural British Army' by 'Backbencher' (Irish Journalists John Healy) in the same paper which picked up the theme using the term \"whataboutery\". It is likely that ''whataboutery'' derived from Healy's response to O'Conaill's letter. \n\n\"I would not suggest such a thing were it not for the Whatabouts.

For instance, in international relations, behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be quite good for a given geopolitical neighborhood, and deserves to be recognized as such.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nChristian Christensen, Professor of Journalism in Stockholm, argues that the accusation of whataboutism is itself a form of the ''tu quoque'' fallacy, as it dismisses criticisms of one's own behavior to focus instead on the actions of another, thus creating a [[double standard]]. Those who use whataboutism are not necessarily engaging in an empty or cynical deflection of responsibility: whataboutism can be a useful tool to expose contradictions, double standards, and hypocrisy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/1/whataboutism-charlie-hebdo-king-abdullah.html|title=We need 'whataboutism' now more than ever|last=Christensen|first=Christian|date=26 January 2015|website=Al-Jazeera English|access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/opinion/one-cheer-for-whataboutism.html|title=One Cheer for Whataboutism|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|date=19 July 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=17 August 2018|quote=Tu quoque is a subset of the so-called ad hominem argument: a strike against the character, not the position, of one\u2019s opponent.

Korean online communities claimed that 2chan members were accusing Yuna Kim of bribery and finding delight in the murder of the Korean student in Russia. An internet community, Terror Response Association was formed with the objective of carrying out a cyber attack on 2chan on March 1, 2010. Although the TAA prohibited the distribution or the use of illegal software, members continuously distributed illegal software leading up to the day of the attack.\n\nOn February 25, around midnight, Japanese posts appeared on DC Inside's comedy gallery and its users claimed that the servers had slowed down, and interpreted these as signs of a preemptive attack from 2chan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/3997/20100225002408.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120712160823/http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/3997/20100225002408.jpg|url-status=dead|title=20100225002408.jpg (730x600 pixels)|archivedate=12 July 2012|access-date=19 March 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Korean appeared on 2chan's Korean threads as well, however Japanese did not appear on 2chan's Korean galleries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9391/20100225005031.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711005319/http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9391/20100225005031.jpg|url-status=dead|title=20100225005031.jpg (642x500 pixels)|archivedate=11 July 2012|access-date=19 March 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In a few minutes, the DC Inside servers returned to its usual speeds.\n\nOn February 26, attacks were carried out on 2chan's Yaoi forum. During the Figure Skating Short Program of the Vancouver Olympics that took place a few days before the attack, Kim Yu Na took the lead over Asada Mao by meager 5 points and won the gold medal. 2channers suggested that Kim Yu Na won the gold medal through bribery. However, whether this attack really originated from Korean users is unclear because the vandalism that appeared on 2chan's website did not contain any Korean but only English phrases such as \u201cI\u2019m Korean.\u201d The identity of the attackers is unclear, and it is possible that this attack was actually carried out by 2chan users.\n\nOn February 28, a committee of 2channers scheduled two rounds of attacks on DC Inside at 8 PM and 9 PM within 30 minute windows. These attacks proved to be ineffective. The upcoming cyber war began attracting attention from the press.\n\n1 PM on March 1, the TAA began the attack in two teams \u2013 one team vandalized the website, the other team carried out a DDoS attack.<ref name=\"inewp2\"/> 1:03 PM, only three minutes after the initiation of the attack, 2chan's VIP gallery was paralyzed. 1:13 PM, five servers were paralyzed. 1:16 PM, the main channel's login requests started to get effected. 1:22 PM, all but two of the thirty-three 2chan servers were all paralyzed. 1:44 PM, the entire server was down.<ref name=\"inewp2\" /> 2:13 PM, 2chan's main page was hacked and replaced with a page containing the Korean flag.<ref name=\"inewp2\" /> 2:43 PM, naver.com blocked Japanese IPs. 3:35 PM, 2chan blocked Korean IPs, however the servers were not yet restored. A Korean student in Japan spied on the Japanese plans for retribution. At 6 PM, it was discovered that a website had plans for attacking the Blue House website. However, some Koreans who disliked Lee Myung Bak (Korean President at the time of the attack) participated in this attack. The Blue House shortly blocked Japanese IPs. 6:11 PM, VANK homepage started receiving attacks and was paralyzed for about 1 hour but was soon restored. It has been rumored that some of VANK's routers exploded from the attack. 6:38 PM, attacks on Comedy Program Gallery began, but the attacks were deflected in four minutes. 8:43 PM, organizers from 2chan declared the end of the attacks. 9:35 PM, 2chan had been effectively downed for 8 hours, and MBC reported on the outcome.<ref name=\"inewp2\" />\n\nAround 6 PM of the following day, the servers began to restore (At 8 PM, most of the servers were running normally). At 7 PM, another attack on VANK was made without success, and prompted a retribution attack from TAA, downing the control server of 2chan. Around 8 PM, attacks were again initiated by 2ch, but failed. 10 PM, VANK blocked all Japanese IPs.\n\nOn March 5, 2ch provisionally suspended attacks and promised to strike on August 15. On August 15, the attacks were announced but the day passed by without offense from either side. A Korean gaming portal was downed this day but it was confirmed this was not an attack from Japan. A lot of fingers were pointed, including at China, at business establishments, and some speculated that it was an inside job by DC Inside. The Japanese Wiki article on this topic claims that VANK had a main role in this attack.\n\n== Outcome ==\nConnecting to 2chan were impossible from the morning of March 1 until the evening of March 2nd when the attacks shrunk and a portion of the servers were partially recovered.<ref>{{cite news|title=(cache) Graph: 2chtotal|language=ja|url=http://megalodon.jp/2010-0303-1141-03/traffic.maido3.com/VLpv/rTU0/h1Od/|date=2010-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=(cache) \uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u8ca0\u8377\u76e3\u8996\u6240|url=http://megalodon.jp/2010-0302-1956-18/ch2.ath.cx/|date=2010-03-02}}</ref> The next day, about a third of the servers were restored, and by the evening all but the Dubai server were completely restored.

However, the investigation was not actually carried out. This cyberwarfare collaterally impacted some US agencies. Management of Big-server.com stated that a German who enforced cyberattacks was arrested in the US and sentenced to two years. However, it was later confirmed that this scenario was fantasized by 2chan users, and a US journalist had picked up on this and published an article without checking the details. Because the FBI investigates activity that occurs within the United States, it is unlikely that they have actually investigated this cyberwar. CIA, on the other hand, may investigate this cyberwar in collaboration with South Korean or Japanese intelligence agencies, police forces, and etc., with the approval of ministries on both ends (Japan has no official collective intelligence agency, instead there are intelligence clusters such as the Chief Cabinet Secretary's intelligence investigators, the Ministry of Justice's Public Inspection Agency, National Police Agency Security Bureau, and the Defense Agency).<ref>[http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/it/100302/its1003022017002-n1.htm 2\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b\u653b\u6483\u3067\u7c73\u4f01\u696d\u304cFBI\u3068\u6cd5\u7684\u63aa\u7f6e\u691c\u8a0e\u3000\u640d\u5bb32\u51042\u5343\u4e07\u5186] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108062826/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/it/100302/its1003022017002-n1.htm |date=2011-01-08 }} \u7523\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e 2010.3.2\u95b2\u89a7</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.j-cast.com/2010/03/03061510.html?p=all|title=2\u3061\u3083\u3093\u653b\u6483\u306f\u56fd\u969b\u72af\u7f6a\u3000FBI\u304c\u9996\u8b00\u8005\u5272\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u635c\u67fb\u3078 : J-CAST\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9|publisher=J-CAST\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9|date=2010-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/men+indicted+over+cyber+attacks/2487967 |title=Men indicted over cyber attacks |website=Channel 4}}</ref>\n* The head of Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) stated, \u201cJapan has hurt their own reputation in the eyes of the international society\u201d, \u201cInflicting F5 attacks is no different than what Japan did.

However, whether this attack really originated from Korean users is unclear because the vandalism that appeared on 2chan's website did not contain any Korean but only English phrases such as \u201cI\u2019m Korean.\u201d The identity of the attackers is unclear, and it is possible that this attack was actually carried out by 2chan users.\n\nOn February 28, a committee of 2channers scheduled two rounds of attacks on DC Inside at 8 PM and 9 PM within 30 minute windows. These attacks proved to be ineffective. The upcoming cyber war began attracting attention from the press.\n\n1 PM on March 1, the TAA began the attack in two teams \u2013 one team vandalized the website, the other team carried out a DDoS attack.<ref name=\"inewp2\"/> 1:03 PM, only three minutes after the initiation of the attack, 2chan's VIP gallery was paralyzed. 1:13 PM, five servers were paralyzed. 1:16 PM, the main channel's login requests started to get effected. 1:22 PM, all but two of the thirty-three 2chan servers were all paralyzed. 1:44 PM, the entire server was down.<ref name=\"inewp2\" /> 2:13 PM, 2chan's main page was hacked and replaced with a page containing the Korean flag.<ref name=\"inewp2\" /> 2:43 PM, naver.com blocked Japanese IPs. 3:35 PM, 2chan blocked Korean IPs, however the servers were not yet restored. A Korean student in Japan spied on the Japanese plans for retribution. At 6 PM, it was discovered that a website had plans for attacking the Blue House website. However, some Koreans who disliked Lee Myung Bak (Korean President at the time of the attack) participated in this attack. The Blue House shortly blocked Japanese IPs. 6:11 PM, VANK homepage started receiving attacks and was paralyzed for about 1 hour but was soon restored. It has been rumored that some of VANK's routers exploded from the attack. 6:38 PM, attacks on Comedy Program Gallery began, but the attacks were deflected in four minutes. 8:43 PM, organizers from 2chan declared the end of the attacks. 9:35 PM, 2chan had been effectively downed for 8 hours, and MBC reported on the outcome.<ref name=\"inewp2\" />\n\nAround 6 PM of the following day, the servers began to restore (At 8 PM, most of the servers were running normally). At 7 PM, another attack on VANK was made without success, and prompted a retribution attack from TAA, downing the control server of 2chan. Around 8 PM, attacks were again initiated by 2ch, but failed. 10 PM, VANK blocked all Japanese IPs.\n\nOn March 5, 2ch provisionally suspended attacks and promised to strike on August 15. On August 15, the attacks were announced but the day passed by without offense from either side. A Korean gaming portal was downed this day but it was confirmed this was not an attack from Japan. A lot of fingers were pointed, including at China, at business establishments, and some speculated that it was an inside job by DC Inside. The Japanese Wiki article on this topic claims that VANK had a main role in this attack.\n\n== Outcome ==\nConnecting to 2chan were impossible from the morning of March 1 until the evening of March 2nd when the attacks shrunk and a portion of the servers were partially recovered.<ref>{{cite news|title=(cache) Graph: 2chtotal|language=ja|url=http://megalodon.jp/2010-0303-1141-03/traffic.maido3.com/VLpv/rTU0/h1Od/|date=2010-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=(cache) \uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u8ca0\u8377\u76e3\u8996\u6240|url=http://megalodon.jp/2010-0302-1956-18/ch2.ath.cx/|date=2010-03-02}}</ref> The next day, about a third of the servers were restored, and by the evening all but the Dubai server were completely restored.

There were reports that routers at VANK exploded, however, VANK had merely blocked Japanese IPs.\n\n== Reactions and Responses ==\n\n* Pacific Internet Exchange, the managing company of 2chan's servers, declared on March 2 that they were preparing to investigate this event as a cyber-terrorism attack in collaboration with USA's Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/1003/02/news070.html|title=2ch\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c6\u30ed\u300d\u3068\u3057\u3066\u7c73\u6a5f\u95a2\u306b\u8abf\u67fb\u4f9d\u983c\u3078|website=ITmedia NEWS}}</ref> by collecting and analyzing data related to this attack. However, the investigation was not actually carried out. This cyberwarfare collaterally impacted some US agencies. Management of Big-server.com stated that a German who enforced cyberattacks was arrested in the US and sentenced to two years. However, it was later confirmed that this scenario was fantasized by 2chan users, and a US journalist had picked up on this and published an article without checking the details. Because the FBI investigates activity that occurs within the United States, it is unlikely that they have actually investigated this cyberwar. CIA, on the other hand, may investigate this cyberwar in collaboration with South Korean or Japanese intelligence agencies, police forces, and etc., with the approval of ministries on both ends (Japan has no official collective intelligence agency, instead there are intelligence clusters such as the Chief Cabinet Secretary's intelligence investigators, the Ministry of Justice's Public Inspection Agency, National Police Agency Security Bureau, and the Defense Agency).<ref>[http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/it/100302/its1003022017002-n1.htm 2\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b\u653b\u6483\u3067\u7c73\u4f01\u696d\u304cFBI\u3068\u6cd5\u7684\u63aa\u7f6e\u691c\u8a0e\u3000\u640d\u5bb32\u51042\u5343\u4e07\u5186] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108062826/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/it/100302/its1003022017002-n1.htm |date=2011-01-08 }} \u7523\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e 2010.3.2\u95b2\u89a7</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.j-cast.com/2010/03/03061510.html?p=all|title=2\u3061\u3083\u3093\u653b\u6483\u306f\u56fd\u969b\u72af\u7f6a\u3000FBI\u304c\u9996\u8b00\u8005\u5272\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u635c\u67fb\u3078 : J-CAST\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9|publisher=J-CAST\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9|date=2010-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/men+indicted+over+cyber+attacks/2487967 |title=Men indicted over cyber attacks |website=Channel 4}}</ref>\n* The head of Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) stated, \u201cJapan has hurt their own reputation in the eyes of the international society\u201d, \u201cInflicting F5 attacks is no different than what Japan did.
