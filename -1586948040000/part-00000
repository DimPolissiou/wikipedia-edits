[[Saintonge]] is the region around [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] in the centre-west of France in which most of the war occurred.\n\nThe conflict arose because vassals of Louis in Poitou were displeased with the accession of his brother, [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers|Alphonse]], as Count of [[Poitou]]. The French decisively defeated the English and rebel forces at the [[Battle of Taillebourg]] and concluded the struggle at the Siege of Saintes. Louis further repressed the Toulousians into surrendering. He restored Guyenne to Henry as a noble gesture and to seek for further peace so that he could go on a crusade. The battle was the last major conflict between the English and French until the [[Anglo-French War (1294\u20131303)|Anglo-French War of 1294\u20131303]]. The war announced the end of Henry's hopes of restoring the Angevin Empire lost under King [[John I of England]] and further planted the seeds for the [[Second Barons' War]] in England, due to the waste of funds and to the growing resentment among the barons towards the king, for his tyrannical ways (by ignoring the [[Magna Carta]]) and for his incompetence in war.\n\n==A feudal revolt==\nThe origin of this episode of the predecessor to the ''[[Hundred Years' War|Hundred Years War]]'', fought between France and England, was in the revolt of a Poitevin baron, Hugh X, lord of Lusignan. The source of this conflict originated from the confiscation by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of lands held by king [[John, King of England|John]] in France, specifically in Poitiers. Although [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard Earl of Cornwall]], John's second oldest son and brother to [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], was count of Poitiers after John's death, this was only nominal. King [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], of France, son of Philip Augustus, had instead transferred the title to his second oldest son, [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers|Alphonse de Poitiers]]. Alphonse was not allowed to take possession of his fiefdom until the age of 18 years, which he did in 1240. In June 1241, king Louis IX of France, son of Louis VIII, held a plenary court at [[Saumur]] in [[Anjou]] and announced that his brother, Alphonse, having come of age, was ready to come into possession of the title. On that occasion, Alphonse received the homage of the lords of the province, given even by the most powerful of them, [[Hugh X of Lusignan|Hugh X]] of Lusignan.\n\nHugh possessed several lands in Poitou, including his family stronghold in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Lusignan|Lusignan]], the castle of [[Montreuil-Bonnin]] and, above all, the [[County of La Marche|County of Marche]]. Lusignan had a long tradition of autonomy in the heart of Aquitaine, far from the successive capitals of the kingdoms of France and England. Therefore, the Lusignans were not receptive to Capetian authority in the region. [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame|Isabelle of Angoul\u00eame]], mother to Henry and Richard, and now spouse of Hugh, was particularly frustrated that her son had not officially received the title that he had nominally held.<ref name=\"Le Goff 178\u2013179\">{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=178\u2013179}}</ref> Along with a number of other Poitevin lords, Hugh could not accept the loss of autonomy to the increasingly growing demesne of the Capetian royal family, and thus the Poitevin nobility formed a confederacy against the House of Capet.<ref name=\"Le Goff 178\u2013179\"/> The starting point for the conflict was at Christmas time in 1241, when Hugh X of Lusignan, no doubt at the instigation of Isabelle, insulted the new Count of Poitiers in his own palace, by refusing allegiance. [[Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VII of Toulouse]], Count of Toulouse, sought redress for the Treaty of Paris of 1229 (which ended the [[Albigensian Crusade]]), under the terms of which he had lost most of his lands, and thus joined the revolting barons as well, but would not participate in the fighting for a while.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183}}</ref>\n\n==The Capetian reaction==\nImmediately, the Capetian family reacted. On 5 January 1242, Count Alphonse of Poitiers called together the Poitevin nobles at [[Chinon]] for Easter. The faithful lords, and others less loyal but nonetheless enemies of Lusignan, responded to the appeal.  Although his mother [[Blanche of Castile]] had coped with baronial uprisings before and carried on the royal affairs since 1226, with the title \"baillistre\" (protector of the heir in feudal law), Louis IX decided to go to the assistance of his brother and forcibly take control of the [[County of La Marche]]. In April 1242, Louis assembled a force at [[Chinon]] that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000.<ref group=Note>Modern estimates put Louis at the head of around 25,000 troops containing 1,000 wagons, 4,000 knights, and 20,000 squires, sergeants, and crossbowmen.</ref> On 9 May, he marched against the castle of Montreuil-Bonnin, the fortress of Lusignan. After having seizing a multitude of rebel castles, he steered towards [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]].<ref name=\":4\" /> On 20 May 1242, Henry and Richard departed from [[Portsmouth]] for [[Royan]] and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000.<ref group=Note>Modern estimates put Henry at the head of an army similar in size to Louis' army but varying in composition; 1,600 knights, 20,000 or more squires and sergeants, and 700 crossbowmen. Combined with rebel forces, the total number of men would have outnumbered the Franco-Poitevin troops.</ref> The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing.

While completing his conquest of lower [[Poitou]], he declared war on Saint Louis on 16 July. On 20 July, the French army arrived at [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]] where the inevitable clash took place.\n\n==Battle of Taillebourg==\n{{main|Battle of Taillebourg}}\n[[File:Louis9 vs Henri3.jpg|thumb|Battle between the French (Louis IX) and the English (Henry III). ([[British Library]], Royal 16 G VI f. 399)|alt=|left]]\nHenry advanced to [[Tonnay-Charente]] by mid-July and Louis moved to [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly]], just north of [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]], the armies intending to reach the bridge across the [[Charente River]], located in the commune of Taillebourg. Henry and Hugh positioned their army near the village of [[Port-d'Envaux|Saint-James]] on the west bank of the river and camped in the neighbouring field, while Louis was welcomed to the fortified chateau of [[Geoffrey de Rancon|Geoffroy de Rancon]], the Lord of Taillebourg. Henry decided to send an advance guard to protect the left bank of the Taillebourg bridge, a move that led to a sharp encounter with some French troops on either 21 or 22 July.

The settlement of the feudal revolt was devastating for Hugh. His Poitevin castles were confiscated, rearmed, and sold by Alphonse of Poitiers. He further humiliated himself by coming to Louis crying and kneeling before him with his wife and three sons and asked for forgiveness.<ref name=\":2\" /> His daughter Isabel of Lusignan was married to his enemy Geoffrey of Rancon in 1250, who rebuilt his castle with the dowry.\n\nIt is only during the retreat of the English and rebel forces that Raymond of Toulouse began his campaign against the king. He was able to capture the cities of [[Narbonne]] and [[Albi]] within August.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=184}}</ref> Unfortunately for Raymond, [[Roger IV, Count of Foix|Roger IV]], [[Count of Foix]] and vassal to Raymond, stubbornly resisted his war efforts by making his own war with Raymond and submitting only to the king. This gave Louis time to organize an army and split it into two to retake the captured cities. By 30 November, the war with the king came to an end. The war with Roger would persist until January 1243 and would end in yet another defeat for Raymond. Under subjugation, Raymond was forced to give up the two cities that he took and made a promise to fight the [[Catharism|Cathar]] heresy in return for a pardon from the king in [[Montargis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=185}}</ref>\n\n== Blockade of La Rochelle ==\nIn a final desperate attempt to prevent a complete takeover of his lands in Aquitaine and [[Gascony]], Henry organized a blockade on the port city of [[La Rochelle]] by sea to distract French forces from marching further south. The blockade was largely unsuccessful as the outcome of the war had already been mostly determined. Henry looked further for new allies. In January 1243, Henry sent a letter to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], to whom he had made a request for an alliance earlier, announcing the end of his hopes for retaking his possessions in France.

Initially, Henry refused to give up the rights the territory of his ancestors in France, however, Louis restored [[Guyenne]] to Henry, thinking that this noble gesture would assure him an extended time of peace with England because he was mostly concerned with going on the [[Seventh Crusade]] in 1248 and wanted to rally support for the cause within his own realm.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=302\u2013303}}</ref> By signing the treaty, Louis and Henry put an end to the century-old conflict between [[Capetians]] and [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] concerning the lands inherited by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] of England conquered by [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of France.

[[Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VII of Toulouse]], Count of Toulouse, sought redress for the Treaty of Paris of 1229 (which ended the [[Albigensian Crusade]]), under the terms of which he had lost most of his lands, and thus joined the revolting barons as well, but would not participate in the fighting for a while.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183}}</ref>\n\n==The Capetian reaction==\nImmediately, the Capetian family reacted. On 5 January 1242, Count Alphonse of Poitiers called together the Poitevin nobles at [[Chinon]] for Easter. The faithful lords, and others less loyal but nonetheless enemies of Lusignan, responded to the appeal.  Although his mother [[Blanche of Castile]] had coped with baronial uprisings before and carried on the royal affairs since 1226, with the title \"baillistre\" (protector of the heir in feudal law), Louis IX decided to go to the assistance of his brother and forcibly take control of the [[County of La Marche]]. In April 1242, Louis assembled a force at [[Chinon]] that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000.<ref group=Note>Modern estimates put Louis at the head of around 25,000 troops containing 1,000 wagons, 4,000 knights, and 20,000 squires, sergeants, and crossbowmen.</ref> On 9 May, he marched against the castle of Montreuil-Bonnin, the fortress of Lusignan. After having seizing a multitude of rebel castles, he steered towards [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]].<ref name=\":4\" /> On 20 May 1242, Henry and Richard departed from [[Portsmouth]] for [[Royan]] and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000.<ref group=Note>Modern estimates put Henry at the head of an army similar in size to Louis' army but varying in composition; 1,600 knights, 20,000 or more squires and sergeants, and 700 crossbowmen. Combined with rebel forces, the total number of men would have outnumbered the Franco-Poitevin troops.</ref> The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing. Henry had intentions to regain the past [[Angevin Empire]] of his predecessors on the basis that the title of Count of Poitou still belonged to his brother, Richard.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=180}}</ref> This was not the first war that Henry had waged in France either as he had earlier lead an expedition to France in 1230,<ref group=Note>The vast majority of wars and conflicts in the [[High Middle Ages]] involved besieging castles, capturing cities, small skirmishes, and raids, and did not always involve a large-scale battle.</ref> however, Henry was convinced that Hugh would provide the necessary support to reverse the lacklustre results of the last war. While completing his conquest of lower [[Poitou]], he declared war on Saint Louis on 16 July. On 20 July, the French army arrived at [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]] where the inevitable clash took place.\n\n==Battle of Taillebourg==\n{{main|Battle of Taillebourg}}\n[[File:Louis9 vs Henri3.jpg|thumb|Battle between the French (Louis IX) and the English (Henry III). ([[British Library]], Royal 16 G VI f. 399)|alt=|left]]\nHenry advanced to [[Tonnay-Charente]] by mid-July and Louis moved to [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly]], just north of [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]], the armies intending to reach the bridge across the [[Charente River]], located in the commune of Taillebourg. Henry and Hugh positioned their army near the village of [[Port-d'Envaux|Saint-James]] on the west bank of the river and camped in the neighbouring field, while Louis was welcomed to the fortified chateau of [[Geoffrey de Rancon|Geoffroy de Rancon]], the Lord of Taillebourg. Henry decided to send an advance guard to protect the left bank of the Taillebourg bridge, a move that led to a sharp encounter with some French troops on either 21 or 22 July. Louis decided to follow up this engagement and launched a full offensive with the entire French army.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=182}}</ref> The aggressive French assaults carried the day and the English king fled south to the town of Saintes, along with the revolting barons. A prolonged melee fight ensued north of Saintes, however the English were defeated in a definitive fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=181}}</ref> Louis lost comparatively fewer men than the English army but had to face with an epidemic of dysentery that ravaged his army. This forced Louis and his men to return to Paris by August.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Siege of Saintes==\nOn 22 or 23 July the French army laid siege to the city of [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]]. Henry realized that Hugh did not have as much support as he may have earlier claimed and withdrew to [[Bordeaux]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Shortly afterwards, the citizens handed over the keys to the city to Louis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=181\u2013182}}</ref>\n\n== The resolution of the revolt in France ==\nRecognizing that he was in a hopeless position after the siege of Saintes, Hugh surrendered to Louis on 24 July. The settlement of the feudal revolt was devastating for Hugh. His Poitevin castles were confiscated, rearmed, and sold by Alphonse of Poitiers. He further humiliated himself by coming to Louis crying and kneeling before him with his wife and three sons and asked for forgiveness.<ref name=\":2\" /> His daughter Isabel of Lusignan was married to his enemy Geoffrey of Rancon in 1250, who rebuilt his castle with the dowry.\n\nIt is only during the retreat of the English and rebel forces that Raymond of Toulouse began his campaign against the king. He was able to capture the cities of [[Narbonne]] and [[Albi]] within August.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=184}}</ref> Unfortunately for Raymond, [[Roger IV, Count of Foix|Roger IV]], [[Count of Foix]] and vassal to Raymond, stubbornly resisted his war efforts by making his own war with Raymond and submitting only to the king. This gave Louis time to organize an army and split it into two to retake the captured cities. By 30 November, the war with the king came to an end. The war with Roger would persist until January 1243 and would end in yet another defeat for Raymond. Under subjugation, Raymond was forced to give up the two cities that he took and made a promise to fight the [[Catharism|Cathar]] heresy in return for a pardon from the king in [[Montargis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=185}}</ref>\n\n== Blockade of La Rochelle ==\nIn a final desperate attempt to prevent a complete takeover of his lands in Aquitaine and [[Gascony]], Henry organized a blockade on the port city of [[La Rochelle]] by sea to distract French forces from marching further south. The blockade was largely unsuccessful as the outcome of the war had already been mostly determined. Henry looked further for new allies. In January 1243, Henry sent a letter to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], to whom he had made a request for an alliance earlier, announcing the end of his hopes for retaking his possessions in France. On 12 March, Henry was forced to ask Louis for a five-year truce.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=301}}</ref>\n\n== France and England make peace ==\n{{main|Treaty of Paris (1259)}}\n[[File:Trait\u00e9 Paris 1259.jpg|thumb|Treaty of Paris ratified in London on October 13, 1259 by Henry III, King of England, and Louis IX, sealed with the seal of Henry III in green wax on red and green silk cords.]]\nA truce was signed at [[Pons, Charente-Maritime|Pons]] on 1 August. A more lasting [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace was concluded at Paris]] on 4 December 1259 amidst the threat of a [[Second Barons' War|second Baron's war]] in England. Initially, Henry refused to give up the rights the territory of his ancestors in France, however, Louis restored [[Guyenne]] to Henry, thinking that this noble gesture would assure him an extended time of peace with England because he was mostly concerned with going on the [[Seventh Crusade]] in 1248 and wanted to rally support for the cause within his own realm.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=302\u2013303}}</ref> By signing the treaty, Louis and Henry put an end to the century-old conflict between [[Capetians]] and [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] concerning the lands inherited by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] of England conquered by [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] of France. By this text, Henry III renounced his claims concerning [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], [[Touraine]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and [[Poitou]]; in return Louis IX gave him the necessary sum to maintain 500 knights for two years, plus the revenues of the [[Agenais]], and his domains in the dioceses of [[Limoges]], [[Cahors]] and [[P\u00e9rigueux]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=302}}</ref> On February 10, 1259, the treaty was first ratified by Richard of Cornwall.

Finally, Henry arrived in France on December 4, 1259 to pay homage to Louis, thus symbolically ending the rivalry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saint Louis|last=Le Goff|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=303}}</ref> Afterwards, an unexpected and lively friendship arose between the two kings to the point that, sometime later, Louis offered Henry an elephant which had been given to him by the Sultan of Egypt: He also, as Henry's feudal overlord, ratified a [[papal bull]] that annulled the [[Provisions of Oxford]], and declared himself as a firm supporter of the [[Royal prerogative]] in England.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Historical background note==\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\nIn English history, the \u2018[[Hundred Years\u2019 War]]\u2019 refers to the 116-year period between 1337 \u2013 1453.

Spencer's biggest rival is her older sister, Melissa, and the two are constantly fighting over something. Their relationship is often strained by the fact that Spencer has a habit of crushing on Melissa's boyfriends. In the first season, she begins a relationship with fellow student and strained Rosewood student Toby Cavanaugh. Throughout the series, Spencer is revealed to be the biological daughter of Mary Drake and the sister of Charlotte Drake.\n\n===Aria Montgomery===\n{{main|Aria Montgomery}}\nConsidered the \"alternative\" one of the group, '''Aria Montgomery''', portrayed by [[Lucy Hale]], is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College. Alison encourages Aria to tell her mother the truth, but instead, Aria reluctantly agrees to keep her father's secret. On top of that, she finds herself involved with her high school English teacher, Ezra Fitz, after making out with him in a pub bathroom and discovering he was her English teacher on the first day of school.\n\n===Hanna Marin===\n{{main|Hanna Marin}}\nPretty and fierce, '''Hanna Marin''', portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]], is the diva and \"[[it girl]]\" of the group, having taken Alison's place as the most popular girl at Rosewood High. Prior to Alison's death, Hanna suffered from [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], which Alison frequently teased her over. Since her parents divorced, Hanna permanently lives with her mother. She feels betrayed by her father, who has remarried, and she does not get along well with his new wife and daughter. When Hanna's mother falls upon financial hardship, she steals thousands of dollars from the bank she worked at, which Hanna is forced to keep a secret.\n\n===Emily Fields===\n{{main|Emily Fields}}\nThe \"[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]\" of the group, '''Emily Fields''', portrayed by [[Shay Mitchell]], is a highly competitive swimmer, considered the star of Rosewood's swimming team. She is shown as a sweet and shy young. For a short time, Emily lives with Hanna, after her mother moves to Texas to live with Emily's father, who is stationed in Fort Hood. She begins to question her sexuality because of her feeling for Alison, but later accepts the fact that she is a lesbian and starts to date girls. She eventually begins a relationship with Sara Harvey, until she discovers that she is an ally of the antagonist.\n\n===Alison DiLaurentis===\n{{main|Alison DiLaurentis}}\nThe former \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" of her clique, '''Alison DiLaurentis''', portrayed by [[Sasha Pieterse]], used to be the most popular girl in school before her disappearance and alleged death. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their deepest secrets against them to keep them in line. Charming and manipulative, Alison was skilled at finding ways to blackmail everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends are beginning to realize how little they really knew about her. She is revealed to be alive and on the run from \"A.\"\n\n===Mona Vanderwaal===\n{{main|Mona Vanderwaal}}\nA former \"unpopular\" girl at Rosewood, '''Mona Vanderwaal''', portrayed by [[Janel Parrish]], longed to be accepted into Alison's group and was continuously mocked by her. After Alison's disappearance, Mona befriended Hanna and they underwent an \"extreme makeover\" together; as a result, they both became popular students. When \"A\" appears, Mona becomes jealous of Hanna rekindling her friendships with the other Liars. She dislikes Caleb and makes attempts to break Hanna and Caleb up, though to no avail. She becomes romantically involved with Noel, much to Hanna's disapproval, but is later dumped by him for Jenna. When \"A\" begins sending Mona threatening notes, she grows closer to the Liars.

She was taken into police custody where she admits to knowing who killed the girl in Ali's grave and tells them Ali is alive and that she can prove it. Later that night, she escapes and takes a police car. She heads to New York where she asks for Ali's help. It is revealed that Ezra was paying CeCe for information which is why she was in Ravenswood. Ali asked her to wear the Red Coat to distract \"A\" so she could turn off the saw. Alison gives CeCe her plane ticket and CeCe boards a plane to France, under the alias \"Vivian Darkbloom\". In \"Game Over, Charles\", it is revealed that CeCe is actually \"A\" and was born as Charles DiLaurentis. CeCe was admitted to Radley Sanitarium as a child, after a misinterpreted incident involving Alison as a baby. Their parents told Jason that she was imaginary. It is claimed that Charles committed suicide at age 16 so that CeCe could transition into Charlotte DiLaurentis. Mr. DiLaurentis was unaware of CeCe/Charlotte's existence and Charlotte eventually began dating Jason to get closer the family and became CeCe Drake. CeCe/Charlotte was given privileges to leave Radley to attend the University of Pennsylvania, and one night Bethany stole her clothes and escaped to hurt Mrs. DiLaurentis. CeCe stumbled upon Alison and hit her, believing it was Bethany. Later, CeCe made friends with Mona, who told her all about the \"A\" game and the Liars, and CeCe offered her a partnership and she helped CeCe escape, where she became \"A\". Sometime after this, CeCe hired Sara Harvey to become her accomplice by dressing up as Red Coat and The Black Widow. CeCe was also Red Coat, being the one to watch Mona dig up the grave, don the Emily mask and attend the Hoe Down. After declaring game over, Charlotte was admitted to a sanitarium for treatment. Once the Liars discover who she is, she ends the game. Five years later, Alison petitions the court to release Charlotte, asking the girls to testify in her favor. Charlotte is released and brought home to Alison. However, the next morning her body is found, seemingly having jumped from the bell tower, until the police discover that Charlotte was already dead upon \"being thrown\".
