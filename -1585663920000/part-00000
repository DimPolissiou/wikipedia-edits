We can say that the majority of the Bosnian territory was probably occupied by Croats \u2013 or at least, by Slavs under Croat rule \u2013 in the seventh century; but that is a tribal label which has little or no meaning five centuries later. The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism. All that one can sensibly say about the ethnic identity of the Bosnians is this: they were the Slavs who lived in Bosnia.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}}</ref>\n\nAlso, Serbs settled in south, in [[Zahumlje]] and [[Travunija]] (south-east in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina);{{sfn|Fine|1991.|p=53}} it was referred to only once, at the end of the 32nd chapter on the Serbs (a chapter overall drawn from older writings).{{sfn|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}} This is the first mention of a Bosnian entity; at the time it was a geographic, not a national, entity.{{sfn|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}} In the Early Middle Ages, Fine, Jr. believes that what is today western Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of [[Duchy of Croatia|Croatia]], while the east was [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian]],{{sfn|Fine|1991..|p=53}} although, the harsh and usually inaccessible elevated terrains of Upper Bosnia was most likely never under direct control of either of the two Slavic states, but more under its own political rule.

We can say that the majority of the Bosnian territory was probably occupied by Croats \u2013 or at least, by Slavs under Croat rule \u2013 in the seventh century; but that is a tribal label which has little or no meaning five centuries later. The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism.

He is well known for tenure with [[WWE]], where he performed under the ring name '''Dean Ambrose''' from 2011 to 2019.<ref name=\"WWE\"/>\n\nGood began his professional wrestling career under the Jon Moxley name on the American independent circuit in 2004, working for various regional promotions including [[Full Impact Pro]] (FIP), [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), and [[Dragon Gate USA]] (DGUSA). He won several top championships, including the [[FIP World Heavyweight Championship]] once, the [[HWA Heavyweight Championship]] thrice, and the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship]] twice.\n\nAfter signing with WWE in 2011, he took the name Dean Ambrose and competed in their [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territories]] [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW) and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. He joined the main roster in November 2012 as a member of [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]], alongside [[Roman Reigns]] and [[Seth Rollins]]. In May 2013, Ambrose won his first championship in WWE, the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]], while in the group, with his 351-day reign being the [[List of WWE United States Champions|longest under the WWE banner]]. Following The Shield's breakup in June 2014, Ambrose went on to become [[List of WWE Champions|a one-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]], [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|a three-time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]], and [[List of WWE Raw Tag Team Champions|a two-time]] [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Champion]] (with Seth Rollins).

He also started working in NJPW shortly after his WWE exit and won the IWGP United States Championship in his debut, becoming the first and only wrestler to have held the WWE and IWGP United States championships.\n\nOutside of wrestling, Good made his acting debut as the star of the 2015 action film ''[[12 Rounds 3: Lockdown]]'' and will appear in the upcoming action film ''Cagefighter''.\n\n== Early life ==\nJonathan David Good was born in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], on December 7, 1985.<ref name=\"RSHerzog\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/about-face-dean-ambrose-is-the-wwes-unlikely-anti-hero-20141024|title=About Face: Dean Ambrose Is the WWE's Unlikely Anti-Hero|last=Herzog|first=Kenny|date=October 24, 2014|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=October 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025173019/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/about-face-dean-ambrose-is-the-wwes-unlikely-anti-hero-20141024|archive-date=October 25, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"espn prof\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17167094|title=WWE Profile - Dean Ambrose|date=July 28, 2016|website=[[ESPN]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102051103/http://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/17167094|archive-date=January 2, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> An avid wrestling fan who idolized [[Bret Hart]] as a child, he used wrestling as an escape from his rough upbringing by watching wrestling videos and reading stories about wrestling's earlier days.<ref name=slam/><ref name=\"JanM\"/> One year after beginning to train as a wrestler, he dropped out of high school.<ref name=\"JanM\"/> He supported himself by working in factories, restaurants, and warehouses, but was constantly getting fired because he would skip work if he was booked to wrestle a match that clashed with his shift.<ref name=\"TMWFP\">''The Major Wrestling Figure Podcast'', episode: \"[https://mwfpod.podbean.com/e/dean-ambrose/ Dean Ambrose Talks...About Wrestling Figures]\" (February 8, 2019).

He grew up in [[Oklahoma City]] and graduated from Capitol Hill High School in 1941.<ref name=\"SABR\">Rives, Bob. [https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/45655983 \"Joe Bauman\"]. sabr.org. Retrieved May 11, 2019.</ref>\n\n==Professional baseball career==\nBauman debuted in professional baseball with the Newport Dodgers in the [[Northeast Arkansas League]] in 1941.{{when?|date=June 2019}} Hitting only three home runs in 59 games, he also went 0\u201310 as a [[pitcher]] when he was called up to the [[Little Rock Travelers]] in the [[Southern Association]]. During the winter of 1942, he played [[semi-professional]] ball. He served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1943 to 1945, and was stationed at [[Norman Naval Air Station]], where he taught physical fitness and played baseball. During that time, he married his high school sweetheart Dorothy and lived in Oklahoma.\n\nUpon his return in 1946, Bauman settled in with the [[Amarillo Gold Sox]] in the [[West Texas\u2013New Mexico League]]. He led the circuit with 48 home runs, 159 [[runs batted in]], and a .301 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. The following season, his home run totals went down, but his production went up. He hit just 38 homers, but he batted .350 and drew 151 [[base on balls|walks]], and was signed by the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]].\n\nIn 1948, Bauman played in the Braves organization, going 0 for 1 in [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]], and posting fair stats in Class AA (.275, 55 BB, 10 HR in 276 AB), while splitting time with [[Ray Sanders]]. It was Bauman's only time outside of the low minors, and left it inconclusive as to whether he could play in the majors or not.\n\nThe Braves tried to send him to the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]] but wanted to cut his salary. After four years in the U.S. Navy, Bauman was tired of taking orders and walked away.  \"I told them that I could make more money selling 24-inch shoestrings on any corner in Oklahoma City\", he said.  During this era in baseball, most major leaguers did not make much money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/minors/2005-09-20-bauman-obit_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Minor league home run king Bauman dies|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}</ref>\n\nBauman returned to Oklahoma in 1949, signing on for three seasons with the semi-pro [[Elk City, Oklahoma|Elk City]] Elks. He also opened a [[filling station|service station]] on busy [[U.S. Highway 66]] with business partner Jack Riley.<ref name=obituary>{{cite news|last=Korte |first=Tim |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/minors/2005-09-20-bauman-obit_x.htm |title=Minor league home run king Bauman dies |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> The Elks did well, especially in 1949 and 1950, and Bauman was a crowd favorite, known simply as \"Joe.\"  Fans from western Oklahoma and the [[Texas Panhandle]] flocked to watch him knock home runs over the unique red rock wall of Ackley Park. By 1951, the oil-boom economy and the team had begun to lag, though, and Bauman decided to move on.\n\nAt 30, Bauman joined up with the Class C [[Longhorn League]] for 1952, signing with the [[Artesia Drillers]]. During that year, his [[triple crown (baseball)|triple crown]] stats were .375-50-157, good enough to lead the league in homers, RBI, and walks (148). The next year, he led the league in walks (130), [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] (135), and home runs (53), while maintaining a high average. After the season, he moved to Roswell.\n\nThe [[Roswell Rockets]]' ballpark had a right field wall that was 329 feet from home. It was a prime target for Bauman, who was a left-handed pull hitter with an uppercut swing. In 1954, Bauman won the triple crown and also led the league in runs and walks for Roswell. In 138 games, he had 199 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 498 at bats for a .400 average. He also drove in 228 runs and walked 150 times. He hit 35 doubles, 3 triples, and 72 home runs \u2013 the latter, a professional baseball record<ref name=InvisibleFastball/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vQQkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ByQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2372,2300221 |title=Joe Bauman Sets Record, Runs Home Run Total to 72 |agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=September 7, 1954 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> that stood until [[Barry Bonds]] topped it in 2001.<ref name=obituary/> The previous record had been 69, and Bauman hit 13 home runs in the last 14 games to break the mark. He also became the first professional player to hit 50 in three straight seasons. \"That summer the ball looked this big,\" he later said, circling an area the size of a ripe cantaloupe with his hands.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\nRoswell was a small town, and Bauman was the biggest local attraction since the 1947 crash and suspected alien landing. After each home run, fans pushed dollar bills through the fence, and the game had to be stopped for a few minutes to collect all the money.\n\nBauman could not duplicate his 1954 season in 1955, hitting 46 home runs with a [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .336. The following season, he played just 52 games and hit 17 homers. He retired in 1956 at age 34. For his professional baseball career, Bauman's statistics were: 1,019 games, 982 runs scored, 1,166 hits, 337 home runs, 1,057 runs batted in, 974 walks, and a .337 batting average.

During the winter of 1942, he played [[semi-professional]] ball. He served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1943 to 1945, and was stationed at [[Norman Naval Air Station]], where he taught physical fitness and played baseball. During that time, he married his high school sweetheart Dorothy and lived in Oklahoma.\n\nUpon his return in 1946, Bauman settled in with the [[Amarillo Gold Sox]] in the [[West Texas\u2013New Mexico League]]. He led the circuit with 48 home runs, 159 [[runs batted in]], and a .301 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. The following season, his home run totals went down, but his production went up. He hit just 38 homers, but he batted .350 and drew 151 [[base on balls|walks]], and was signed by the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]].\n\nIn 1948, Bauman played in the Braves organization, going 0 for 1 in [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]], and posting fair stats in Class AA (.275, 55 BB, 10 HR in 276 AB), while splitting time with [[Ray Sanders]]. It was Bauman's only time outside of the low minors, and left it inconclusive as to whether he could play in the majors or not.\n\nThe Braves tried to send him to the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]] but wanted to cut his salary. After four years in the U.S. Navy, Bauman was tired of taking orders and walked away.  \"I told them that I could make more money selling 24-inch shoestrings on any corner in Oklahoma City\", he said.  During this era in baseball, most major leaguers did not make much money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/minors/2005-09-20-bauman-obit_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Minor league home run king Bauman dies|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}</ref>\n\nBauman returned to Oklahoma in 1949, signing on for three seasons with the semi-pro [[Elk City, Oklahoma|Elk City]] Elks.

By 1951, the oil-boom economy and the team had begun to lag, though, and Bauman decided to move on.\n\nAt 30, Bauman joined up with the Class C [[Longhorn League]] for 1952, signing with the [[Artesia Drillers]]. During that year, his [[triple crown (baseball)|triple crown]] stats were .375-50-157, good enough to lead the league in homers, RBI, and walks (148). The next year, he led the league in walks (130), [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] (135), and home runs (53), while maintaining a high average. After the season, he moved to Roswell.\n\nThe [[Roswell Rockets]]' ballpark had a right field wall that was 329 feet from home. It was a prime target for Bauman, who was a left-handed pull hitter with an uppercut swing. In 1954, Bauman won the triple crown and also led the league in runs and walks for Roswell. In 138 games, he had 199 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 498 at bats for a .400 average. He also drove in 228 runs and walked 150 times.

After each home run, fans pushed dollar bills through the fence, and the game had to be stopped for a few minutes to collect all the money.\n\nBauman could not duplicate his 1954 season in 1955, hitting 46 home runs with a [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .336. The following season, he played just 52 games and hit 17 homers. He retired in 1956 at age 34. For his professional baseball career, Bauman's statistics were: 1,019 games, 982 runs scored, 1,166 hits, 337 home runs, 1,057 runs batted in, 974 walks, and a .337 batting average.

In 1963, after a four-year interdiction due to her father's status, she again published in ''[[Contemporanul]]'' (edited by [[George Iva\u0219cu]]).\n \nHer editorial debut took place in 1964 with the booklet of poems ''Persoana \u00eent\u00e2ia plural'' (\"First Person Plural\"), with a ''Foreword'' written by [[Nicolae Manolescu]]. She became known for her ''Calc\u00e2iul vulnerabil'' (\"Achilles' Heel\", 1966) and ''A treia tain\u0103'' (\"The Third Secret\", 1969). In 1966, Blandiana appeared for the first time at the International Poem Contest (in [[Lathi, Finland|Lahti]], [[Finland]]).\n \nIn 1967, she settled in [[Bucharest]]; until the following year, she was one of the editors for ''Via\u021ba studen\u021beasc\u0103'', and then (until 1975) worked as editor for ''Amfiteatru''. \nShe gave two televised readings in 1969, in the company of [[Andrei \u0218erban]] and the actors Irina Petrescu, Mariana Mihu\u021b and [[Florian Pitti\u015f]].\n \nBetween 1975 and 1977, she was a librarian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest. In 1976, her works were first printed in a [[French language|French]] translation, in ''Croisi\u00e8re du Club des Po\u00e8tes'' by [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Rosnay]] ([[Paris]]); in 1978, she took part in the First International Festival of Poetry in Paris organized by the famed [[Club des Po\u00e8tes]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, assuming risks of reprisals of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Blandiana started writing protest poems, in answer to the increasingly harsh demands of the system in general.\n\nIn 1984 Blandiana's poem 'Totul' ('Everything') was briefly published in the literary magazine Amfiteatru. 'Totul' was a list of elements of everyday life in Bucharest at the time, composed as a comment on the contrast between the official view of life in Romania and the alternative perception of its monotonous shabbiness. The critical nature of the poem led to the edition of Amfiteatru being withdrawn within hours of publication with the editors being dismissed. Nevertheless, the poem appeared in translation in Western media and also had limited underground circulation in Romania.[http://www.beyondtheforest.com/Romania/RSR4.html]\n\nIn 1987 she published at the Sport-Turism Publishing House the book \"Ora\u0219e de silabe\" (\"City of syllables\") where she writes about all the countries and cities of the world where she traveled in spite of the communist dictatorship: over 100. The same year, 1987, she is published in USSR, at Raduga Publishing House from Moscow, with the Russian title ''Stihotvorenia, rasskaz\u00ee, asse''. Even though the secret services of Ceau\u0219escu ('Securitate') attribute her a dissident status, in 1989 the Minerva Publishing House is publishing in the most popular mass collection \"Biblioteca Pentru To\u021bi\" (\"Library for all people\") an anthology of her poems. Her friends sustain that the book never seen the bookshelves of the libraries.

She left literary work in the background, although she did publish ''Arhitectura valurilor'' (\"Waves' Architecture\", 1990), ''100 de poeme'' (\"100 Poems\", 1991), and ''Sertarul cu aplauze'' (\"The Drawer of Applause\", prose, 1992). In 1992 she advocates for the released from prison of old time Party member Gheorghe 'Gogu' Radulescu, a former member of the Executive Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and protector of herself during the communist period.\n\nAna Blandiana has also published: ''50 de poeme'', (\"50 Poems\"), 1970: ''Octombrie, Noiembrie, Decembrie'' (\"October, November, December\"), 1972; ''\u00cent\u00e2mpl\u0103ri din gr\u0103dina mea'' (''Occurrences in My Garden''), 1980; ''Ora de nisip'' (\"The Hour of Sand\"), 1984; ''\u00cent\u00e2mpl\u0103ri de pe strada mea'' (''Occurrences on My Street''), 1988; ''\u00cen diminea\u021ba de dup\u0103 moarte'' (\"On the Morning After Dying\"), 1996; ''La cules \u00eengeri'' (\"Angel Gathering\"), 1997; ''Cartea alb\u0103 a lui Arpagic'' (\"Arpagic's White Book\"), 1998.

In 1976, her works were first printed in a [[French language|French]] translation, in ''Croisi\u00e8re du Club des Po\u00e8tes'' by [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Rosnay]] ([[Paris]]); in 1978, she took part in the First International Festival of Poetry in Paris organized by the famed [[Club des Po\u00e8tes]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, assuming risks of reprisals of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Blandiana started writing protest poems, in answer to the increasingly harsh demands of the system in general.\n\nIn 1984 Blandiana's poem 'Totul' ('Everything') was briefly published in the literary magazine Amfiteatru. 'Totul' was a list of elements of everyday life in Bucharest at the time, composed as a comment on the contrast between the official view of life in Romania and the alternative perception of its monotonous shabbiness. The critical nature of the poem led to the edition of Amfiteatru being withdrawn within hours of publication with the editors being dismissed. Nevertheless, the poem appeared in translation in Western media and also had limited underground circulation in Romania.[http://www.beyondtheforest.com/Romania/RSR4.html]\n\nIn 1987 she published at the Sport-Turism Publishing House the book \"Ora\u0219e de silabe\" (\"City of syllables\") where she writes about all the countries and cities of the world where she traveled in spite of the communist dictatorship: over 100. The same year, 1987, she is published in USSR, at Raduga Publishing House from Moscow, with the Russian title ''Stihotvorenia, rasskaz\u00ee, asse''. Even though the secret services of Ceau\u0219escu ('Securitate') attribute her a dissident status, in 1989 the Minerva Publishing House is publishing in the most popular mass collection \"Biblioteca Pentru To\u021bi\" (\"Library for all people\") an anthology of her poems. Her friends sustain that the book never seen the bookshelves of the libraries. However, \"Poezii\" (\"Poems\") has a 'Foreword' written by [[Eugen Simion]].[http://civicmedia.ro/acm/index.php?option=com_conent&task=view&id=529&Itemid=96]\n\nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], she entered political life, campaigning for the removal of the communist legacy from administrative office, as well as for an [[open society]]. She left literary work in the background, although she did publish ''Arhitectura valurilor'' (\"Waves' Architecture\", 1990), ''100 de poeme'' (\"100 Poems\", 1991), and ''Sertarul cu aplauze'' (\"The Drawer of Applause\", prose, 1992). In 1992 she advocates for the released from prison of old time Party member Gheorghe 'Gogu' Radulescu, a former member of the Executive Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and protector of herself during the communist period.\n\nAna Blandiana has also published: ''50 de poeme'', (\"50 Poems\"), 1970: ''Octombrie, Noiembrie, Decembrie'' (\"October, November, December\"), 1972; ''\u00cent\u00e2mpl\u0103ri din gr\u0103dina mea'' (''Occurrences in My Garden''), 1980; ''Ora de nisip'' (\"The Hour of Sand\"), 1984; ''\u00cent\u00e2mpl\u0103ri de pe strada mea'' (''Occurrences on My Street''), 1988; ''\u00cen diminea\u021ba de dup\u0103 moarte'' (\"On the Morning After Dying\"), 1996; ''La cules \u00eengeri'' (\"Angel Gathering\"), 1997; ''Cartea alb\u0103 a lui Arpagic'' (\"Arpagic's White Book\"), 1998. She has also authored 6 books of essays and 4 books of other prose writings. Her work was translated into 16 languages.\n\n''Ora de nisip'' (\"The Hour of Sand\") has been translated into English by Peter Jay and Anca Cristofovici.<ref>Published by Anvil Press Poetry Ltd, London, 1990, {{ISBN|9780856462405}}</ref>\n\n== Presence in English language anthologies ==\n\n* ''Testament \u2013 Anthology of Modern Romanian Verse / Testament - Antologie de Poezie Rom\u00e2n\u0103 Modern\u0103 \u2013 Bilingual Edition English & Romanian'' \u2013 [[Daniel Ionita]] (editor and translator) with Eva Foster and Daniel Reynaud \u2013 [[Editura Minerva|Minerva]]Publishing 2012 and 2015 (second edition) - {{ISBN|978-973-21-1006-5}}\n* ''Testament - Anthology of Romanian Verse - American Edition -'' monolingual English language edition - [[Daniel Ionita]] (editor and principal translator) with Eva Foster, Daniel Reynaud and Rochelle Bews - Australian-Romanian Academy for Culture - 2017 - {{ISBN|978-0-9953502-0-5}}\n* ''Born in Utopia - An anthology of Modern and Contemporary Romanian Poetry -'' Carmen Firan and Paul Doru Mugur (editors) with Edward Foster - Talisman House Publishers - 2006 - {{ISBN|1-58498-050-8}}\n\n==Affiliations==\n* Member of the [[Writers' Union of Romania]]\n* Member of the European Academy of Poetry\n* Chairman of the Romanian [[PEN American Center|PEN Club]], after its re-establishment  in 1990\n* 1994 - Founder and leader of the [[Civic Alliance Foundation]], a Romanian non-party movement, whose aim was to alleviate the consequences of more than fifty years of communism in Romania.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120205235700/http://www.aliantacivica.ro/organizare/ana_blandiana.htm Biography at the Civic Alliance site]\n*{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.liternet.ro/autor/14/Ana-Blandiana.html Books and other writings by Ana Bladiana at LiterNet.ro site]\n*{{in lang|ro}} [http://civicmedia.ro/acm/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=529&Itemid=96 Biography and propaganda poems at the Civic Media site including her profile made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party]\n\n{{Herder Prize}}\n{{svplaureats}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blandiana, Ana}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Timi\u0219oara]]\n[[Category:People of the Romanian Revolution]]\n[[Category:Romanian activists]]\n[[Category:Romanian women activists]]\n[[Category:Romanian children's writers]]\n[[Category:Romanian essayists]]\n[[Category:Romanian journalists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Romanian poets]]\n[[Category:Romanian women short story writers]]\n[[Category:Romanian short story writers]]\n[[Category:Romanian women writers]]\n[[Category:Romanian women essayists]]\n[[Category:Women children's writers]]\n[[Category:Romanian women poets]]\n[[Category:International Writing Program alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century short story writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century essayists]]\n[[Category:Herder Prize recipients]]\n[[Category:20th-century Romanian women writers]]\n[[Category:Struga Poetry Evenings Golden Wreath laureates]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Timi\u0219oara(viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Blandiana"}

According to the Roman law ''res nullius'', or things without an owner, such as wild animals (''ferae beastiae''), lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure.\n\nA part of the debate over the history of ''terra nullius'' is when the term itself was first used. According to [[historian of ideas]] Andrew Fitzmaurice, ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' were two different, albeit related, legal terms. He claims that ''territorium nullius'' was first used in a meeting of the [[Institut de Droit International]] in 1888 where the legal principles of the [[Berlin conference]] were discussed and that ''terra nullius'' was introduced twenty years later during legal disputes over the polar regions.<ref name=\"surplusvalue.org.au\">http://surplusvalue.org.au/Misc%20Articles%20and%20Poems/terra%20nullius%20copy.pdf</ref> Historian Michael Connor on the other hand, argues that ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' are the same thing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunray22b.net/truth_or_not_in_academic_accusations.htm|title=Null truth to academic accusations|author=|date=|website=www.sunray22b.net|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> Both scholars are active in the [[Australia]]n [[history wars]] debate.\n\nThere is considerable debate among historians about how and when the ''terra nullius'' concepts were used. The debate has been especially prevalent in Australia where it was ignited by the history wars caused by the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo case]] in 1992. The history wars caused Australian historians to reevaluate the country's history, the dispossession of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] and whether the land should best be characterized as having been \"settled\" or \"conquered\". A part of this debate concerned whether ''terra nullius'' as a concept was ever used by England and other European powers to justify territorial conquest.\n\nOn one side of the debate are historians such as [[Alan Frost]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] who claim that in the 15th and 16th century, European writers adopted the ''res nullius'' concept for territorial conquest. Frost writes:\n\n{{quote|By the mid\u2013eighteenth century, the theoretical basis of a new convention of acquiring empire had emerged. If a European state (a Christian Prince) had already established an effective possession of a region, another might acquire title to it only by formal cession (which might or might not involve outright purchase). If the region was not already possessed by a rival, then a state might acquire it in one of three ways, viz.: \u2013 by persuading the indigenous inhabitants to submit themselves to its overlordship; \u2013 by purchasing from those inhabitants the right to settle part or parts of it; \u2013 by unilateral possession, on the basis of first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\">http://samuelgriffith.org.au/docs/vol1/chap11.pdf</ref>}}\n\nHistorians debate whether \"first discovery and effective occupation\" was applied to territory inhabited by [[indigenous people]] that European empires sought to acquire or not. According to Frost:\n\n{{quote|However, if the indigenes had advanced beyond the state of nature only so far as to have developed language and the community of the family, but no further; if they had not yet mixed their labour with the earth in any permanent way; or if the region were literally uninhabited, then Europeans considered it to be terra nullius (i.e., belonging to no one), to which they might gain permanent title by first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\"/>}}\n\nOn the other side of the debate are historians which claim that ''terra nullius'' is a much younger concept, which did not become formalized before the end of the 19th century. Historian Merete Borch writes:\n\n{{quote|When the wealth of material relevant to this issue is surveyed it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless, nor was this the basis of official policy, in the eighteenth century or before. Rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century.<ref>http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/76.pdf</ref>}}\n\nThese historians claim instead that territorial conquest was justified from natural law &mdash; that which has no owner can be taken by the first taker. Michael Connor in his book \"The Invention of Terra Nullius\" takes an even more extreme view and argues that no one in the 19th century thought of Australia as being ''terra nullius''.  He calls the concept a [[legal fiction]], a straw man developed in the late 20th century:\n\n{{quote|By the time of Mabo in 1992, terra nullius was the only explanation for the British settlement of Australia. Historians, more interested in politics than archives, misled the legal profession into believing that a phrase no one had heard of a few years before was the very basis of our statehood, and Reynolds' version of our history, especially The Law of the Land, underpinned the Mabo judges' decision-making.<ref>Michael Connor in ''The Bulletin'' (Sydney), 20 August 2003: (see further Connor 2005.)</ref>}}\n\n==Current claims of ''terra nullius''==\nFew territories are currently considered ''terra nullius''.\n\n===Bir Tawil===\n[[File:Egypt Sudan claims.svg|thumb|upright|Simplified map showing Egypt's territory (yellow), Sudan's territory (blue), disputed territory (green) and unclaimed Bir Tawil (white)]]\n\n[[Bir Tawil]] is an example of a territory often claimed to be ''terra nullius''.<ref>There is some disagreement of whether Bir Tawil is 'terra nullius'' or not.

Both countries assert the border that lets them claim the Hala'ib Triangle, which is significantly larger (than Bir Tawil) and next to the [[Red Sea]], with the side effect that Bir Tawil is unclaimed by either nation.

According to the Roman law ''res nullius'', or things without an owner, such as wild animals (''ferae beastiae''), lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure.\n\nA part of the debate over the history of ''terra nullius'' is when the term itself was first used. According to [[historian of ideas]] Andrew Fitzmaurice, ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' were two different, albeit related, legal terms. He claims that ''territorium nullius'' was first used in a meeting of the [[Institut de Droit International]] in 1888 where the legal principles of the [[Berlin conference]] were discussed and that ''terra nullius'' was introduced twenty years later during legal disputes over the polar regions.<ref name=\"surplusvalue.org.au\">http://surplusvalue.org.au/Misc%20Articles%20and%20Poems/terra%20nullius%20copy.pdf</ref> Historian Michael Connor on the other hand, argues that ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' are the same thing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunray22b.net/truth_or_not_in_academic_accusations.htm|title=Null truth to academic accusations|author=|date=|website=www.sunray22b.net|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> Both scholars are active in the [[Australia]]n [[history wars]] debate.\n\nThere is considerable debate among historians about how and when the ''terra nullius'' concepts were used. The debate has been especially prevalent in Australia where it was ignited by the history wars caused by the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo case]] in 1992. The history wars caused Australian historians to reevaluate the country's history, the dispossession of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] and whether the land should best be characterized as having been \"settled\" or \"conquered\". A part of this debate concerned whether ''terra nullius'' as a concept was ever used by England and other European powers to justify territorial conquest.\n\nOn one side of the debate are historians such as [[Alan Frost]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] who claim that in the 15th and 16th century, European writers adopted the ''res nullius'' concept for territorial conquest. Frost writes:\n\n{{quote|By the mid\u2013eighteenth century, the theoretical basis of a new convention of acquiring empire had emerged. If a European state (a Christian Prince) had already established an effective possession of a region, another might acquire title to it only by formal cession (which might or might not involve outright purchase). If the region was not already possessed by a rival, then a state might acquire it in one of three ways, viz.: \u2013 by persuading the indigenous inhabitants to submit themselves to its overlordship; \u2013 by purchasing from those inhabitants the right to settle part or parts of it; \u2013 by unilateral possession, on the basis of first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\">http://samuelgriffith.org.au/docs/vol1/chap11.pdf</ref>}}\n\nHistorians debate whether \"first discovery and effective occupation\" was applied to territory inhabited by [[indigenous people]] that European empires sought to acquire or not. According to Frost:\n\n{{quote|However, if the indigenes had advanced beyond the state of nature only so far as to have developed language and the community of the family, but no further; if they had not yet mixed their labour with the earth in any permanent way; or if the region were literally uninhabited, then Europeans considered it to be terra nullius (i.e., belonging to no one), to which they might gain permanent title by first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\"/>}}\n\nOn the other side of the debate are historians which claim that ''terra nullius'' is a much younger concept, which did not become formalized before the end of the 19th century. Historian Merete Borch writes:\n\n{{quote|When the wealth of material relevant to this issue is surveyed it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless, nor was this the basis of official policy, in the eighteenth century or before. Rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century.<ref>http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/76.pdf</ref>}}\n\nThese historians claim instead that territorial conquest was justified from natural law &mdash; that which has no owner can be taken by the first taker. Michael Connor in his book \"The Invention of Terra Nullius\" takes an even more extreme view and argues that no one in the 19th century thought of Australia as being ''terra nullius''.  He calls the concept a [[legal fiction]], a straw man developed in the late 20th century:\n\n{{quote|By the time of Mabo in 1992, terra nullius was the only explanation for the British settlement of Australia. Historians, more interested in politics than archives, misled the legal profession into believing that a phrase no one had heard of a few years before was the very basis of our statehood, and Reynolds' version of our history, especially The Law of the Land, underpinned the Mabo judges' decision-making.<ref>Michael Connor in ''The Bulletin'' (Sydney), 20 August 2003: (see further Connor 2005.)</ref>}}\n\n==Current claims of ''terra nullius''==\nFew territories are currently considered ''terra nullius''.\n\n===Bir Tawil===\n[[File:Egypt Sudan claims.svg|thumb|upright|Simplified map showing Egypt's territory (yellow), Sudan's territory (blue), disputed territory (green) and unclaimed Bir Tawil (white)]]\n\n[[Bir Tawil]] is an example of a territory often claimed to be ''terra nullius''.<ref>There is some disagreement of whether Bir Tawil is 'terra nullius'' or not.

Both countries assert the border that lets them claim the Hala'ib Triangle, which is significantly larger (than Bir Tawil) and next to the [[Red Sea]], with the side effect that Bir Tawil is unclaimed by either nation.

Signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] of 1959 agreed not to make such claims, except the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], who reserved the right to make a claim.\n\n==Historical claims of ''terra nullius''==\nSeveral territories have been claimed to be ''terra nullius''. In a minority of those claims, international and domestic courts have ruled on whether the territory is or was ''terra nullius'' or not.\n\n===Australia===\n[[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples]] inhabited Australia for over 65,000 years before [[European settlement of Australia|European settlement]], which commenced in 1788.  [[Customary law in Australia|Indigenous customs, rituals and laws]] were unwritten. It has been claimed that Australia was considered ''terra nullius'' at the time of settlement.

Unlike [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]], she has not had a race problem to solve\".<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'', \"Our higher ambitions\", 1 January 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1971, in the controversial case of ''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'', popularly known as the Gove land rights case, [[Richard Blackburn|Justice Richard Blackburn]] ruled that Australia had been considered \"desert and uncultivated\" (a term which included territory in which resided \"uncivilized inhabitants in a primitive state of society\") before European settlement, and therefore, by the law that applied at the time, open to be claimed by right of occupancy, and that there was no such thing as [[native title]] in [[Law of Australia|Australian law]]. The concept of ''terra nullius'' was not considered in this case, however.<ref name=\"Milirrpum\">''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'' (1971) 17 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 141 (27 April 1971) [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory|Supreme Court]] (NT).</ref> Court cases in 1977, 1979, and 1982 &ndash; brought by or on behalf of Aboriginal activists &ndash; challenged Australian sovereignty on the grounds that ''terra nullius'' had been improperly applied, therefore Aboriginal sovereignty should still be regarded as being intact. The courts rejected these cases, but the Australian High Court left the door open for a reassessment of whether the continent should be considered \"settled\" or \"conquered\". Later, on 1 February 2014, the traditional owners of land on [[Badu Island]] received freehold title to 10,000 hectare in an act of the [[Queensland Government]].<ref>''Torres News'', 10\u201316 February 2014</ref>\n\nIn 1982, [[Eddie Mabo]] and four other [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Strait Islanders]] from Mer ([[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]]) started legal proceedings to establish their traditional land ownership. This led to ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 1)]]''. In 1992, after ten years of hearings before the [[Queensland Supreme Court]] and the [[High Court of Australia]], the latter court found that the Mer people had owned their land prior to annexation by Queensland.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200706/s1941005.htm\n|title= Indigenous people still battle for land rights: activist\n|accessdate= 3 July 2011\n|date= 3 June 2007\n|work= ABC News Online\n|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref>\nThe ruling thus had far-reaching significance for the land claims of both Torres Strait Islanders and other Indigenous Australians.\n\nThe controversy over Australian land ownership erupted into the so-called \"[[history wars]]\". The 1992 Mabo decision overturned the doctrine of ''terra nullius'' in Australia.<ref>https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/native-title-research/overturning-doctrine-terra%20nullius-the-mabo-case.pdf</ref>\n\n===Svalbard===\n[[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] or [[Great Britain]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] all claimed sovereignty over the archipelago of [[Svalbard]] in the seventeenth century, but none permanently occupied it. Expeditions from each of these polities visited Svalbard principally during the summer for [[whaling]], with the first two sending a few wintering parties in the 1620s and 1630s.<ref name=\"surplusvalue.org.au\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, both [[Norway]] and [[Russia]] made strong claims to the archipelago. In 1909, Italian jurist Camille Piccioni described [[Spitzbergen]], as it was then known, as ''terra nullius'':\n\n{{quote|The issue would have been simpler if Spitzbergen, until now terra nullius, could have been attributed to a single state, for reasons of neighbouring or earlier occupation. But this is not the case and several powers can, for different reasons, make their claims to this territory which still has no master.<ref>Camille Piccioni, Revue generale de droit international public vol. XVI (1909)</ref>}}\n\nThe territorial dispute was eventually resolved by the [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 9 February 1920 which recognized [[Norway|Norwegian]] sovereignty over the islands.\n\n===Eastern Greenland===\n[[Norway]] occupied and claimed parts of (then uninhabited) eastern [[Greenland]] in 1931, claiming that it constituted ''terra nullius'' and calling the territory [[Erik the Red's Land]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/the-cold-war-that-wasnt-norway-annexes-greenland\n|title= The Cold War that Wasn't: Norway Annexes Greenland\n|first= Frank|last= Jacobs|date=4 March 2015\n|website= bigthink.com|accessdate= 30 March 2018\n}}\n</ref>\nThe [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] ruled against the Norwegian claim. The Norwegians accepted the ruling and withdrew their claim.\n\n===Scarborough Shoal (South China Sea) ===\nThe [[Philippines]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] both claim the [[Scarborough Shoal]] or Panatag Shoal or Huangyan Island (\u9ec4\u5ca9\u5c9b), nearest to the island of [[Luzon]], located in the [[South China Sea]]. The Philippines claims it under the principles of ''terra nullius'' and EEZ ([[Exclusive Economic Zone]]). China's claim refers to its discovery in the 13th century by Chinese fishermen. (The former [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949) | Nationalist government on the Chinese mainland]] had also claimed this territory after the founding of the [[Republic of China]] in 1911.) However, despite China's position of non-participation in an [[UNCLOS]] case, in 2016 the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration | PCA]] denied the lawfulness of China's \"[[Nine-Dash Line]]\" claim.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Despite this, China continues to build artificial islands in the South China Sea, and Scarborough Shoal is a prime location{{cn|date=October 2019}} for another one. Chinese ships have been seen in the vicinity of the shoal.

Guerin|Guerin v. The Queen]]'', a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on aboriginal rights, the Court stated that the government has a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]] toward the First Nations of Canada and established aboriginal title to be a [[sui generis]] right. Since then there has been a more complicated debate and a general narrowing of the definition of \"fiduciary duty\".\n\n===Guano Islands===\nThe [[Guano Islands Act]] of 18 August 1856 enabled citizens of the U.S. to take possession of islands containing [[guano]] deposits. The islands can be located anywhere, so long as they are not occupied and not within the jurisdiction of other governments. It also empowers the President of the United States to use the military to protect such interests, and establishes the criminal jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n===Pinnacle Islands (Senkaku/Diaoyu)===\nA [[Senkaku Islands dispute|disputed archipelago]] in the [[East China Sea]], the uninhabited [[Senkaku Islands]], are claimed by Japan to have become part of its territory as ''terra nullius'' in January 1895, following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].  However, this interpretation is not accepted by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), both of whom claim sovereignty over the islands.\n\n===Burkina Faso and Niger===\nA narrow strip of land adjacent to two territorial markers along the [[Burkina Faso]]\u2013[[Niger]] border was claimed by neither country until the [[International Court of Justice]] settled a more extensive territorial dispute in 2013. The former unclaimed territory was awarded to Niger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/149/judgments |title=Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders: Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger) |publisher=International Court of Justice|date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2017-08-04}}</ref>\n\n===Clipperton Island===\nThe sovereignty of [[Clipperton Island]] was settled by arbitration between France and Mexico. King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] of Italy rendered a decision in 1931 that {{\"'}}the sovereignty of Clipperton Island belongs to France from the date of November 17, 1858.' The Mexican claim was rejected for lack of proof of prior Spanish discovery and, in any event, no effective occupation by Mexico before 1858, when the island was therefore ''territorium nullius'', and the French occupation then was sufficient and legally continuing.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Boundaries, possessions, and conflicts in Central and North America and the Caribbean| page=320|year=1941|last=Ireland| first=Gordon|publisher=Octagon Books|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n===Rockall===\nAccording to Ian Mitchell, [[Rockall]] was ''terra nullius'' until it was claimed by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1955.<ref name=isles>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QM-8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT232#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Isles of the North |author=Ian Mitchell |publisher=[[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]] |date=2012 |page=232|isbn=9780857900999 |author-link=Ian Mitchell (author) }}</ref>  It was formally annexed in 1972.<ref name=isles /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm |title=1955: Britain claims Rockall |series=On This Day: 21 September |work=[[BBC]]|date=21 September 1955 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/2/pdfs/ukpga_19720002_en.pdf |title=Island Of Rockall Act 1972 |website=[[legislation.gov.uk]] |date=10 February 1972}}</ref>\n\n===Sealand===\nOne of the few micronations to control a physical location, the [[Principality of Sealand]] has existed de facto since 1967 on an abandoned British anti-aircraft gun tower in the North Sea.
