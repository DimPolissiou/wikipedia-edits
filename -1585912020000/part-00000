She is known to the Indo-Canadian community as Toronto's Nightingale. People have come to know her through her YouTube presence through her channel and a collaboration with the South Asian a cappella group [[Penn Masala]]; even [[A.R. Rahman]] discovered her vocal talent through her YouTube channel. She has grown in her career as an award-winning Playback Singer. Her singing debut in Bollywood started through [[Chennai Express]] title track (in 2013).<ref name=\"tele\">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140227/jsp/t2/story_18024754.jsp#.U8JsFfl_toR|title=From a YouTube sensation to a Bolly playback, Toronto girl Jonita Gandhi sings to t2|newspaper=The Telegraph India.com|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newswala.com/Entertainment-News/Jonita-Gandhi-sings-on-the-tunes-of-AR-Rahman-in-the-upcoming-Bollywood-film-Highway-56755.html|title=Jonita Gandhi sings on the tunes of AR Rahman in the upcoming Bollywood film 'Highway'|publisher=News Wala.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714014205/http://www.newswala.com/Entertainment-News/Jonita-Gandhi-sings-on-the-tunes-of-AR-Rahman-in-the-upcoming-Bollywood-film-Highway-56755.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonitagandhi.com/#!about/c10fk|title=Jonita Gandhi|work=Jonita Gandhi}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nJonita Gandhi was born in [[New Delhi]], India. She moved to [[Canada]] with her family when she was a few months old and grew up in [[Brampton]]-[[Toronto]] area. Her father, Deepak Gandhi, a musician by hobby and an electronics engineer by profession, recognized her potential and encouraged her to sing. She first performed in 2005 at a gig at her father's show in Toronto at a Christmas event and the years to follow became prosperous for her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.bramptonguardian.com/community-story/4468868-bollywood-crooner-from-brampton-enroute-to-stardom|title=Bollywood crooner from Brampton enroute to stardom {{!}} BramptonGuardian.com|last=Panjwani|first=Radhika|date=2014-04-16|work=BramptonGuardian.com|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nJonita attended the University of Western Ontario where she completed her degrees in health science and business. During university, she worked an internship at CIBC World Markets, but continued to sing and perform throughout her education. She has had formal training in Western and Hindustani classical singing.<ref name=\"ndtv\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/music/jonita-gandhi-lucky-my-first-bollywood-song-for-shah-rukh-khan-starrer-389250|title=Jonita Gandhi: Lucky my first Bollywood song for Shah Rukh Khan-starrer|publisher=NDTV.com|date=8 July 2013|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"theh\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-voice-that-touched-big-bs-heart/article4018718.ece|title=A voice that touched Big B\u2019s heart|newspaper=The Hindu.com|date= 21 October 2012|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nJonita Gandhi's professional music career started with YouTube cover songs in collaboration with [[Aakash Gandhi]] when she was 17. The videos quickly went viral and led to a myriad of opportunities to perform. Her hits on YouTube began with covers of well-known Hindi-film songs, such as ''Someone Like You'', ''Pani Da Rang'', ''Tujhko Jo Paaya'', ''Tum Hi Ho'', ''Suhaani Raat'', ''Yeh Honsla'' and many others. Her beginning concerts typically consisted of these covers.<ref name=\"ndtv\"/>\n\nHer jump to playback singing began with an opportunity to perform alongside [[Sonu Nigam]]. This tour crossed various countries including [[Russia]], [[UK]], [[US]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Afterward, her sights were set on starting a career in the Bollywood music industry. On the heels of Sonu Nigam's world tour, Jonita stepped into the world of playback singing with a debut in [[Chennai Express]] starring [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Deepika Padukone]]. The music for this film was composed by [[Vishal\u2013Shekhar]] and her feature in the song was happen-stance; it was during a meeting with Vishal-Shekhar's mix engineer Abhishek Ghatak. She further solidified her place in [[Bollywood]] with the movie [[Highway (2014 Hindi film)|Highway]], singing both ''Kahaan Hoon Main'' and ''Implosive Silence''.<ref name=\"ibn\">{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/my-efforts-have-paid-off-with-highway-says-singer-jonita-gandhi/450139-8-66.html|title=My efforts have paid off with 'Highway', says singer Jonita Gandhi|date=5 February 2014|publisher=IBN Live.in.com|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nJonita's work as a playback singer has significantly expanded since and she has been nominated for several awards. Her relevance stems from positive association with multiple extremely successful music directors, ranging from [[A. R. Rahman]] to [[Pritam]] and more. Rahman featured Jonita in the concert film [[One Heart (film)]] and, like many other music directors, typically requests Jonita to perform with him at concerts; in example Jonita performed at the 2016 Jubilee Games in Dubai with [[Salim\u2013Sulaiman]] and [[Amit Trivedi]] on [[MTV Unplugged (India)|MTV Unplugged]].<ref name=\"news\" />\n\n[[The Breakup Song (Indian song)|The Breakup Song]] is her most successful song to-date and has brought her many award nominations and wider recognition.

She is an adaptable [[virtuoso]] who sings in a variety of languages including English, French, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. She is known to the Indo-Canadian community as Toronto's Nightingale. People have come to know her through her YouTube presence through her channel and a collaboration with the South Asian a cappella group [[Penn Masala]]; even [[A.R. Rahman]] discovered her vocal talent through her YouTube channel. She has grown in her career as an award-winning Playback Singer. Her singing debut in Bollywood started through [[Chennai Express]] title track (in 2013).<ref name=\"tele\">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140227/jsp/t2/story_18024754.jsp#.U8JsFfl_toR|title=From a YouTube sensation to a Bolly playback, Toronto girl Jonita Gandhi sings to t2|newspaper=The Telegraph India.com|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newswala.com/Entertainment-News/Jonita-Gandhi-sings-on-the-tunes-of-AR-Rahman-in-the-upcoming-Bollywood-film-Highway-56755.html|title=Jonita Gandhi sings on the tunes of AR Rahman in the upcoming Bollywood film 'Highway'|publisher=News Wala.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714014205/http://www.newswala.com/Entertainment-News/Jonita-Gandhi-sings-on-the-tunes-of-AR-Rahman-in-the-upcoming-Bollywood-film-Highway-56755.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonitagandhi.com/#!about/c10fk|title=Jonita Gandhi|work=Jonita Gandhi}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nJonita Gandhi was born in [[New Delhi]], India. She moved to [[Canada]] with her family when she was a few months old and grew up in [[Brampton]]-[[Toronto]] area. Her father, Deepak Gandhi, a musician by hobby and an electronics engineer by profession, recognized her potential and encouraged her to sing. She first performed in 2005 at a gig at her father's show in Toronto at a Christmas event and the years to follow became prosperous for her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.bramptonguardian.com/community-story/4468868-bollywood-crooner-from-brampton-enroute-to-stardom|title=Bollywood crooner from Brampton enroute to stardom {{!}} BramptonGuardian.com|last=Panjwani|first=Radhika|date=2014-04-16|work=BramptonGuardian.com|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nJonita attended the University of Western Ontario where she completed her degrees in health science and business. During university, she worked an internship at CIBC World Markets, but continued to sing and perform throughout her education. She has had formal training in Western and Hindustani classical singing.<ref name=\"ndtv\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/music/jonita-gandhi-lucky-my-first-bollywood-song-for-shah-rukh-khan-starrer-389250|title=Jonita Gandhi: Lucky my first Bollywood song for Shah Rukh Khan-starrer|publisher=NDTV.com|date=8 July 2013|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"theh\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-voice-that-touched-big-bs-heart/article4018718.ece|title=A voice that touched Big B\u2019s heart|newspaper=The Hindu.com|date= 21 October 2012|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nJonita Gandhi's professional music career started with YouTube cover songs in collaboration with [[Aakash Gandhi]] when she was 17. The videos quickly went viral and led to a myriad of opportunities to perform. Her hits on YouTube began with covers of well-known Hindi-film songs, such as ''Someone Like You'', ''Pani Da Rang'', ''Tujhko Jo Paaya'', ''Tum Hi Ho'', ''Suhaani Raat'', ''Yeh Honsla'' and many others. Her beginning concerts typically consisted of these covers.<ref name=\"ndtv\"/>\n\nHer jump to playback singing began with an opportunity to perform alongside [[Sonu Nigam]]. This tour crossed various countries including [[Russia]], [[UK]], [[US]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Afterward, her sights were set on starting a career in the Bollywood music industry. On the heels of Sonu Nigam's world tour, Jonita stepped into the world of playback singing with a debut in [[Chennai Express]] starring [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Deepika Padukone]]. The music for this film was composed by [[Vishal\u2013Shekhar]] and her feature in the song was happen-stance; it was during a meeting with Vishal-Shekhar's mix engineer Abhishek Ghatak. She further solidified her place in [[Bollywood]] with the movie [[Highway (2014 Hindi film)|Highway]], singing both ''Kahaan Hoon Main'' and ''Implosive Silence''.<ref name=\"ibn\">{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/my-efforts-have-paid-off-with-highway-says-singer-jonita-gandhi/450139-8-66.html|title=My efforts have paid off with 'Highway', says singer Jonita Gandhi|date=5 February 2014|publisher=IBN Live.in.com|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nJonita's work as a playback singer has significantly expanded since and she has been nominated for several awards. Her relevance stems from positive association with multiple extremely successful music directors, ranging from [[A. R. Rahman]] to [[Pritam]] and more. Rahman featured Jonita in the concert film [[One Heart (film)]] and, like many other music directors, typically requests Jonita to perform with him at concerts; in example Jonita performed at the 2016 Jubilee Games in Dubai with [[Salim\u2013Sulaiman]] and [[Amit Trivedi]] on [[MTV Unplugged (India)|MTV Unplugged]].<ref name=\"news\" />\n\n[[The Breakup Song (Indian song)|The Breakup Song]] is her most successful song to-date and has brought her many award nominations and wider recognition.

In a running battle, the French covered the retreat of the convoy and attempted to escape by sailing in shallow waters close to the shore of Maguelone. After two of the ships of the line ran aground, their crew evacuated them and scuttled them by fire after removing valuable equipment, including the artillery. The remaining ship and frigates made good their escape to Toulon. A British cutting-out party attacked the convoy in Baie des Roses on 1 November, destroying most of it and capturing three ships.\n\n== Context ==\nOn 21 October 1809, a squadron of the French Navy under Rear-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin]] left Toulon, escorting a convoy bound for [[Barcelona]]. On 23, off [[Cape Saint Sebastian]], the squadron detected five sails in the West. With a light wind from the East, Baudin ordered the convoy to seek shelter in [[Baie des Roses]], and had his forces sail to the open sea. By noon, 14 British ships were in sight. In the night, the weather deteriorated and the ships had to reduce sail, an operation made difficult and longer than usual by the lack of training of the crew. In the morning of 24, the squadron found itself near the coast, and by 7:30, Baudin ordered his ships to anchor.

The book is an English translation by Catherine Porter of the French book, ''Politiques de la nature''. It is published by [[Harvard University Press]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn the book, Latour argues for a new and better take on political ecology (not the discipline but the ecological political movements, e.g. greens) that embraces his feeling that, \"political ecology has nothing to do with nature\". In fact, Latour argues that the idea of nature is unfair because it unfairly allows those engaged in political discourse to \"short-circuit\" discussions. Latour uses [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Allegory of the Cave|metaphor of \"the cave\"]] to describe the current role of nature and science in separating facts from values which is the role of politics and non-scientists. Building on the arguments levelled in his previous works, Latour argues that this distinction between facts and values is rarely useful and in many situations dangerous. He claims that it leads to a system that ignores nature's socially constructed status and creates a political order without \"due process of individual will\".\n\nInstead, he calls for a \"new Constitution\" where different individuals can assemble [[Democracy|democratically]] without the definitions of facts and values influenced by current attitudes towards nature and scientific knowledge. Latour describes an alternate set of rules by which this assembly, or collective as he calls it, might come together and be constituted. He also describes the way that entities will be allowed in or out in the future. In describing this collective, Latour draws attention to the role of the spokesperson, who must be doubted but who must speak for otherwise mute things in order to ensure that the collective involves both \"humans and non-humans\". This is also an important aspect of [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) that can be found in his main sociological works.\n\nThe book includes a short summary at the end and a glossary of terms.\n\n== Reviews of the book ==\n[[Sal Restivo]] emphasises that the book is reproducing the insights from [[Science Studies]], which [[Bruno Latour]] himself has greatly contributed to.

This word is ultimately borrowed from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u062a}} [[Qila|{{transl|fa|kalat}}]], \"fortress\". Other [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|sr|galac}}. However, the ''galat'' root appears in nearby toponyms, some of which show clearly a Cuman origin, for example '''G\u0103l\u0103\u021bui Lake''', which has the typical Cuman -''ui'' suffix for \"water\". Another toponym in the region is [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], with its town of [[Halych]], locally associated with the [[jackdaw]] (Kawka, Halka). Before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Rus]], Gala\u021bi was known as Malyi Halych (Little Halych) as part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]].<ref>Arkas, M.

For example, north west of the town of Gala\u021bi, on the eastern shores of the Malina marshes, fragments of ceramic-type Stoicani Aldeni, stilex and tools made of bone have been found. A stone sceptre, from the late Bronze Age, belonging to the Coslogeni culture was found on the marshes' southern bank. Gala\u021bi town itself developed from an ancient [[Dacia]]n settlement of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE where there was a ford across the [[Danube]] river. In 101 to 102 and 105 to 106, the [[Dacians]] fought wars against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and the area became part of the Roman empire. A [[Castra of Tirighina-B\u0103rbo\u0219i|strong Roman fortress]] was built at Barbo\u0219i to defend the ford across Danube. From the 300s a Daco-Roman settlement developed at a ford south of the site of the Church of the Virgin.\n\n===Medieval period===\nThere is evidence of continuous inhabitation of Gala\u021bi since the 600s. A treasure hoard consisting of 12 silver coins issued between 613 and 685 was found in a [[Byzantine]] tomb near the Church of the Virgin. Western and Byzantine coins from the time of Emperor Michael IV (1034\u20131041) were also found. At one time {{when|date=November 2013}}, the city became part of the [[Republic of Genoa|Republic of Genoa Territories]] and was called \"Caladda\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Repubblica_di_Genova.png|title=Map of Repubblica di Genova.|publisher=}}</ref> In 1445, a document signed by [[Stephen II of Moldavia]] mentions Gala\u021bi. In 1484, [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] was conquered by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Gala\u021bi township remained [[Moldavia|Moldova's]] only port, not only for domestic trade but also for trade with Turkey and Poland. In 1590, the Gala\u021bi Jewish cemetery was opened.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Erminy and von Saar - Moldau, Stadt Gallatz 2.jpg|thumb|Gala\u021bi in 1826]]\n\n====Burial of Hetman Mazeppa====\nThe Ukrainian folk hero, Ivan Stepanovich [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazeppa]] was a [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] who died on 1709 in [[Varni\u0163a, Anenii Noi|Varni\u0163a]], [[Bessarabia]], and was buried in Gala\u021bi.  Hetman Mazeppa was buried in a brick [[burial vault (tomb)|tomb]].\n\n====Battle of St\u0103nile\u0219ti====\nIn 1710, Tatars plundered Gala\u021bi after the [[Pruth River Campaign|Battle of St\u0103nile\u0219ti]].\n\n====Russo-Turkish war====\nIn 1775, Russia established a consulate in Gala\u021bi. However, in 1789, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u201392)|Russo-Turkish war]] of 1787\u201392, Gala\u021bi was burned by the armies of the Russian general [[Mikhail Kamensky]].\n\n===19th century===\nDue to unrest in this part of Europe, Gala\u021bi port became a site for the construction of large warships. Abbot Boskov, a Romanian traveller, stated:\n:\"I saw a large boat, the way those who say Turks caravels, which is on site, ready to be launched into the water. He was commissioned by Isaac-aga, big tax collector of Constantinople. The ship was huge, seventeen seventy steps, and loaded with eighty-four bronze cannons.\"\n\n====Massacre of 1821====\nIn the Greek\u2013Turkish war of 1821, Ottoman subjects were killed in Gala\u021bi (and in other towns). This was the result of a series of rebellions by members of the port workers' association and city clerks. {{clarify|date=April 2012}} {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n====Growth through trade====\nDespite the wars and unrest, Gala\u021bi developed based on trade (especially grain exports). In 1805, France and England established vice-consulates. In 1832, the School of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel is founded. Two years later, in 1834, Austrian ships were having scheduled arrivals and in 1837, Gala\u021bi was declared a free port (this was revoked in 1882). In 1850, [[James Buchanan]], the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Gala\u021bi and the U.S. opened a consulate in 1858. Gala\u021bi was also a trading port for German lands. When the [[Crimean War]] (1854\u20131856) finished, Gala\u021bi became a seat of the [[Commissions of the Danube River|Danube European Commission]]. In 1869, the Mihai Eminescu municipal park opened and by 1870, factories were opening. By, 1908 they numbered 41. On 13 September 1872, the King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened. The River station opened shortly after on 24 September 1880. In 1889, the V. A. Urechia library opened.\n\n====Growth through unity====\nAfter the [[United Principalities|union of the Romanian principalities]] in 1859, with [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as [[domnitor|leader]], development in Gala\u021bi increased. Zeletin wrote,\n:\"The birth of the modern Romanian state must distinguish two main currents \u2013 one exuberant but superficial, based on liberal ideas which depart from Paris to Bucharest and Ia\u0219i. The other is quieter but deep, leaving from London to Gala\u021bi and Br\u0103ila: English is the current capitalist economy.\" (''Romanian Bourgeoisie'', Zeletin, Stephen.) {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===1900\u20131947===\n[[File:Str. Domneasca.jpg|thumb|left|Domneasc\u0103 Street, 1905]]\nBetween 1900 and the beginning of [[World War I]], Gala\u021bi continued its trade in grain and timber with sixteen consulates. Gala\u021bi was part of [[Counties of Romania|Covurlui County]].\n\nIn 1907, social unrest among the peasant classes precipitated intervention by the Romanian army. In 1911, a statue of the poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] was erected.\n\n====World War I====\n{{main|Battle of Gala\u021bi}}\nGala\u021bi remained under Romanian control during [[Romania during World War I|World War I]]. Romanian soldiers fought alongside those of Russia against the army of the [[Central Powers]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Gala\u021bi was [[Battle of Gala\u021bi|bombed by retreating Russian troops]] in January 1918.<ref name=Stoica1>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=88|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/88/}}</ref>\n\n====Interwar period====\nIn 1919, a high school for Jewish students opened. A first air race between Gala\u021bi and Bucharest was held in 1926. The 1930 Romanian census recorded 100,000 residents in Gala\u021bi. After [[Bucharest]], [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], [[Ia\u0219i]] and [[Chernivtsi|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]], Gala\u021bi was Romania's fifth city. In 1938, the [[\u021ainutul Dun\u0103rii|\u021ainutul Dun\u0103rii de Jos]] (Lower Danube Land) was established.\n\n====World war II====\nDuring [[Romania in World War II|World War II]], Gala\u021bi was bombed by the [[Soviet Air Forces]] and [[Luftwaffe]]. The railway station, inaugurated on 13 September 1872, was destroyed as were many other historic buildings and most of the old town. On 27 August 1944, Gala\u021bi was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]].\n\n====Jewish community====\nBefore World War II Gala\u021bi hosted 22 synagogues and in 1926, it was the base for the Zionist Revisionist Organization of Romania. Although Gala\u021bi's Jewish community suffered persecution by the pro-Nazi authorities during World War II, the community was not destroyed in the Holocaust. Since the 1940s the community has gradually diminished through emigration.\n\n===Communist period (1947\u20131989)===\n\n====Post war rebuilding====\nAfter World War II, Gala\u021bi was rebuilt along communist lines. The town's population was about 80,000. In 1956, a proposal to join Br\u0103ila and Gala\u021bi was made and the building of a speed tram pier was proposed with a Swiss company. The plans never materialized. Construction of the [[Gala\u021bi steel works]] began in 1960 and the plant opened in 1966. The population at this time was 151,000. In 1971, the [[F\u0103urei]] \u2013 Gala\u021bi railway capacity was increased, and, in 1982, it was electrified.\n\n====Mogo\u0219oaia boating tragedy====\nOn September 11, 1989, a Bulgarian ship collided with a cruise ship near Gala\u021bi. 151 passengers and crew died  (all but sixteen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/croaziera-jurnalul/mogosoaia-mormantul-din-dunare-10068.htm|title=\"Mogosoaia\"  -  mormantul din Dunare|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-11/news/mn-1478_1_bulgarian-ship] \"Ships crash on Danube\" Associated Press. 11 September 1989.

The Siret river reached record levels and across Romania, the death toll reached 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adrc.asia/latestinfo/View_E.php?lang=en&KEY=852|title=ADRC DisasterReport|website=www.adrc.asia}}</ref> In 2010, broken flood barriers caused flooding of the Valley City area of Gala\u021bi.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:FerryDanubeGalati20060716.jpg|thumb|Over the Danube]]\n\n===Topography===\nGala\u021bi is located in southeastern Romania. Its coordinates are latitude 45 \u00b0 27 'north and longitude 28 \u00b0 02' east. Its area is {{convert|246.4|km2|sp=us}}. Gala\u021bi lies in the southern part of the [[Moldavian Plateau]] on the left (west) bank of the Danube river at the junction of the [[Siret River]] (west) and the [[Prut|Prut River]] (east), near Lake Brates. It is {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} from the [[Black Sea]]. The nearest town is [[Br\u0103ila]], {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} to the south. Gala\u021bi is built on three geological terraces. One lies beneath \"Valley City\", with elevations between {{convert|5|and|7|m}}. The other two, which make a fan shape, have elevations of {{convert|20|\u2013|25|m|sp=us}} (the site of the old town, now the city centre) and {{convert|40|m|sp=us}} (the site of the modern city) respectively.\nThe Danube river is considered the \"life-blood\" of Gala\u021bi. The Danube is the second longest river in Europe {{convert|2850|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=x}}), with an average flow of {{convert|6199|m3|cuft|sp=us}} per second in the Gala\u021bi section. After the Siret River, the largest tributary in Romania, joins the Danube, the flow is {{convert|210|m3/s|cuft/s|sp=us}}. After the Prut River joins the Danube, the flow becomes {{convert|86|m3/s|cuft/s|sp=us}}. The Danube river flows have significant seasonal variation. The maximum flows occur in May; {{convert|18000|\u2013|19000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The minimum flows occur during the summer; {{convert|2000|\u2013|2450|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on|disp=or}}.\n\n===Climate===\nGala\u021bi has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate

The site lies north of the Danube, near the mouth of the Siret. A comparison can be made to the fortress at [[Dinogetia]]. The archeologists found clear stratigraphy in the excavation. They located the Tirighina Dacian fortress, reinforced by an earthen bank. Finds included Dacian pottery from an import business. Also found was a silver coin dating the Dacian fortress to the first century BCE. A burning layer suggested damage to the fortress by fire.  Also found were coins dating from the rule of [[Augustus]](63 BCE \u2013 14 AD) through to [[Nero]] (37AD \u2013 68AD).\n\n====Lambrinidi House====\n[[File:GL-II-m-B-03014 Casa Lambrinidi.JPG|thumb|Lambrinidi House]]\nThis house is located near the university, at 51 Royal Street.

This word is ultimately borrowed from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u062a}} [[Qila|{{transl|fa|kalat}}]], \"fortress\". Other [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|sr|galac}}. However, the ''galat'' root appears in nearby toponyms, some of which show clearly a Cuman origin, for example '''G\u0103l\u0103\u021bui Lake''', which has the typical Cuman -''ui'' suffix for \"water\". Another toponym in the region is [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], with its town of [[Halych]], locally associated with the [[jackdaw]] (Kawka, Halka). Before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Rus]], Gala\u021bi was known as Malyi Halych (Little Halych) as part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]].<ref>Arkas, M.

For example, north west of the town of Gala\u021bi, on the eastern shores of the Malina marshes, fragments of ceramic-type Stoicani Aldeni, stilex and tools made of bone have been found. A stone sceptre, from the late Bronze Age, belonging to the Coslogeni culture was found on the marshes' southern bank. Gala\u021bi town itself developed from an ancient [[Dacia]]n settlement of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE where there was a ford across the [[Danube]] river. In 101 to 102 and 105 to 106, the [[Dacians]] fought wars against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and the area became part of the Roman empire. A [[Castra of Tirighina-B\u0103rbo\u0219i|strong Roman fortress]] was built at Barbo\u0219i to defend the ford across Danube. From the 300s a Daco-Roman settlement developed at a ford south of the site of the Church of the Virgin.\n\n===Medieval period===\nThere is evidence of continuous inhabitation of Gala\u021bi since the 600s. A treasure hoard consisting of 12 silver coins issued between 613 and 685 was found in a [[Byzantine]] tomb near the Church of the Virgin. Western and Byzantine coins from the time of Emperor Michael IV (1034\u20131041) were also found. At one time {{when|date=November 2013}}, the city became part of the [[Republic of Genoa|Republic of Genoa Territories]] and was called \"Caladda\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Repubblica_di_Genova.png|title=Map of Repubblica di Genova.|publisher=}}</ref> In 1445, a document signed by [[Stephen II of Moldavia]] mentions Gala\u021bi. In 1484, [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] was conquered by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Gala\u021bi township remained [[Moldavia|Moldova's]] only port, not only for domestic trade but also for trade with Turkey and Poland. In 1590, the Gala\u021bi Jewish cemetery was opened.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Erminy and von Saar - Moldau, Stadt Gallatz 2.jpg|thumb|Gala\u021bi in 1826]]\n\n====Burial of Hetman Mazeppa====\nThe Ukrainian folk hero, Ivan Stepanovich [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazeppa]] was a [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] who died on 1709 in [[Varni\u0163a, Anenii Noi|Varni\u0163a]], [[Bessarabia]], and was buried in Gala\u021bi.  Hetman Mazeppa was buried in a brick [[burial vault (tomb)|tomb]].\n\n====Battle of St\u0103nile\u0219ti====\nIn 1710, Tatars plundered Gala\u021bi after the [[Pruth River Campaign|Battle of St\u0103nile\u0219ti]].\n\n====Russo-Turkish war====\nIn 1775, Russia established a consulate in Gala\u021bi. However, in 1789, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u201392)|Russo-Turkish war]] of 1787\u201392, Gala\u021bi was burned by the armies of the Russian general [[Mikhail Kamensky]].\n\n===19th century===\nDue to unrest in this part of Europe, Gala\u021bi port became a site for the construction of large warships. Abbot Boskov, a Romanian traveller, stated:\n:\"I saw a large boat, the way those who say Turks caravels, which is on site, ready to be launched into the water. He was commissioned by Isaac-aga, big tax collector of Constantinople. The ship was huge, seventeen seventy steps, and loaded with eighty-four bronze cannons.\"\n\n====Massacre of 1821====\nIn the Greek\u2013Turkish war of 1821, Ottoman subjects were killed in Gala\u021bi (and in other towns). This was the result of a series of rebellions by members of the port workers' association and city clerks. {{clarify|date=April 2012}} {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n====Growth through trade====\nDespite the wars and unrest, Gala\u021bi developed based on trade (especially grain exports). In 1805, France and England established vice-consulates. In 1832, the School of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel is founded. Two years later, in 1834, Austrian ships were having scheduled arrivals and in 1837, Gala\u021bi was declared a free port (this was revoked in 1882). In 1850, [[James Buchanan]], the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Gala\u021bi and the U.S. opened a consulate in 1858. Gala\u021bi was also a trading port for German lands. When the [[Crimean War]] (1854\u20131856) finished, Gala\u021bi became a seat of the [[Commissions of the Danube River|Danube European Commission]]. In 1869, the Mihai Eminescu municipal park opened and by 1870, factories were opening. By, 1908 they numbered 41. On 13 September 1872, the King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened. The River station opened shortly after on 24 September 1880. In 1889, the V. A. Urechia library opened.\n\n====Growth through unity====\nAfter the [[United Principalities|union of the Romanian principalities]] in 1859, with [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as [[domnitor|leader]], development in Gala\u021bi increased. Zeletin wrote,\n:\"The birth of the modern Romanian state must distinguish two main currents \u2013 one exuberant but superficial, based on liberal ideas which depart from Paris to Bucharest and Ia\u0219i. The other is quieter but deep, leaving from London to Gala\u021bi and Br\u0103ila: English is the current capitalist economy.\" (''Romanian Bourgeoisie'', Zeletin, Stephen.) {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===1900\u20131947===\n[[File:Str. Domneasca.jpg|thumb|left|Domneasc\u0103 Street, 1905]]\nBetween 1900 and the beginning of [[World War I]], Gala\u021bi continued its trade in grain and timber with sixteen consulates. Gala\u021bi was part of [[Counties of Romania|Covurlui County]].\n\nIn 1907, social unrest among the peasant classes precipitated intervention by the Romanian army. In 1911, a statue of the poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] was erected.\n\n====World War I====\n{{main|Battle of Gala\u021bi}}\nGala\u021bi remained under Romanian control during [[Romania during World War I|World War I]].

A first air race between Gala\u021bi and Bucharest was held in 1926. The 1930 Romanian census recorded 100,000 residents in Gala\u021bi. After [[Bucharest]], [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], [[Ia\u0219i]] and [[Chernivtsi|Cern\u0103u\u021bi]], Gala\u021bi was Romania's fifth city. In 1938, the [[\u021ainutul Dun\u0103rii|\u021ainutul Dun\u0103rii de Jos]] (Lower Danube Land) was established.\n\n====World war II====\nDuring [[Romania in World War II|World War II]], Gala\u021bi was bombed by the [[Soviet Air Forces]] and [[Luftwaffe]]. The railway station, inaugurated on 13 September 1872, was destroyed as were many other historic buildings and most of the old town. On 27 August 1944, Gala\u021bi was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]].\n\n====Jewish community====\nBefore World War II Gala\u021bi hosted 22 synagogues and in 1926, it was the base for the Zionist Revisionist Organization of Romania. Although Gala\u021bi's Jewish community suffered persecution by the pro-Nazi authorities during World War II, the community was not destroyed in the Holocaust. Since the 1940s the community has gradually diminished through emigration.\n\n===Communist period (1947\u20131989)===\n\n====Post war rebuilding====\nAfter World War II, Gala\u021bi was rebuilt along communist lines. The town's population was about 80,000. In 1956, a proposal to join Br\u0103ila and Gala\u021bi was made and the building of a speed tram pier was proposed with a Swiss company. The plans never materialized. Construction of the [[Gala\u021bi steel works]] began in 1960 and the plant opened in 1966. The population at this time was 151,000. In 1971, the [[F\u0103urei]] \u2013 Gala\u021bi railway capacity was increased, and, in 1982, it was electrified.\n\n====Mogo\u0219oaia boating tragedy====\nOn September 11, 1989, a Bulgarian ship collided with a cruise ship near Gala\u021bi. 151 passengers and crew died  (all but sixteen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/croaziera-jurnalul/mogosoaia-mormantul-din-dunare-10068.htm|title=\"Mogosoaia\"  -  mormantul din Dunare|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-11/news/mn-1478_1_bulgarian-ship] \"Ships crash on Danube\" Associated Press. 11 September 1989.

Its coordinates are latitude 45 \u00b0 27 'north and longitude 28 \u00b0 02' east. Its area is {{convert|246.4|km2|sp=us}}. Gala\u021bi lies in the southern part of the [[Moldavian Plateau]] on the left (west) bank of the Danube river at the junction of the [[Siret River]] (west) and the [[Prut|Prut River]] (east), near Lake Brates. It is {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} from the [[Black Sea]]. The nearest town is [[Br\u0103ila]], {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} to the south. Gala\u021bi is built on three geological terraces. One lies beneath \"Valley City\", with elevations between {{convert|5|and|7|m}}. The other two, which make a fan shape, have elevations of {{convert|20|\u2013|25|m|sp=us}} (the site of the old town, now the city centre) and {{convert|40|m|sp=us}} (the site of the modern city) respectively.\nThe Danube river is considered the \"life-blood\" of Gala\u021bi.

The site lies north of the Danube, near the mouth of the Siret. A comparison can be made to the fortress at [[Dinogetia]]. The archeologists found clear stratigraphy in the excavation. They located the Tirighina Dacian fortress, reinforced by an earthen bank. Finds included Dacian pottery from an import business. Also found was a silver coin dating the Dacian fortress to the first century BCE. A burning layer suggested damage to the fortress by fire.  Also found were coins dating from the rule of [[Augustus]](63 BCE \u2013 14 AD) through to [[Nero]] (37AD \u2013 68AD).\n\n====Lambrinidi House====\n[[File:GL-II-m-B-03014 Casa Lambrinidi.JPG|thumb|Lambrinidi House]]\nThis house is located near the university, at 51 Royal Street. It was built by Lambrinidi Epaminonda, a Greek mill owner. He owned a machine shop to repair ships. The Prince Charles stayed at the house on a visit to Gala\u021bi, in April 1879. It has served as the seat of the Court of Appeals; the Mihail Kogalniceanu High School and, after the earthquake of November 9, 1940, the city hall.\n\n====Robescu House====\nRobescu House was built about 1896. The architect was [[Ion Mincu]]. A Romanian tourist website describes the building: :\"Robescu House has an elevated basement, two levels with two turret-balcony on the first floor and another balcony at the ground floor, to the street. The exterior decorations are made in Brancoveanu style, glossy ceramic plates. The glossy ceramic is used to decorate the floral upper register.\nToday it serves as the \"Children's Palace\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romguide.net/Visit/Robescu-House_vt12e|title=Robescu House, Galati, Romguide tourism Romania|website=www.romguide.net|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235243/http://www.romguide.net/Visit/Robescu-House_vt12e|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Palace of Navigation (River Station)====\nThis building was designed by [[Petre Antonescu]].

It is the office of \"Maritime Danube Ports Administration\" and Navrom, which controls Romania's navigable waterways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navrom.ro/|title=NAVROM - Compania de navigatie fluviala romana|first=|last=pocan_marian@yahoo.com|website=www.navrom.ro}}</ref>\n[[File:Palatul Administrativ Galati.JPG|thumb|left|Administrative Palace]]\n\n====University Palace====\nThis former \"Palace of Justice\" is a prominent architectural monument in the Gala\u021bi old town. It was built between 1911 and 1913. Now, it is the university headquarters.\n\n====Lupa Capitolina====\nMeaning \"Capitoline Wolf\", this statue was erected in 1995 and reflects Roman influence in Gala\u021bi.\n\n====Administrative Palace====\nThis building was erected in 1904 and 1905 and opened on 27 April 1906. Like Robescu House, it was designed by Ion Mincu. Frederick Storck contributed white marble sculptures of \"industry\" and \"agriculture\" at the top of the main fa\u00e7ade.  Other features are two bronze flags and a large clock which plays the waltz, \"Danube Waves\" by Joseph Ivanovich (1845\u20131902).\n\n===Places of worship===\n[[File:Galati cathedral.jpg|thumb|St. Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral]]\n\n====Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Lower Danube \u2013 St. Andrew====\nThe cornerstone of the cathedral of the archbishop of Gala\u021bi was placed on 27 April 1906 by Prince Ferdinand and Queen Mary. Also present was the Bishop of the Lower Danube, Pimen Georgescu. Construction continued from 1906 to 1917. The architects were Petre Antonescu and Stephen Burcu\u0219. The church has one dome and no side isles. From 1989, restoration work has been underway at the church. This includes cleaning of the 1957 paint work, paving around the cathedral and the construction of the St John Cassian centre, a building for cultural, pastoral and missionary work. At the church's centennial in 2006, the relics of [[Nectarios of Aegina|St. Nectarios of Aegina]] were brought to Gala\u021bi.\n\n====Fortified Monastery of the Holy Virgin====\n[[File:Biserica Fortificata Precista Galati.jpg|thumb|left|Precista fortified church]]\nThis is the oldest building in Gala\u021bi. It was consecrated as a place of worship in September 1647 during the reign of [[Vasile Lupu]]. The church was dedicated to the [[Vatopedi Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]. It was built from local materials including stone, forest wood, brick and lime, sand from the beaches of the Danube and so on. As well as its typical Romanian church architecture, the monastery has some specific elements of interest such as a bell tower with battlements for observation of the Danube valley and for defense. The tower has two levels and a room to hide assets. There are two ramparts and a door to a balcony. The second floor is fitted with windows and battlements. Another of the church's defences is a reinforced bridge consisting of two parts, one above the nave and one above the altar. The bridge has 28 battlements. The church survived the turbulent periods of Gala\u021bi's history and was rebuilt and restored in 1829 and again in 1859. From 1953 to 1957, the church was used as a museum. It was restored in the period 1991\u20131994. There may be a tunnel from the church beneath the Danube.\n\n====Bulgarian Church====\n[[File:Bulgarian church Galati.jpg|thumbnail|The Bulgarian Church in Gala\u021bi]]\nConstruction of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church of [[Saint Pantaleon]] began in 1861 under the guidance of [[Bulgarian National Revival]] figure Archimandrite [[Maxim Raykovich]] (1801\u20131874) of [[Dryanovo]]. However, the lack of funds prolonged the construction works and the church was only consecrated in 1887. The Bulgarian Church of Saint Pantaleon features a [[Neo-Byzantine]] design with Slavic influences.<ref name=\"cilinca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.viata-libera.ro/vlg-cultura/68475-comori-de-patrimoniu-biserica-sf-pantelimon-,-o-atlantida-bulgareasca-pe-o-insula-a-libertatii|title=\"Comori de patrimoniu\": Biserica \"Sf.

The same house would become a hub for Bulgarian revolutionaries persecuted by the Ottoman authorities. In 1871\u201372, Bulgaria's national poet [[Hristo Botev]] lived in the house during a part of his exile, as a commemorative plaque still reminds.<ref name=\"cilinca\"/>\n\nRaykovich died in Gala\u021bi in 1874 and was buried in the courtyard of the Bulgarian Church, where his tombstone still stands.<ref name=\"cilinca\"/>\n\n====Greek Church====\nThe cornerstone of the Greek Church was laid on 6 August 1866. The church was dedicated to the \"Transfiguration\" on 17 September 1872 by the Bishop [[Melchisedec \u0218tef\u0103nescu|Melchizedek]] and the [[Archimandrite]] Eughenie Xiropotamo. In the nave is a marble plaque with the names of the founders and two marble plates with the names of the founders and major benefactors.

(In 1803, teaching was conducted in Romanian under the orders of Constantin Moruz). During the Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774), and the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War (1787\u20131792), Mavromol church was damaged and teaching ceased until 1803.\nThe church is constructed in the style of a [[basilica]] with [[apse]]s beyond the main walls. The church has a carved wooden icon of the \"Virgin Mary\" from the church of [[Saint Sava National College|St. Sava Monastery]] in Bucharest. The ceiling is composed of three parts separated by double arches. The entrance is on the south side through a door marked by an icon and heraldic symbols: a bull's head and two lions.

As an area and kin group it is mentioned in 1403 and then in 1416 in Venetian archives. Kastrati is a community based on kinship and territorial ties that are traced back to the common ancestor of most of its brotherhoods (''vllazni''), Detal Bratoshi.\n\n== Geography ==\nKastrati is located in northwestern Albania, [[Shkod\u00ebr County]] near the Albania-Montenegro border. The region is wholly included in the [[Kastrat (municipality)|Kastrat]] municipal unit about 26km to the east. In terms of historical divisions, it borders [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the north, the town of [[Koplik]] to the south, [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] and Boga to the northeast and [[Shkreli (tribe)|Shkreli]] to the east. Kastrati borders the [[Skadar Lake]] to the west. This part of the lake that is traditionally used by Kastrati is called ''Viri''. \n\nKastrati is divided into two sub-regions: the mountainous ''[[Kastrat (settlement)|Katund i Kastratit]]'' and the lowland [[Bajz\u00eb]] area. The settlement of Bajz\u00eb itself is the center of Kastrati. This division reflects the organization of Kastrati's economy, which is a combination of agricultural and livestock activities. All families of Kastrati have property in both areas. Bajz\u00eb includes: Aliaj, [[Jeran]], [[Gradec, Shkod\u00ebr|Gradec]], [[Vukpalaj]], [[Ivanaj]], [[Pjetroshan]] and ''Katund i Kastratit'' includes: [[Goraj, Albania|Goraj]], Budish\u00eb and [[Bratosh]].<ref name=\"Shkurtaj\">{{cite book |last1=Shkurtaj |first1=Gjovalin |title=E folmja e Kastratit |date=2013 |pages=3-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJISAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=5 March 2020 |ref=Shkurtaj}}</ref>\n\nIn the Ottoman period, some villages like [[Kamic\u00eb-Flak\u00eb]] were put under the [[bajrak]] (military adminstrative unit) of Kastrati, but are not part of this region. They are related to the wider [[Vraka]] area in terms of cultural ties. <ref name=\"Steinke9\">{{cite book|last=Steinke|first=Klaus|last2=Ylli|first2=Xhelal|title=Die slavischen Minderheiten in Albanien (SMA). 4.

In the beginning of the 20th century, archival records yielded more historically grounded observations. Almost all of Kastrati's brotherhoods descend from the figure of ''Detal Bratoshi'', thus have no endogamous relations within Kastrati. The name ''Kastrati'' itself is the name of a settlement and small tribe that lived in that exact area before the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century.\n\nKastrati is first mentioned in 1403 when its leader ''Alexius'', head of three villages appears to be awarded gifts by the Venetian governor of Scutari.<ref name=\"Durham1928\">{{cite book|author=Mary Edith Durham|title=Some clannish origins, laws and customs of the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSSBAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 May 2013|year=1928|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|page=22|quote=The Kastrati were evidently a powerful clan, for in 1403 we find Alexius Kastrati headman in a list of Albanian chiefs who are rewarded by the Venetians with gifts of cloth.}}</ref><ref name=\"umetnosti1983\">{{cite book|author=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti|title=Glas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq0rAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=1983|page=109|quote=\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043a\u043e\u043c XV \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u0441\u0440\u0435\u045b\u0443 \u0441\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0448\u045a\u0435\u0433 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0438 \u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0446 \u0431\u0438\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0441\u0442\u043e. \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 1403... }}</ref> Alexius Kastrati reappears as head of Kastrati in the Venetian cadastre of Scutari in 1416-7.

As an area and kin group it is mentioned in 1403 and then in 1416 in Venetian archives. Kastrati is a community based on kinship and territorial ties that are traced back to the common ancestor of most of its brotherhoods (''vllazni''), Detal Bratoshi.\n\n== Geography ==\nKastrati is located in northwestern Albania, [[Shkod\u00ebr County]] near the Albania-Montenegro border. The region is wholly included in the [[Kastrat (municipality)|Kastrat]] municipal unit about 26km to the east. In terms of historical divisions, it borders [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the north, the town of [[Koplik]] to the south, [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] and Boga to the northeast and [[Shkreli (tribe)|Shkreli]] to the east. Kastrati borders the [[Skadar Lake]] to the west. This part of the lake that is traditionally used by Kastrati is called ''Viri''. \n\nKastrati is divided into two sub-regions: the mountainous ''[[Kastrat (settlement)|Katund i Kastratit]]'' and the lowland [[Bajz\u00eb]] area. The settlement of Bajz\u00eb itself is the center of Kastrati. This division reflects the organization of Kastrati's economy, which is a combination of agricultural and livestock activities. All families of Kastrati have property in both areas. Bajz\u00eb includes: Aliaj, [[Jeran]], [[Gradec]], [[Vukpalaj]], [[Ivanaj]], [[Pjetroshan]] and ''Katund i Kastratit'' includes: [[Goraj]], Budish\u00eb and [[Bratosh]].<ref name=\"Shkurtaj\">{{cite book |last1=Shkurtaj |first1=Gjovalin |title=E folmja e Kastratit |date=2013 |pages=3-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJISAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=5 March 2020 |ref=Shkurtaj}}</ref>\n\nIn the Ottoman period, some villages like [[Kamic\u00eb-Flak\u00eb]] were put under the [[bajrak]] (military adminstrative unit) of Kastrati, but are not part of this region. They are related to the wider [[Vraka]] area in terms of cultural ties. <ref name=\"Steinke9\">{{cite book|last=Steinke|first=Klaus|last2=Ylli|first2=Xhelal|title=Die slavischen Minderheiten in Albanien (SMA). 4.

In the beginning of the 20th century, archival records yielded more historically grounded observations. Almost all of Kastrati's brotherhoods descend from the figure of ''Detal Bratoshi'', thus have no endogamous relations within Kastrati.
