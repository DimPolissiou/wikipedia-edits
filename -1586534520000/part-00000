Several variants of the car appeared during the next year or two, all conforming to the same basic design and earning for themselves a reputation second to none for fast and reliable travel. The 60-h.p. cars were announced late in 1902. The cars were possessed of a very real performance superior to anything else which could be bought at the time... and the model achieved an almost invincible position among the fast cars of its day.}}</ref><ref>\"The 60 h.p.

The E-type was produced for 14 years and was initially powered by a six-cylinder engine, followed by a V12 engine for the final generation.\n\nIn 1962, the [[MG MGB|MG B]] introduced a new era of affordable lightweight four-cylinder roadsters. The MG B used a [[unibody]] construction and was produced until 1980. Other successful lightweight roadsters include the [[Triumph Spitfire]] (1962-1980) and the [[Alfa Romeo Spider]] (1966-1993). The [[Fiat X1/9]] (1972-1989) was unusual for its use of a [[mid-engine design]] in an affordable roadster model. A late entrant to the affordable roadster market was the 1975 [[Triumph TR7]], however by the late 1970s the demand for this style of car was in decline, resulting in production ceasing in 1982.\n\nThe original [[Lotus Elan]] (1962-1975) two-seat coupe and roadster models are an early commercial success for the philosophy of achieving performance through minimising weight, as has been rated as one of the top 10 sports cars of the 1960s. The Elan featured fibreglass bodies, a backbone chassis, and overhead camshaft engines.\n\nA very different style of roadster was the [[AC Cobra]], released in 1962, which was fitted with V8 engines up to {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} in size.\n\nThe [[Porsche 911]] was released in 1964 and has remained in production since. The 911 is notable for its use of the uncommon [[rear-engine design]] and the use of a [[Flat-six_engine#Automotive_use|flat-six engine]]. Another successful rear-engine sports car was the original [[Alpine A110]] (1961-1977), which was a successful rally car during the [[Group_4_(racing)#Rallying|Group 4]] era.\n\nIn 1965, the [[BMW_New_Class#New_Class_Coup\u00e9s|BMW New Class Coupes]] were released, leading to the [[BMW 6 Series]] which remains in production to this day.\n\nThe [[Lamborghini Miura]] (1966) and [[Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale]] (1967) mid-engined high performance cars are often cited as the first [[supercar]]s.<ref name=\"simonscars.co.uk\">{{cite web |title=Supercars |url=http://www.simoncars.co.uk/racing/supercar.html |website=www.simoncars.co.uk |accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Love for the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a4346/petrolicious-alfa-romeo-tipo-33-stradale/ |website=www.roadandtrack.com |accessdate=4 May 2019 |date=25 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale: Is this the Most Beautiful Supercar Ever? |url=https://www.thesupercarblog.com/alfa-romeo-tipo-33-stradale-most-beautiful-supercar-ever/ |website=www.thesupercarblog.com |accessdate=4 May 2019 |language=en |date=30 May 2018}}</ref> Other significant European models of the 1960s and 1970s which might be considered supercars today are the [[Ferrari 250 GTO]] (1962-1964), [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso]] (1963-1964), [[Ferrari_275#275_GTB/4|Ferrari 275 GTB/4]] (1966-1968), [[Maserati_Ghibli#Ghibli_(AM115)|Maserati Ghibli]] (1967-1973), [[Ferrari Daytona]] (1968-1973), [[Dino 206 GT and 246 GT|Dino 246]] (1969-1974), [[De Tomaso Pantera]] (1971-1993), [[Ferrari_308_GTB/GTS#308_GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTB]] (1975-1980) and [[BMW M1]] (1978-1981).\n\nIn 1966, the [[Jensen FF]] became the first sports car to use [[all-wheel drive]].\n\nThe [[Ford Capri]] is a 2+2 coupe that was produced from 1968-1986 and intended to be a smaller European equivalent of the Ford Mustang. A main rival to the Capri was [[Opel Manta]], which was produced from 1970\u20131988.\n\nThe 1973-1978 [[Lancia Stratos]] was a mid-engined two-seat coupe that was powered by a Ferrari V6 engine. This was an unusual arrangement for a car used to compete in rallying, nonetheless it was very successful and won the World Rally Championship in [[1974 World Rally Championship|1974]], [[1975 World Rally Championship|1975]] and [[1976 World Rally Championship|1976]].\n\nThe [[Lancia Montecarlo]] was produced from 1975 to 1981 and is a mid-engine two-seater, available as a coup\u00e9 or a targa-top. Sold as Lancia Scorpion in the USA. Its racing variant, Montecarlo Turbo, won the [[1979 World Sportscar Championship season|1979 World Championship for Makes]] in its division and overall for [[1980 World Championship for Makes]] and [[1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes]]. Montecarlo also won the 1980 [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] and [[Giro d'Italia automobilistico]] marathon.

These cars included the 1986-1993 [[Porsche 959]], 1991-1995 [[Bugatti EB 110]], 1992-1994 [[Jaguar XJ220]] and 1993-1998 [[McLaren F1]].\n\nThe 1980-1995 [[Audi Quattro]] was a pioneering [[all-wheel drive]] sports car. The 1995 [[Porsche_993#Turbo|Porsche 911 Turbo (993)]] say the 911 Turbo model switch to all-wheel drive, a drivetrain layout that the model uses to this day.\n\nThe [[BMW M3]] was released in 1986 and has been produced for every generation since. The 1993-1996 [[Mercedes-Benz W124]] E36 AMG was the mass-produced AMG model.<ref>{{cite web |title=AMG The Story |url=https://www.mercedes-amg.com/en/driving-performance/history.html |website=www.mercedes-amg.com |accessdate=8 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Audi's equivalent division, called \"RS\", was launched in 1994 with the [[Audi RS 2 Avant]].\n\n[[Ford Europe]] withdrew from the sports car market at the end of 1986 when the Capri was discontinued after a production run of nearly two decades. There was no direct successor, as Ford was concentrating on higher performance versions of its hatchback and saloon models at the time.\n\nIn 1989, a new generation of [[Lotus_Elan#Elan_M100|Lotus Elan]] roadster was released which used a [[front-wheel drive]] layout, a controversial choice for a \"purist\" sports car. The Elan sold poorly and is was discontinued after three years. The 1996 [[Lotus Elise]], a [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid-engined, rear-wheel drive]] roadster, was much more successful and remains in production to this day.\n\n[[Roadster (automobile)|Roadsters]] enjoyed a resurgence in the mid 1990s, including the 1989-present [[Mazda MX-5]], the 1995-2002 [[BMW Z3]] (succeeded by the 2002-2016 BMW Z4), the 1995-2002 [[MG F]], the 1996-present [[Porsche Boxster]]  and the 1998-present [[Audi TT]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:Ferrari F40 (7434297012).jpg |[[Ferrari F40]] <br/> (1987-1992)\nFile:Lotus Elise front 20090806.jpg |[[Lotus_Elise#Series_1|Lotus Elise (Series 1)]] <br/> (1996-2001)\nFile:2005 Audi TT Quattro 3.2 Front.jpg |[[Audi_TT#TT_Mk1_(Type_8N,_1998\u20132006)|Audi TT (Mk1)]] <br/> (1998-2006)\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2000-present: Turbos become dominant, hybrids emerge ===\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Lotus Exige - 001.jpg\n| caption1          = [[Lotus Exige]] Series 2 (2004-2012)\n| image2            = 2017 Ferrari 488 GTB Automatic 3.9.jpg\n| caption2          = [[Ferrari 488]] (2015-2019)\n| image3            = 2016 BMW i8.jpg\n| caption3          = [[BMW i8]] (2014-present)\n}}\n\nThe 2000-present [[Lotus Exige]] was introduced as a coupe version of Elise. Similarly, [[Porsche_987#Cayman|Porsche Cayman (987)]] was introduced in 2006 as the coupe equivalent to the Porsche Boxster roadster. Lotus also expanded their model range with the 2009-present [[Lotus Evora]], a larger four-seat coupe.\n\nAudi's first mid-engined supercar is the 2006-present [[Audi R8]]. Other sports cars of the 2000s were the 2005-2010 [[Alfa Romeo Brera and Spider|Alfa Romeo Brera/Spider]], 2009-2015 [[Peugeot RCZ]] and the 2008-2017 reintroduction of the [[Volkswagen_Scirocco#Third_generation_(2008\u20132017)|Volkswagen Scirocco]] (a coupe based on the VW Golf platform).\n\nReflecting overall car industry trends, the mid 2010s saw [[naturally aspirated engine]]s being replaced by [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines. Ferrari's first regular production turbocharged engine was used in the 2014-2017 [[Ferrari_California#Ferrari_California_T_(2014\u20132017)|Ferrari California T]], followed by the 2015-2019 [[Ferrari 488]]. Similarly, in 2016, the [[Porsche_991#Second_phase_(2016\u2013present)_(991.2)|Porsche 911 (991.2)]] began to use turbocharging on all models and the [[Porsche 982]] Cayman/Boxster downsized from a six-cylinder engine to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nAlso in the 2010s, [[dual-clutch transmission]]s became more widespread, causing manual transmissions to decline in sales and no longer be offered on some models.\n\n[[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid-electric]] sports cars began to appear in the 2010s\u2014 notably the 2013-2016 [[LaFerrari]], 2013-2015 [[McLaren P1]], 2013-2015 [[Porsche 918 Spyder]] \"hypercars\". The 2014-present [[BMW i8]] was also an early plug-in hybrid sports car.\n\nMcLaren began permanent car manufacturing operations with the 2011-2014 [[McLaren 12C]].\n\nIn 2013, the [[Jaguar F-Type]] saw the brand return to two-seat sports car market, with the four-seat grand tourer Jaguar XK discontinued the following year.\n\nThe [[BMW 2 Series (F22)|BMW 2 Series]] coupe and convertible were introduced in 2013 to sit below the larger [[BMW 4 Series]] models, with the new [[BMW M2]] high-performance model introduced in 2015.\n\nThe 2013-present [[Alfa Romeo 4C]] two-seat coupe and roadster used a carbon-fibre body and became Alfa's mid-engine sports car since the 1967-1969 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale.\n\nFiat had exited the roadster market with the end of [[Fiat Barchetta]] production in 2005. The company resumed production of roadsters in 2016 with the [[Fiat 124 Spider (2016)|Fiat 124 Spider]], which is based on the Mazda MX-5.\n\nIn 2017, Renault revived the Alpine brand for the 2017-present [[Alpine A110 (2017)|Alpine A110]] mid-engine coupe.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:Porsche 918 Spyder IAA 2013 (Zuschnitt).jpg |[[Porsche 918 Spyder]] <br/> (2013-2015)\nFile:Festival automobile international 2014 - Alfa Romeo 4C - 009.jpg |[[Alfa Romeo 4C]] <br/> (2013-2018)\nFile:Fiat 124 Spider 1368cc registered September 2016.jpg |[[Fiat 124 Spider (2016)|Fiat 124 Spider]] <br/> (2016-present)\n</gallery>\n\n== United States ==\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = 2014 Chevy Corvette Stingray in yellow at LA Auto Show.jpg\n| caption1          = [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)]] (2013-2019)\n}}\n\nDuring the 1910s and 1920s, American manufacturers of smaller sports cars included [[Apperson]], [[Kissel Motor Car Company|Kissel]], Marion, Midland, National, [[Overland Automobile|Overland]], [[Stoddard-Dayton]] and Thomas; manufacturers of larger sports cars included Chadwick, [[Mercer (car)|Mercer]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1912-mercer-raceabout/|title=1912 Mercer Raceabout|website=revsinstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702090650/https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1912-mercer-raceabout/|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Stutz Motor Company]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3517/Stutz-Bearcat.html|title=1914 - 1917 Stutz Bearcat - Images, Specifications and Information|work=Ultimatecarpage.com|access-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324072558/http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3517/Stutz-Bearcat.html|archivedate=24 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> and [[Crane-Simplex|Simplex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1914-simplex/|title=1914 Simplex |website=www.revsinstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702044906/https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1914-simplex/|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Georgano\"/>\n\nSince the 1960s, American performance cars have often been designed as [[muscle car]]s rather than sports cars.

Other 2+2 models included the 1982-1989 [[Mitsubishi Starion]] (turbocharged and rear-wheel drive) and the 1985-1991 [[Subaru XT]] (available with a turbocharger and all-wheel drive). Subaru have produced few sports cars in their history, instead focussing on rally-influenced sedans/hatchbacks for their performance models, such as the Liberty RS and Imprezza WRX/STi models.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Toyota MR2]] two-seat coupe became Japan's first production [[mid-engine]] car. The MR2 switched to a two-seat roadster body style for the final generation from 1999\u20132007.\n\nThe first Korean coupe model was the 1988 [[Hyundai Scoupe]], which used front-wheel drive and was based on Excel hatchback.

Many of its features, such as a honeycomb radiator and gate gear change, were continued on the much improved version which Paul Daimler designed in 1899-1900. This was of course the famous Mercedes. It also laid down standards of chassis design which were to be followed, almost unthinkingly, for the next thirty years. Several variants of the car appeared during the next year or two, all conforming to the same basic design and earning for themselves a reputation second to none for fast and reliable travel.

The E-type was produced for 14 years and was initially powered by a six-cylinder engine, followed by a V12 engine for the final generation.\n\nIn 1962, the [[MG MGB|MG B]] introduced a new era of affordable lightweight four-cylinder roadsters. The MG B used a [[unibody]] construction and was produced until 1980. Other successful lightweight roadsters include the [[Triumph Spitfire]] (1962-1980) and the [[Alfa Romeo Spider]] (1966-1993). The [[Fiat X1/9]] (1972-1989) was unusual for its use of a [[mid-engine design]] in an affordable roadster model. A late entrant to the affordable roadster market was the 1975 [[Triumph TR7]], however by the late 1970s the demand for this style of car was in decline, resulting in production ceasing in 1982.\n\nThe original [[Lotus Elan]] (1962-1975) two-seat coupe and roadster models are an early commercial success for the philosophy of achieving performance through minimising weight, as has been rated as one of the top 10 sports cars of the 1960s. The Elan featured fibreglass bodies, a backbone chassis, and overhead camshaft engines.\n\nA very different style of roadster was the [[AC Cobra]], released in 1962, which was fitted with V8 engines up to {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} in size.\n\nThe [[Porsche 911]] was released in 1964 and has remained in production since. The 911 is notable for its use of the uncommon [[rear-engine design]] and the use of a [[Flat-six_engine#Automotive_use|flat-six engine]]. Another successful rear-engine sports car was the original [[Alpine A110]] (1961-1977), which was a successful rally car during the [[Group_4_(racing)#Rallying|Group 4]] era.\n\nIn 1965, the [[BMW_New_Class#New_Class_Coup\u00e9s|BMW New Class Coupes]] were released, leading to the [[BMW 6 Series]] which remains in production to this day.\n\nThe [[Lamborghini Miura]] (1966) and [[Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale]] (1967) mid-engined high performance cars are often cited as the first [[supercar]]s.<ref name=\"simonscars.co.uk\">{{cite web |title=Supercars |url=http://www.simoncars.co.uk/racing/supercar.html |website=www.simoncars.co.uk |accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Love for the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a4346/petrolicious-alfa-romeo-tipo-33-stradale/ |website=www.roadandtrack.com |accessdate=4 May 2019 |date=25 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 Stradale: Is this the Most Beautiful Supercar Ever? |url=https://www.thesupercarblog.com/alfa-romeo-tipo-33-stradale-most-beautiful-supercar-ever/ |website=www.thesupercarblog.com |accessdate=4 May 2019 |language=en |date=30 May 2018}}</ref> Other significant European models of the 1960s and 1970s which might be considered supercars today are the [[Ferrari 250 GTO]] (1962-1964), [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso]] (1963-1964), [[Ferrari_275#275_GTB/4|Ferrari 275 GTB/4]] (1966-1968), [[Maserati_Ghibli#Ghibli_(AM115)|Maserati Ghibli]] (1967-1973), [[Ferrari Daytona]] (1968-1973), [[Dino 206 GT and 246 GT|Dino 246]] (1969-1974), [[De Tomaso Pantera]] (1971-1993), [[Ferrari_308_GTB/GTS#308_GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTB]] (1975-1980) and [[BMW M1]] (1978-1981).\n\nIn 1966, the [[Jensen FF]] became the first sports car to use [[all-wheel drive]].\n\nThe [[Ford Capri]] is a 2+2 coupe that was produced from 1968-1986 and intended to be a smaller European equivalent of the Ford Mustang. A main rival to the Capri was [[Opel Manta]], which was produced from 1970-1988.\n\nThe 1973-1978 [[Lancia Stratos]] was a mid-engined two-seat coupe that was powered by a Ferrari V6 engine. This was an unusual arrangement for a car used to compete in rallying, nonetheless it was very successful and won the World Rally Championship in [[1974 World Rally Championship|1974]], [[1975 World Rally Championship|1975]] and [[1976 World Rally Championship|1976]].\n\nThe [[Lancia Montecarlo]] was produced from 1975 to 1981 and is a mid-engine two-seater, available as a coup\u00e9 or a targa-top. Sold as Lancia Scorpion in the USA. Its racing variant, Montecarlo Turbo, won the [[1979 World Sportscar Championship season|1979 World Championship for Makes]] in its division and overall for [[1980 World Championship for Makes]] and [[1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes]]. Montecarlo also won the 1980 [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] and [[Giro d'Italia automobilistico]] marathon.

There was no direct successor, as Ford was concentrating on higher performance versions of its hatchback and saloon models at the time.\n\nIn 1989, a new generation of [[Lotus_Elan#Elan_M100|Lotus Elan]] roadster was released which used a [[front-wheel drive]] layout, a controversial choice for a \"purist\" sports car.

The 1996 [[Lotus Elise]], a [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid-engined, rear-wheel drive]] roadster, was much more successful and remains in production to this day.\n\n[[Roadster (automobile)|Roadsters]] enjoyed a resurgence in the mid 1990s, including the 1989-present [[Mazda MX-5]], the 1995-2002 [[BMW Z3]] (succeeded by the 2002-2016 BMW Z4), the 1995-2002 [[MG F]], the 1996-present [[Porsche Boxster]]  and the 1998-present [[Audi TT]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:Ferrari F40 (7434297012).jpg |[[Ferrari F40]] <br/> (1987-1992)\nFile:Lotus Elise front 20090806.jpg |[[Lotus_Elise#Series_1|Lotus Elise (Series 1)]] <br/> (1996-2001)\nFile:2005 Audi TT Quattro 3.2 Front.jpg |[[Audi_TT#TT_Mk1_(Type_8N,_1998\u20132006)|Audi TT (Mk1)]] <br/> (1998-2006)\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2000-present: Turbos become dominant, hybrids emerge ===\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Lotus Exige - 001.jpg\n| caption1          = [[Lotus Exige]] Series 2 (2004-2012)\n| image2            = 2017 Ferrari 488 GTB Automatic 3.9.jpg\n| caption2          = [[Ferrari 488]] (2015-2019)\n| image3            = 2016 BMW i8.jpg\n| caption3          = [[BMW i8]] (2014-present)\n}}\n\nThe 2000-present [[Lotus Exige]] was introduced as a coupe version of Elise. Similarly, [[Porsche_987#Cayman|Porsche Cayman (987)]] was introduced in 2006 as the coupe equivalent to the Porsche Boxster roadster. Lotus also expanded their model range with the 2009-present [[Lotus Evora]], a larger four-seat coupe.\n\nAudi's first mid-engined supercar is the 2006-present [[Audi R8]]. Other sports cars of the 2000s were the 2005-2010 [[Alfa Romeo Brera and Spider|Alfa Romeo Brera/Spider]], 2009-2015 [[Peugeot RCZ]] and the 2008-2017 reintroduction of the [[Volkswagen_Scirocco#Third_generation_(2008\u20132017)|Volkswagen Scirocco]] (a coupe based on the VW Golf platform).\n\nReflecting overall car industry trends, the mid 2010s saw [[naturally aspirated engine]]s being replaced by [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines. Ferrari's first regular production turbocharged engine was used in the 2014-2017 [[Ferrari_California#Ferrari_California_T_(2014\u20132017)|Ferrari California T]], followed by the 2015-2019 [[Ferrari 488]]. Similarly, in 2016, the [[Porsche_991#Second_phase_(2016\u2013present)_(991.2)|Porsche 911 (991.2)]] began to use turbocharging on all models and the [[Porsche 982]] Cayman/Boxster downsized from a six-cylinder engine to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nAlso in the 2010s, [[dual-clutch transmission]]s became more widespread, causing manual transmissions to decline in sales and no longer be offered on some models.\n\n[[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid-electric]] sports cars began to appear in the 2010s\u2014 notably the 2013-2016 [[LaFerrari]], 2013-2015 [[McLaren P1]], 2013-2015 [[Porsche 918 Spyder]] \"hypercars\". The 2014-present [[BMW i8]] was also an early plug-in hybrid sports car.\n\nMcLaren began permanent car manufacturing operations with the 2011-2014 [[McLaren 12C]].\n\nIn 2013, the [[Jaguar F-Type]] saw the brand return to two-seat sports car market, with the four-seat grand tourer Jaguar XK discontinued the following year.\n\nThe [[BMW 2 Series (F22)|BMW 2 Series]] coupe and convertible were introduced in 2013 to sit below the larger [[BMW 4 Series]] models, with the new [[BMW M2]] high-performance model introduced in 2015.\n\nThe 2013-present [[Alfa Romeo 4C]] two-seat coupe and roadster used a carbon-fibre body and became Alfa's mid-engine sports car since the 1967-1969 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale.\n\nFiat had exited the roadster market with the end of [[Fiat Barchetta]] production in 2005. The company resumed production of roadsters in 2016 with the [[Fiat 124 Spider (2016)|Fiat 124 Spider]], which is based on the Mazda MX-5.\n\nIn 2017, Renault revived the Alpine brand for the 2017-present [[Alpine A110 (2017)|Alpine A110]] mid-engine coupe.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120px\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:Porsche 918 Spyder IAA 2013 (Zuschnitt).jpg |[[Porsche 918 Spyder]] <br/> (2013-2015)\nFile:Festival automobile international 2014 - Alfa Romeo 4C - 009.jpg |[[Alfa Romeo 4C]] <br/> (2013-2018)\nFile:Fiat 124 Spider 1368cc registered September 2016.jpg |[[Fiat 124 Spider (2016)|Fiat 124 Spider]] <br/> (2016-present)\n</gallery>\n\n== United States ==\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = 2014 Chevy Corvette Stingray in yellow at LA Auto Show.jpg\n| caption1          = [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)]] (2013-2019)\n}}\n\nDuring the 1910s and 1920s, American manufacturers of smaller sports cars included [[Apperson]], [[Kissel Motor Car Company|Kissel]], Marion, Midland, National, [[Overland Automobile|Overland]], [[Stoddard-Dayton]] and Thomas; manufacturers of larger sports cars included Chadwick, [[Mercer (car)|Mercer]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1912-mercer-raceabout/|title=1912 Mercer Raceabout|website=revsinstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702090650/https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1912-mercer-raceabout/|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Stutz Motor Company]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3517/Stutz-Bearcat.html|title=1914 - 1917 Stutz Bearcat - Images, Specifications and Information|work=Ultimatecarpage.com|access-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324072558/http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3517/Stutz-Bearcat.html|archivedate=24 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> and [[Crane-Simplex|Simplex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1914-simplex/|title=1914 Simplex |website=www.revsinstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702044906/https://revsinstitute.org/the-collection/1914-simplex/|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Georgano\"/>\n\nSince the 1960s, American performance cars have often been designed as [[muscle car]]s rather than sports cars.

The 11-F Super Sports was followed by the 1970-1977 [[Mitsubishi Galant GTO]] and 1971-1975 [[Mitsubishi Galant FTO]], both based on a platform shared with the Galant sedan. \n\nToyota's mass-production 2+2 coupes of the 1970s consisted of the Celica, Supra, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno.

Other 2+2 models included the 1982-1989 [[Mitsubishi Starion]] (turbocharged and rear-wheel drive) and the 1985-1991 [[Subaru XT]] (available with a turbocharger and all-wheel drive). Subaru have produced few sports cars in their history, instead focussing on rally-influenced sedans/hatchbacks for their performance models, such as the Liberty RS and Imprezza WRX/STi models.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Toyota MR2]] two-seat coupe became Japan's first production [[mid-engine]] car. The MR2 switched to a two-seat roadster body style for the final generation from 1999-2007.\n\nThe first Korean coupe model was the 1988 [[Hyundai Scoupe]], which used front-wheel drive and was based on Excel hatchback.

He also played guitar on the album ''In the Mushroom'' with Lid. Cavanagh also provided vocals on an album by French post rockers [[Spherical Minds]] and was a guest on the album ''Pure Air'' by [[Agua de Annique]], providing vocals and guitar on \"The Blowers Daughter\".\n\n==Background and early years==\nCavanagh was raised in [[Anfield]], [[Liverpool]], in a working-class family. He has mentioned that [[Dire Straits]] and in particular [[Mark Knopfler]] were his first musical influences, and along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] were responsible for leading the young Cavanagh towards learning guitar. The seed was cemented in 1985 with the [[Live Aid]] concert and this is an event that Cavanagh still mentions as being what he regards one of the finest moments in the history of music and of mankind.\nDuring his teenage years, Cavanagh discovered [[Iron Maiden]] who alongside bands like [[Metallica]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Slayer]], [[Bolt Thrower]] and later [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], was a major influence in his interest in extreme metal.\n\nCavanagh has been praised for his ability to combine these left field influences gracefully into his own sound without alienating his core fanbase.\n\n==With Anathema==\n\n\"Rise Pantheon Dreams\" was the original title of Anathema's follow up album to their debut \"Serenades\". During the sessions it became clear to the band that vocalist Darren White was not performing the vocals as the rest of the band had hoped and was asked to leave. Despite having no singing experience, Daniel's brother and co-guitarist Vincent stepped into the spot, which he has maintained to this day.  He is now regarded as one of the finest singers to have emerged from the genre. Eventually being released as \"The Silent Enigma\" in October 1995, the album cemented Anathema's status further and it was followed up just a year later with their third album, \"Eternity\". Eternity displayed a move from White's original [[death growl]] towards more \"clean\" vocals.\n\n===''Alternative 4'' era and family tragedy===\nDrummer John Douglas left the band for a short time ahead of the recording and release of ''[[Alternative 4 (album)|Alternative 4]]''; he was replaced by [[Shaun Steels]], formerly of Solstice and later of My Dying Bride.  ''Alternative 4'' was composed chiefly by Cavanagh and bassist [[Duncan Patterson]], met generally positive reviews, and marked the transition of the band from [[gothic metal]] towards a more alternative rock/goth sound.\n\nDisaster struck soon after the album release. First, the Cavanagh brothers tragically lost their mother; Duncan Patterson then left the band.  Despite all of this the band decided to focus on the development of a new album. John Douglas rejoined the band in time to tour the album and it took only a year before \"Judgement\" was released. Judgement was again met with positive reviews with allmusic giving it four out of five stars.\n\nApart from Vincent Cavanagh's vocals, Lee Douglas, younger sister of drummer John, made her debut appearance on the album and was eventually installed as a member of the band. Worth mentioning is \"One Last Goodbye\", a song penned by Daniel and sung by Vincent as a tribute to their mother, Helen. The brothers were very close with their mother and the song is a heartfelt tribute to her.\n\nAt this stage with Patterson gone, Cavanagh was in the spotlight as the driving musical force in the band and was rapidly being seen as a more influential figure in band's musical direction among the Anathema fans \u2013 affectionately known as Anathemaniacs.\n\n===Early 2000s===\n\n2001 saw \"A Fine Day To Exit\" and a shift in sound by the band. With a music video and lead single in \"Pressure\", the album was met with mixed response. Yet the song \"Temporary Peace\" became an Anathema classic to be mentioned in the same breath as songs like \"Deep\" or \"Empty\". This album was notable in that it was the debut of Les Smith on keyboards. It was also the album where John Douglas became noticed as a songwriter of considerable importance for the band, as he remains to the present day.\n\nEarly 2002 saw Daniel announce his departure from the band to reunite full-time with former band mate Duncan Patterson on his Antimatter project. This caused a negative response from Anathema fans worldwide as many felt Daniel was impossible to replace. The split was short lived thankfully as he was back to the band in time for the festival season that summer.\n\n\"A Natural Disaster\" saw Vincent's twin Jamie re-join the band on bass (a position he had held in the early days of the band). The resulting album was almost entirely composed by Daniel (with smaller contributions from the rest of the band) marking the end of a traumatic episode in his personal life. \"A Natural Disaster\" was overlooked in part due to Anathema's longtime label Music For Nations deciding to fold.  With no real gain to be made for a company that would soon be defunct, MFN did little to promote the album. Despite this, the touring for the album was successful and the seven-year gap that followed until the next album saw the band finally emerge as a professional touring outfit. \"A Natural Disaster\", despite the odds, has become somewhat of a cult hit amongst the fans, containing some of Cavanagh's best songwriting (\"Closer\") as well as seeing him hit new levels in raw open emotion (\"Electricity\").\n\nAnathema took massive steps towards becoming a professional live act during the seven years between albums with high-profile tours supporting [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] and [[Porcupine Tree]] expanding their fanbase. Cavanagh began to preview some new Anathema material during his solo shows, which led the band to record and release demo versions of future album songs for free on their official site.\n\n===''Hindsight'' and ''We're Here Because We're Here''===\n\nIn late 2008 Anathema's new label K-Scope released a collection of old songs re-recorded in semi acoustic fashion with one new track \"Tales of the Unexpected\" included. Despite notable changes, there was generally favourable reaction to the re-worked old songs. This was an important step towards Anathema deciding on K-Scope as their new label.\n\nFinally in May 2010, almost seven years after their last full album release, Anathema released their self-produced \"We're Here Because We're Here\" mixed by [[Steven Wilson]] of Porcupine Tree. The album has received massive response from all corners of the press and fan reactions have been positive. It was awarded the Prog Album of the Year award from media titan \"Classic Rock\".\n\n==Solo and acoustic==\nAround 2002 Daniel began to play solo shows throughout Europe, with himself on guitar and piano. These shows proved to be very popular amongst fans of the band as well as others curious to hear Danny's work. He successfully partnered for these shows with former [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]] vocalist [[Anneke Van Giersbergen]]. A short Norwegian tour in 2006 led to Cavanagh meeting Haavard from [[Aftermath Music]] in Trondheim, resulting in Haavard becoming Daniel's main booking agent for his solo jaunts for some time after. This trip was also of considerable importance as it began Cavanagh's interest in Norway, something that has had a massive impact on his life ever since. It led, indirectly, to Cavanagh meeting [[Christer-Andr\u00e9 Cederberg]] who produced Anathema's last two studio albums and guided the band into previously unheralded realms of mainstream success, not least with the song \"Anathema\" (from 'Distant Satellites') winning Anthem Of The Year at the 2014 Prog Awards, as voted for by the readers of Classic Rock's Prog Magazine.\n\nIn 2004 Cavanagh released 'A Place To Be' on Strangelight Records (run by ex-Anathema bassist Duncan Patterson) which featured him covering a collection of [[Nick Drake]] songs.\n2009 saw him team up with frequent live collaborator [[Anneke van Giersbergen]] for the release of 'In Parallel' which saw them add their own unique touch to a number of their own songs as well as songs from other artists.\nIn 2013 he collaborated with Joseph Geraci, whose discussions of his own near-death experience had been sampled for the Anathema track \"Internal Landscapes\" from the Weather Systems album in 2012. \nIn getting permission for the sample Cavanagh had been put in touch with Geraci and discovered that he had since amassed a large amount of writing based on the event, an event that Cavanagh had become quite touched by since learning of it.\nThe album 'Passage' was assembled and released in 2013 through [[Burning Shed]].\n\n2015 saw Cavanagh run a very successful [[PledgeMusic]] campaign for his album 'Memory And Meaning'.  The album sees him record intimate and stripped-down versions of songs that have shaped his musical self through the years and contains versions of songs from artists such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Iron Maiden]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2005 Cavanagh decided to quit alcohol<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 26 April 2017 | url = http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/interview.php?interview_id=549 | title =  Anathema interview (10/2009) | author1 = Ivor | author2 = Jeff | publicationdate = 25 October 2009 | date = 21 June 2008 | website = [[Metal Storm (magazine)|Metal Storm]] | location = Clisson, France }}</ref> and drugs, and pursue a more spiritual approach in his day-to-day life.

He also played guitar on the album ''In the Mushroom'' with Lid. Cavanagh also provided vocals on an album by French post rockers [[Spherical Minds]] and was a guest on the album ''Pure Air'' by [[Agua de Annique]], providing vocals and guitar on \"The Blowers Daughter\".\n\n==Background and early years==\nCavanagh was raised in [[Anfield]], [[Liverpool]], in a working-class family. He has mentioned that [[Dire Straits]] and in particular [[Mark Knopfler]] were his first musical influences, and along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] were responsible for leading the young Cavanagh towards learning guitar. The seed was cemented in 1985 with the [[Live Aid]] concert and this is an event that Cavanagh still mentions as being what he regards one of the finest moments in the history of music and of mankind.\nDuring his teenage years, Cavanagh discovered [[Iron Maiden]] who alongside bands like [[Metallica]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Slayer]], [[Bolt Thrower]] and later [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], was a major influence in his interest in extreme metal.\n\nCavanagh has been praised for his ability to combine these left field influences gracefully into his own sound without alienating his core fanbase.\n\n==With Anathema==\n\n\"Rise Pantheon Dreams\" was the original title of Anathema's follow up album to their debut \"Serenades\". During the sessions it became clear to the band that vocalist Darren White was not performing the vocals as the rest of the band had hoped and was asked to leave. Despite having no singing experience, Daniel's brother and co-guitarist Vincent stepped into the spot, which he has maintained to this day.  He is now regarded as one of the finest singers to have emerged from the genre. Eventually being released as \"The Silent Enigma\" in October 1995, the album cemented Anathema's status further and it was followed up just a year later with their third album, \"Eternity\". Eternity displayed a move from White's original [[death growl]] towards more \"clean\" vocals.\n\n===''Alternative 4'' era and family tragedy===\nDrummer John Douglas left the band for a short time ahead of the recording and release of ''[[Alternative 4 (album)|Alternative 4]]''; he was replaced by [[Shaun Steels]], formerly of Solstice and later of My Dying Bride.  ''Alternative 4'' was composed chiefly by Cavanagh and bassist [[Duncan Patterson]], met generally positive reviews, and marked the transition of the band from [[gothic metal]] towards a more alternative rock/goth sound.\n\nDisaster struck soon after the album release. First, the Cavanagh brothers tragically lost their mother; Duncan Patterson then left the band.  Despite all of this the band decided to focus on the development of a new album. John Douglas rejoined the band in time to tour the album and it took only a year before \"Judgement\" was released. Judgement was again met with positive reviews with allmusic giving it four out of five stars.\n\nApart from Vincent Cavanagh's vocals, Lee Douglas, younger sister of drummer John, made her debut appearance on the album and was eventually installed as a member of the band. Worth mentioning is \"One Last Goodbye\", a song penned by Daniel and sung by Vincent as a tribute to their mother, Helen. The brothers were very close with their mother and the song is a heartfelt tribute to her.\n\nAt this stage with Patterson gone, Cavanagh was in the spotlight as the driving musical force in the band and was rapidly being seen as a more influential figure in band's musical direction among the Anathema fans \u2013 affectionately known as Anathemaniacs.\n\n===Early 2000s===\n\n2001 saw \"A Fine Day To Exit\" and a shift in sound by the band. With a music video and lead single in \"Pressure\", the album was met with mixed response. Yet the song \"Temporary Peace\" became an Anathema classic to be mentioned in the same breath as songs like \"Deep\" or \"Empty\". This album was notable in that it was the debut of Les Smith on keyboards. It was also the album where John Douglas became noticed as a songwriter of considerable importance for the band, as he remains to the present day.\n\nEarly 2002 saw Daniel announce his departure from the band to reunite full-time with former band mate Duncan Patterson on his Antimatter project. This caused a negative response from Anathema fans worldwide as many felt Daniel was impossible to replace. The split was short lived thankfully as he was back to the band in time for the festival season that summer.\n\n\"A Natural Disaster\" saw Vincent's twin Jamie re-join the band on bass (a position he had held in the early days of the band). The resulting album was almost entirely composed by Daniel (with smaller contributions from the rest of the band) marking the end of a traumatic episode in his personal life. \"A Natural Disaster\" was overlooked in part due to Anathema's longtime label Music For Nations deciding to fold.  With no real gain to be made for a company that would soon be defunct, MFN did little to promote the album. Despite this, the touring for the album was successful and the seven-year gap that followed until the next album saw the band finally emerge as a professional touring outfit. \"A Natural Disaster\", despite the odds, has become somewhat of a cult hit amongst the fans, containing some of Cavanagh's best songwriting (\"Closer\") as well as seeing him hit new levels in raw open emotion (\"Electricity\").\n\nAnathema took massive steps towards becoming a professional live act during the seven years between albums with high-profile tours supporting [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] and [[Porcupine Tree]] expanding their fanbase. Cavanagh began to preview some new Anathema material during his solo shows, which led the band to record and release demo versions of future album songs for free on their official site.\n\n===''Hindsight'' and ''We're Here Because We're Here''===\n\nIn late 2008 Anathema's new label K-Scope released a collection of old songs re-recorded in semi acoustic fashion with one new track \"Tales of the Unexpected\" included.

[[Ful medames]] (dish of cooked fava beans), one of Egypt's several national dishes, is typical.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

[[Breakfast cereals]] or [[muesli]] with milk, yogurt or [[filmj\u00f6lk]], currants, and fruits are popular or warm [[whole-grain]] porridge with milk and jam (for example [[lingonberry jam]]).<ref>Rutiga kokboken, 2002, {{ISBN|91-534-1950-2}}</ref> [[Bilberry]]-soup ([[bl\u00e5b\u00e4rssoppa]]) and [[rose hip soup]] are also possible breakfast alternatives.\n\n===Switzerland===\n[[Switzerland|Swiss]] breakfasts are often similar to those eaten in neighboring countries.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The breakfast cereal [[Scott's Porage Oats]] was produced in [[Glasgow]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottsporage.co.uk/the-scotts-porage-story/our-heritage/#1|title=Scott's Porage \u2013 Our Heritage|publisher=Scott's Porage Oats|accessdate=19 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923232409/http://www.scottsporage.co.uk/the-scotts-porage-story/our-heritage/#1|archive-date=23 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before the arrival of American-style breakfast cereals in the early 20th century, dried bread soaked in hot milk or tea and porridge (boiled oats) was the common daily breakfast, while leftover vegetables (often, cabbage) and potatoes not eaten the night before were often served re-fried becoming '[[bubble and squeak|bubble-and-squeak]]';<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Caroline Conran, Traditional Cooking (British Cookery)1978 {{ISBN|0233 97053 3}}</ref> in [[Ireland]] the dish is known as [[colcannon]].

Black coffee or coffee with milk are traditional drinks. As this is the most common breakfast of the country, in [[Lim\u00f3n Province]] they prepare gallo pinto with coconut milk instead. Another popular breakfast food is the \"chorreadas\" which are savory sweetcorn pancakes; they are usually accompanied by cheese or a type of sour cream called \"natilla\".<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Costa Rica]]</ref>\n\n===Cuba===\nBreakfast in urban areas traditionally consists of [[caf\u00e9 con leche]] that is sweetened and includes a pinch of salt. Toasted buttered [[Cuban bread]], cut into lengths, is dunked in the coffee.

Normally accompanied by orange juice and other juices of fruits typical to the region. Milk punch (milk, egg, nutmeg, and malt) boiled eggs with \"harina de negrito\" or some other type of cornstarch. Traditional breakfast bread is a water-based bread.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Rep\u00fablica Dominicana]]</ref>\n\n===Guatemala===\nIn [[Guatemala]], breakfast consists of one or two eggs either fried, scrambled, or boiled accompanied by baked/fried beans with coffee. With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy).

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast. Thus there is no single standard Indian breakfast, with items changing with regions. However, one can broadly classify breakfast varieties in India into two types: North Indian and South Indian.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals.

This test exposes 40% of the front of the vehicle to an impact with a deformable barrier at approximately 40&nbsp;mph (65 km/h). \n\nAs with the NHTSA's frontal impact test, vehicles across different weight categories may not be directly compared.  This is because the heavier vehicle is generally considered to have an advantage if it encounters a lighter vehicle or is involved in a single-vehicle crash.  The IIHS demonstrated this by crashing three midsize sedans with three smaller \"Good\" rated minicars.

When the IIHS began its moderate overlap frontal test program in 1995, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' correspondent Lea Thompson was invited to watch its crash tests, and segments about the Institute's crash test programs became a regular feature on ''Dateline'' throughout the mid-1990s and 2000s. Other IIHS tests were later covered, including bumper crash tests, side-impact crash tests, and head restraint evaluation tests. Some of these segments are credited for pushing automakers into designing safer cars, such as when the IIHS tested the 1997-2005 [[GM U platform]] minivans. They were named the worst performing vehicles it had ever tested, with potentially fatal injuries for the driver. Their successors, offered from 2005\u20132009, were markedly improved, and received a \"Good\" rating from the Institute. The 1997-2003 [[Ford F-150]] was later named the 2nd worst performing vehicle, also with potentially fatal injuries for the driver. The redesigned 2004 Ford F-150 received a \"Good\" rating from the Institute. When Brian O'Neill stepped down as IIHS president in 2006, the IIHS segments were much shorter, and less frequent, until they ended around late-2006, when correspondent Lea Thompson left ''Dateline NBC.'' Many of these ''Dateline'' segments are available to watch on [[YouTube]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[BeSeatSmart Child Passenger Safety Program]]\n*[[Head injury criterion]]\n*[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]\n*[[New Car Assessment Program]]\n*[[Euro NCAP]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Insurance Institute for Highway Safety}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.iihs.org/ }}\n\n{{NCAP}}\n\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Arlington, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Automotive safety]]\n[[Category:Road safety organizations]]\n[[Category:New Car Assessment Programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirects here|IIHS|the social history archive|International Institute of Social History}}\n[[File:CF17005-111.jpg|thumb|IIHS Vehicle Research Center Crash Hall]]\n\nThe '''Insurance Institute for Highway Safety''' ('''IIHS''') is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[nonprofit organization]] funded by auto [[insurance companies]], established in 1959 and headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].

Their first test involved family cars, and most earned marginal or poor ratings. Only one vehicle, the [[Toyota Prius V]], earned a good rating when equipped with specific headlights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/first-ever-iihs-headlight-ratings-show-most-need-improvement |title=New IIHS ratings show most headlights are lacking |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2016-03-30 |accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref> The Institute evaluated headlights for small SUVs 4 months later, and none of the vehicles tested earn a good rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/most-small-suv-headlights-rate-poor-in-iihs-evaluations |title=Most small SUV headlights rate poor |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2016-07-12 |accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref> On October 2016, they released ratings for pickup trucks, and the [[Honda Ridgeline (2017\u2013present)|Honda Ridgeline]] was the only pickup to earn a good rating on the headlights test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/most-pickup-trucks-have-poor-headlights-iihs-tests-show |title=Pickups fall short in headlight testing |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2016-10-25 |accessdate=2017-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe Top Safety Pick is an annual award to the best-performing cars of the year.

Vehicles must also be available with headlights rated acceptable or good, a front crash prevention system rated superior or advanced, and receive an acceptable or good rating in the passenger side small overlap test.

When the IIHS began its moderate overlap frontal test program in 1995, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' correspondent Lea Thompson was invited to watch its crash tests, and segments about the Institute's crash test programs became a regular feature on ''Dateline'' throughout the mid-1990s and 2000s. Other IIHS tests were later covered, including bumper crash tests, side-impact crash tests, and head restraint evaluation tests. Some of these segments are credited for pushing automakers into designing safer cars, such as when the IIHS tested the 1997-2005 [[GM U platform]] minivans. They were named the worst performing vehicles it had ever tested, with potentially fatal injuries for the driver. Their successors, offered from 2005-2009, were markedly improved, and received a \"Good\" rating from the Institute. The 1997-2003 [[Ford F-150]] was later named the 2nd worst performing vehicle, also with potentially fatal injuries for the driver. The redesigned 2004 Ford F-150 received a \"Good\" rating from the Institute. When Brian O'Neill stepped down as IIHS president in 2006, the IIHS segments were much shorter, and less frequent, until they ended around late-2006, when correspondent Lea Thompson left ''Dateline NBC.'' Many of these ''Dateline'' segments are available to watch on [[YouTube]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[BeSeatSmart Child Passenger Safety Program]]\n*[[Head injury criterion]]\n*[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]\n*[[New Car Assessment Program]]\n*[[Euro NCAP]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Insurance Institute for Highway Safety}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.iihs.org/ }}\n\n{{NCAP}}\n\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Arlington, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Automotive safety]]\n[[Category:Road safety organizations]]\n[[Category:New Car Assessment Programs]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn the media:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2005-2009 \u2192 2005\u20132009", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety"}
