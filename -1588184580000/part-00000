In October 1987, it came to light through SEC-mandated disclosures that a group of investors led by Bilzerian had purchased 2.1 million Singer shares in the preceding two months. Singer seemed an unlikely target for a takeover: early reports cast doubt on the idea that the government would permit a hostile takeover of a defense contractor, and the company had already moved its headquarters from Connecticut to takeover-hostile New Jersey in an attempt to fend off a previous takeover by [[T. Boone Pickens]].<ref name=\"LATimes19871030\"/> In January 1988, Pickens provided $150 million in additional financing which helped Bilzerian acquire Singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/07/business/company-news-bilzerian-s-singer-bid-aided-by-pickens-loan.html|first=Robert J.|last=Cole|title=Bilzerian's Singer Bid Aided by Pickens Loan|work=The New York Times|date=1988-01-07|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nBilzerian's unexpected success was attributable to several factors. Singer chairman Joseph B. Flavin had died in early October, leaving the company without strong leadership to fight off the takeover attempt. The [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] crash less than two weeks later spooked competing investors.<ref name=\"NYT19880824\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/24/business/how-bilzerian-scored-at-singer.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|first=Alison Leigh|last=Cowan|title=How Bilzerian Scored at Singer|work=The New York Times|date=1988-08-24|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> Finally, the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987]] included provisions to disallow sales of assets in certain acquired businesses to be treated as [[capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains]] for tax purposes, making future takeover bids less attractive; however, takeover bids like Bilzerian's which were already outstanding on the date of the Act's passage were exempted from this tax increase.<ref name=\"NYT19880824\"/>\n\n==Stock parking case==\nIn 1986, the government stumbled onto an insider trading scheme whereby a Drexel Burnham investment banker named Dennis Levine was exchanging inside information for suitcases of cash from Ivan Boesky.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Payback: The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milkin and His Financial Revolution|last=Fischel|first=Daniel|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1995|isbn=0-88730-757-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/paybackconspirac00fisc/page/42 42]|url=https://archive.org/details/paybackconspirac00fisc/page/42}}</ref> This led to an indictment of Boyd Jefferies, the well known owner and Chairman of Jefferies & Company.<ref>Payback at 81-82.</ref>  Jefferies cut a deal to testify against three individuals in the corporate and investment banking community, including Bilzerian.<ref>Payback at 94-97; 299-305.</ref>  The SEC then went after Bilzerian - focusing its investigation on whether he had failed to timely make two Schedule 13(d) filings and whether he was required to disclose investors in his partnerships.<ref name=\"Payback at 94-97\">Payback at 94-97.</ref> In May 1988, the SEC began a probe against [[Edward J.

There were, broadly speaking, two different camps of opinion on Bilzerian's actions. Much of the public had a negative view of corporate takeovers in general and saw Bilzerian's activities as \"greenmail\", profiting by deceiving companies into believing they faced a hostile takeover attempt and scaring them into buying their stock from him at a high price.

Singer seemed an unlikely target for a takeover: early reports cast doubt on the idea that the government would permit a hostile takeover of a defense contractor, and the company had already moved its headquarters from Connecticut to takeover-hostile New Jersey in an attempt to fend off a previous takeover by [[T. Boone Pickens]].<ref name=\"LATimes19871030\"/> In January 1988, Pickens provided $150 million in additional financing which helped Bilzerian acquire Singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/07/business/company-news-bilzerian-s-singer-bid-aided-by-pickens-loan.html|first=Robert J.|last=Cole|title=Bilzerian's Singer Bid Aided by Pickens Loan|work=The New York Times|date=1988-01-07|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nBilzerian's unexpected success was attributable to several factors. Singer chairman Joseph B. Flavin had died in early October, leaving the company without strong leadership to fight off the takeover attempt.

There were, broadly speaking, two different camps of opinion on Bilzerian's actions. Much of the public had a negative view of corporate takeovers in general and saw Bilzerian's activities as \"greenmail\", profiting by deceiving companies into believing they faced a hostile takeover attempt and scaring them into buying their stock from him at a high price. In Bilzerian's case he never sought greenmail and always offered all other shareholders all cash for their shares at prices substantially above the market.<ref>Paul Bilzerian, St. Kitts interview, January 31, 2019</ref>  Many saw Bilzerian as guilty of nothing but making a profit in genuine-but-failed takeover attempts which benefited all investors.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribune19890115\"/> In an article in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], Christopher Byron questioned the entire basis of the case against Bilzerian, describing it as fueled by \"Puritan envy\". He further stated that the Department of Justice's primary motivation for the case was not the prosecution of wrongdoing but rather the need to justify its earlier unpopular [[plea bargain]] with Boyd Jeffries of [[Jefferies & Company]], which would see Jefferies avoid any jail time at all in exchange for the opportunity to \"drag some headline-sized names through the mud\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zucCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25|first=Christopher|last=Byron|title=Trials of a bungling raider|work=New York|date=1989-06-12|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>  Daniel Fischel, Dean of the University of Chicago Law School, argued Bilzerian was an innocent victim of an overzealous prosecutor, Rudy Guliani, and never should have been indicted as he was viewed as a hero to the shareholders of Cluett Peabody and Hammermill Paper Company.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Payback: The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milkin and His Financial Revolution|last=Fischel|first=Daniel|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1995|isbn=0-88730-757-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/paybackconspirac00fisc/page/93 93\u201397, 304]|url=https://archive.org/details/paybackconspirac00fisc/page/93}}</ref>\n\nAfter two days of deliberations in June, the jury found Bilzerian guilty on nine counts including conspiracy, making false statements, and securities law violations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-06-10/business/26105939_1_bilzerian-securities-and-tax-arthur-f-mathews|title=Bilzerian Guilty On 9 Counts In Securities Case|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1989-06-10|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> In September, Judge [[Robert Joseph Ward]] sentenced Bilzerian to four years in prison and a fine of $1.5 million because he \"now must pay the price\" for testifying in his own defense.

'''Dragon Boat Festival''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u7aef\u5348\u8282|t=\u7aef\u5348\u7bc0|first=t}}) is a traditional holiday originating in China, occurring near the [[summer solstice]]. The festival now occurs on the 5th day of the 5th month of the traditional [[Chinese calendar]], which is the source of the festival's alternative name, the '''Double Fifth Festival'''.<ref>\"[http://tour.tncg.gov.tw/English/culture/ct01.asp?type=12 Double Fifth (Dragon Boat) Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506213724/http://tour.tncg.gov.tw/English/culture/ct01.asp?type=12 |date=May 6, 2008 }}\".</ref> The Chinese calendar is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so the date of the festival varies from year to year on the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In 2017, it occurred on 29 May; in 2018, on 18 June; in 2019, on 7 June.and, in 2020, it will on 25 June.\n\n==History==\n\n===Superstition===\nThe fifth lunar month is considered an unlucky month. People believed that natural disasters and illnesses are common in the fifth month. In order to get rid of the misfortune, people would put calamus, Artemisia, pomegranate flowers, Chinese ixora and garlic above the doors in the fifth of May.<ref>{{cite web |title=Photos of the Chinese Traditional Festivals - Dragon Boat Festival |url=http://www.huanqiu.com/zhuanti/temp/zhuanti/history/oldpic3/52034/more.htm?agt=61 |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref> Since the shape of calamus forms like a sword and with the strong smell of the garlic, it is believed that they can remove the evil spirits.\n[[File:What people did in the Dragon Boat Festival.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Badluck.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Shoes to avoid bad luck.png|thumb]][[File:Activities to avoid bad luck.png|thumb]]\nOther origin of Dragon Boat festival : Before the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), the fifth month of the lunar calendar was regarded as a bad month and the fifth day of the month as a bad day, and known as the Dragon Boat festival nowadays. Poisonous animals will appear starting from this days such as snakes, centipedes and scorpions as well as that people may get sick easily after this day. Therefore, during the Dragon Boat Festival, people try any way to avoid bad luck. For example, people paste pictures of the five poisonous creatures on the wall and stick needles in them. People also make paper cuttings of the five creatures and wrapped these around the wrists of their children.<ref>{{Cite book|title='Beijing Review' Color Photographs|last=Liu|first=L.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=vol. 54, issue 23|pages=42\u201343}}</ref> Big ceremonies and performances developed from these practices in many areas, making the Dragon Boat Festival a day for getting rid of disease and bad luck.[[File:Qu Yuan.png|thumb|175px|A statue of [[Qu Yuan]] in [[Jingzhou]], at the site of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu]] capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]].|alt=]]\n\nDecorating doors by hanging wormwood and calamus plants is an important ritual of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that doing so will drive evil spirits and diseases away.\n\n===Qu Yuan===\n{{Main|Qu Yuan}}\nThe story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister [[Qu Yuan]] ({{circa|lk=no|340}}\u2013278 BC) of the [[state (Chinese)|ancient state]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the [[Warring States period]] of the [[Zhou Dynasty]].<ref name=scmp1>[http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=f1a731616886a110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=China&s=News SCMP].\" ''Earthquake and floods make for muted festival.''

However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason.<ref name=\"scmp1\" /> During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]. Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]], the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]].\n\nIt is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of [[dragon boat race]]s. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of [[sticky rice]] into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of ''[[zongzi]]''.<ref name=\"scmp1\" />\n\n===Wu Zixu===\n{{Main|Wu Zixu}}\nDespite the modern popularity of the Qu Yuan origin theory, in the former territory of the [[Wu (state)|Kingdom of Wu]], the festival commemorated [[Wu Zixu]] (died 484 BC), the Premier of Wu. [[Xi Shi]], a beautiful woman sent by King [[Goujian]] of the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]], was much loved by King [[Fuchai]] of Wu. Wu Zixu, seeing the dangerous plot of Goujian, warned Fuchai, who became angry at this remark. Wu Zixu was forced to commit suicide by Fuchai, with his body thrown into the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. After his death, in places such as [[Suzhou]], Wu Zixu is remembered during the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\n===Cao E===\n[[File:Cao E Temple.JPG|thumb|The front of the Cao E Temple, facing east, toward [[Cao'e River]], in [[Shangyu]], Zhejiang, China.]]\nAlthough Wu Zixu is commemorated in southeast [[Jiangsu]] and Qu Yuan elsewhere in China, much of Northeastern Zhejiang including the cities of [[Shaoxing]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Zhoushan]] celebrates the memory of the young girl Cao E ({{lang|zh|\u66f9\u5a25}}, AD 130\u2013144) instead. Cao E's father Cao Xu ({{lang|zh|\u66f9\u76f1}}) was a shaman who presided over local ceremonies at [[Shangyu]]. In 143, while presiding over a ceremony commemorating Wu Zixu during the Dragon Boat Festival, Cao Xu accidentally fell into the Shun River. Cao E, in an act of [[filial piety]], decided to find her father in the river, searching for 3 days trying to find him. After five days, she and her father were both found dead in the river from drowning. Eight years later, in 151, a temple was built in Shangyu dedicated to the memory of Cao E and her sacrifice for filial piety. The Shun River was renamed [[Cao'e River]] in her honor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dragonboatfestival.tk/2017/04/dragon-boat-festival-history.html|title=The river in which she jumped was renamed as Cao's River.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404220341/http://www.dragonboatfestival.tk/2017/04/dragon-boat-festival-history.html|archivedate=4 April 2017}}</ref>[[File:Visitors Tent at South Shore of Dajia Riverside Park in 2017 Taipei International Dragon Boat Race 20170530Na.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Dragon boat|Dragon Boat]] Races at [[Dajia Riverside Park|Dajia River Park]] in [[Taipei]].]]\n\n===Pre-existing holiday===\nModern research suggests that the stories of Qu Yuan or Wu Zixu were superimposed onto a pre-existing holiday tradition. The promotion of these stories might be encouraged by [[Confucius|Confucian]] scholars, seeking to legitimize and strengthen their influence in China.\n\nThe stories of both Qu Yuan and Wu Zixu were recorded in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', completed 187 and 393 years after the events, respectively, because historians wanted to praise both characters.\n[[File:Bakcang.JPG|thumb|Raw Rice Dumpling]]\nAnother theory, advanced by [[Wen Yiduo]], is that the Dragon Boat Festival originated from [[Chinese dragon|dragon worship]]. Support is drawn from two key traditions of the festival: the tradition of dragon boat racing and ''[[zongzi]]''. The food may have originally represented an offering to the [[dragon king]], while dragon boat racing naturally reflects reverence for the dragon and the active ''yang'' energy associated with it. This was merged with the tradition of visiting friends and family on boats.\n\nAnother suggestion is that the festival celebrates a widespread feature of east Asian agrarian societies: the harvest of winter wheat. Offerings were regularly made to deities and spirits at such times: in the ancient Yue, dragon kings; in the ancient Chu, Qu Yuan; in the ancient Wu, Wu Zixu (as a river god); in ancient Korea, mountain gods (see [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]]). As interactions between different regions increased, these similar festivals eventually merged into one holiday.\n\n===Early 20th Century===\n\nIn the early 20th Century the Dragon Boat Festival was observed from the first to the fifth days of the fifth month, and also known as the\nFestival of Five Poisonous Insects ({{zh|t=\u6bd2\u87f2\u7bc0|s=\u6bd2\u866b\u8282|p=D\u00fach\u00f3ng ji\u00e9}}).\n[[Princess Der Ling|Yu Der Ling]] writes in chapter 11 of her 1911 memoir \"Two Years in the Forbidden City\":\n<blockquote>\nThe first day of the fifth moon was a busy day for us all, as from the first to the fifth of the fifth moon was the festival of five poisonous insects, which I will explain later\u2014also called the Dragon Boat Festival. [...] Now about this Feast. It is also called the Dragon Boat Feast. The fifth of the fifth moon at noon was the most poisonous hour for the poisonous insects, and reptiles such as frogs, lizards, snakes, hide themselves in the mud, for that hour they are paralyzed. Some medical men search for them at that hour and place them in jars, and when they are dried, sometime use them as medicine. Her Majesty told me this, so that day I went all over everywhere and dug into the ground, but found nothing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Y\u00fc |first1=Der Ling |title=Two Years in the Forbidden City |date=1911 |publisher=T.

''[[China Internet Information Center]]''. Retrieved on 12 June 2013.</ref>\n\n===Dragon boat racing===\n\nDragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was slandered by jealous government officials and banished by king. Out of disappointment in the Chu monarch, he drowned himself into the Miluo river. The common people rushed to the water and tried to recover his body. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body, which is one of the origins of ''[[zongzi]]''.\n[[File:Zongzi.jpg|thumb|Red Bean Rice Dumpling]]\n\n===Zongzi (rice dumpling)===\nA notable part of celebrating Dragon Boat Festival is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs.\n\nThe reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day is because they are considered as a symbol of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (\u4e2d). This character has a positive connotation, used in words such as \u4e2d\u5956 (winning a prize or a mini prize).\n\n===Food related to 5===\n'Wu' (\u5348) in the name 'Duanwu' in Chinese has similar pronunciation as the number 5 in multiple dialects, and thus many regions have traditions of eating food that is related to the number 5. For example, the Guangdong and Hong Kong regions have the tradition of having congee made from 5 different beans.\n\n===Realgar wine===\nRealgar wine or xionghuang wine is a Chinese alcoholic drink that is made from Chinese yellow wine dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral (it is also known as \"rice wine\"). Realgarly, it is often used as a pesticide against mosquitoes and other biting insects during the hot summers, and as a common antidote against poison in ancient Asia.\n\n===5-colored silk-threaded braid===\nIn some regions of China, parents braid silk threads of 5 colors and put them on their children's wrists, on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that this will help keep bad spirits and disease away.\n\nOther common activities include hanging up icons of [[Zhong Kui]] (a mythic guardian figure), hanging [[mugwort]] and [[calamus (palm)|calamus]], taking long walks, and wearing perfumed medicine bags. Other traditional activities include a game of making an egg stand at noon (this \"game\" implies that if someone succeeds in making the egg stand at exactly 12:00 noon, that person will receive luck for the next year), and writing [[Magic (paranormal)|spells]]. All of these activities, together with the drinking of realgar wine or water, were regarded by the ancients and some today as effective in preventing disease or evil, while promoting health and well-being.\n\nIn the early years of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], Duanwu was celebrated as the \"Poets' Day\" due to Qu Yuan's status as China's first known poet. The [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] also sometimes conflate the [[Lichun|spring]] practice of [[egg-balancing]] with Duanwu.<ref name=dbfest>Huang, Ottavia. ''Hmmm, This Is What I Think'': \"[http://ottaviahuang.blogspot.de/2012/06/dragon-boat-festiva-time-to-balance-egg.html Dragon Boat Festival: Time to Balance an Egg]\". 24 June 2012. Accessed 3 November 2013.</ref>\n\nThe sun is considered to be at its strongest around the time of summer solstice, as the daylight in the northern hemisphere is the longest. The sun, like the [[Chinese dragon]], traditionally represents [[yang (concept)|masculine energy]], whereas the moon, like the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], traditionally represents [[yin (concept)|feminine energy]]. The summer solstice is considered the annual peak of male energy while the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, represents the annual peak of feminine energy. The masculine image of the dragon was thus associated with the Dragon Boat Festival.<ref>Chan, Arlene & al. ''Paddles Up!

Poisonous animals will appear starting from this days such as snakes, centipedes and scorpions as well as that people may get sick easily after this day. Therefore, during the Dragon Boat Festival, people try any way to avoid bad luck. For example, people paste pictures of the five poisonous creatures on the wall and stick needles in them. People also make paper cuttings of the five creatures and wrapped these around the wrists of their children.<ref>{{Cite book|title='Beijing Review' Color Photographs|last=Liu|first=L.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=vol. 54, issue 23|pages=42\u201343}}</ref> Big ceremonies and performances developed from these practices in many areas, making the Dragon Boat Festival a day for getting rid of disease and bad luck.[[File:Qu Yuan.png|thumb|175px|A statue of [[Qu Yuan]] in [[Jingzhou]], at the site of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu]] capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]].|alt=]]\n\nDecorating doors by hanging wormwood and calamus plants is an important ritual of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that doing so will drive evil spirits and diseases away.\n\n===Qu Yuan===\n{{Main|Qu Yuan}}\nThe story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister [[Qu Yuan]] ({{circa|lk=no|340}}\u2013278 BC) of the [[state (Chinese)|ancient state]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the [[Warring States period]] of the [[Zhou Dynasty]].<ref name=scmp1>[http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=f1a731616886a110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=China&s=News SCMP].\" ''Earthquake and floods make for muted festival.''

However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason.<ref name=\"scmp1\" /> During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]. Twenty-eight years later, Qin captured [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]], the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]].\n\nIt is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of [[dragon boat race]]s. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of [[sticky rice]] into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This is said to be the origin of ''[[zongzi]]''.<ref name=\"scmp1\" />\n\n===Wu Zixu===\n{{Main|Wu Zixu}}\nDespite the modern popularity of the Qu Yuan origin theory, in the former territory of the [[Wu (state)|Kingdom of Wu]], the festival commemorated [[Wu Zixu]] (died 484 BC), the Premier of Wu. [[Xi Shi]], a beautiful woman sent by King [[Goujian]] of the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]], was much loved by King [[Fuchai]] of Wu. Wu Zixu, seeing the dangerous plot of Goujian, warned Fuchai, who became angry at this remark. Wu Zixu was forced to commit suicide by Fuchai, with his body thrown into the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. After his death, in places such as [[Suzhou]], Wu Zixu is remembered during the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\n===Cao E===\n[[File:Cao E Temple.JPG|thumb|The front of the Cao E Temple, facing east, toward [[Cao'e River]], in [[Shangyu]], Zhejiang, China.]]\nAlthough Wu Zixu is commemorated in southeast [[Jiangsu]] and Qu Yuan elsewhere in China, much of Northeastern Zhejiang including the cities of [[Shaoxing]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Zhoushan]] celebrates the memory of the young girl Cao E ({{lang|zh|\u66f9\u5a25}}, AD 130\u2013144) instead. Cao E's father Cao Xu ({{lang|zh|\u66f9\u76f1}}) was a shaman who presided over local ceremonies at [[Shangyu]]. In 143, while presiding over a ceremony commemorating Wu Zixu during the Dragon Boat Festival, Cao Xu accidentally fell into the Shun River. Cao E, in an act of [[filial piety]], decided to find her father in the river, searching for 3 days trying to find him. After five days, she and her father were both found dead in the river from drowning. Eight years later, in 151, a temple was built in Shangyu dedicated to the memory of Cao E and her sacrifice for filial piety. The Shun River was renamed [[Cao'e River]] in her honor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dragonboatfestival.tk/2017/04/dragon-boat-festival-history.html|title=The river in which she jumped was renamed as Cao's River.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404220341/http://www.dragonboatfestival.tk/2017/04/dragon-boat-festival-history.html|archivedate=4 April 2017}}</ref>[[File:Visitors Tent at South Shore of Dajia Riverside Park in 2017 Taipei International Dragon Boat Race 20170530Na.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Dragon boat|Dragon Boat]] Races at [[Dajia Riverside Park|Dajia River Park]] in [[Taipei]].]]\n\n===Pre-existing holiday===\nModern research suggests that the stories of Qu Yuan or Wu Zixu were superimposed onto a pre-existing holiday tradition. The promotion of these stories might be encouraged by [[Confucius|Confucian]] scholars, seeking to legitimize and strengthen their influence in China.\n\nThe stories of both Qu Yuan and Wu Zixu were recorded in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', completed 187 and 393 years after the events, respectively, because historians wanted to praise both characters.\n[[File:Bakcang.JPG|thumb|Raw Rice Dumpling]]\nAnother theory, advanced by [[Wen Yiduo]], is that the Dragon Boat Festival originated from [[Chinese dragon|dragon worship]]. Support is drawn from two key traditions of the festival: the tradition of dragon boat racing and ''[[zongzi]]''. The food may have originally represented an offering to the [[dragon king]], while dragon boat racing naturally reflects reverence for the dragon and the active ''yang'' energy associated with it. This was merged with the tradition of visiting friends and family on boats.\n\nAnother suggestion is that the festival celebrates a widespread feature of east Asian agrarian societies: the harvest of winter wheat. Offerings were regularly made to deities and spirits at such times: in the ancient Yue, dragon kings; in the ancient Chu, Qu Yuan; in the ancient Wu, Wu Zixu (as a river god); in ancient Korea, mountain gods (see [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]]). As interactions between different regions increased, these similar festivals eventually merged into one holiday.\n\n===Early 20th Century===\n\nIn the early 20th Century the Dragon Boat Festival was observed from the first to the fifth days of the fifth month, and also known as the\nFestival of Five Poisonous Insects ({{zh|t=\u6bd2\u87f2\u7bc0|s=\u6bd2\u866b\u8282|p=D\u00fach\u00f3ng ji\u00e9}}).\n[[Princess Der Ling|Yu Der Ling]] writes in chapter 11 of her 1911 memoir \"Two Years in the Forbidden City\":\n<blockquote>\nThe first day of the fifth moon was a busy day for us all, as from the first to the fifth of the fifth moon was the festival of five poisonous insects, which I will explain later\u2014also called the Dragon Boat Festival. [...] Now about this Feast. It is also called the Dragon Boat Feast. The fifth of the fifth moon at noon was the most poisonous hour for the poisonous insects, and reptiles such as frogs, lizards, snakes, hide themselves in the mud, for that hour they are paralyzed. Some medical men search for them at that hour and place them in jars, and when they are dried, sometime use them as medicine. Her Majesty told me this, so that day I went all over everywhere and dug into the ground, but found nothing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Y\u00fc |first1=Der Ling |title=Two Years in the Forbidden City |date=1911 |publisher=T.

''[[China Internet Information Center]]''. Retrieved on 12 June 2013.</ref>\n\n===Dragon boat racing===\n\nDragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was slandered by jealous government officials and banished by king. Out of disappointment in the Chu monarch, he drowned himself into the Miluo river. The common people rushed to the water and tried to recover his body. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body, which is one of the origins of ''[[zongzi]]''.\n[[File:Zongzi.jpg|thumb|Red Bean Rice Dumpling]]\n\n===Zongzi (rice dumpling)===\nA notable part of celebrating Dragon Boat Festival is making and eating zongzi with family members and friends. People traditionally wrap zongzi in leaves of reed, lotus or banana forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, dates and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including marinated pork belly, sausage and salted duck eggs.\n\nThe reason why the Chinese eat zongzi on this special day is because they are considered as a symbol of luck, as the pronunciation of zong is very similar to the pronunciation of zhong (\u4e2d). This character has a positive connotation, used in words such as \u4e2d\u5956 (winning a prize or a mini prize).\n\n===Food related to 5===\n'Wu' (\u5348) in the name 'Duanwu' in Chinese has similar pronunciation as the number 5 in multiple dialects, and thus many regions have traditions of eating food that is related to the number 5. For example, the Guangdong and Hong Kong regions have the tradition of having congee made from 5 different beans.\n\n===Realgar wine===\nRealgar wine or xionghuang wine is a Chinese alcoholic drink that is made from Chinese yellow wine dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral (it is also known as \"rice wine\"). Realgarly, it is often used as a pesticide against mosquitoes and other biting insects during the hot summers, and as a common antidote against poison in ancient Asia.\n\n===5-colored silk-threaded braid===\nIn some regions of China, parents braid silk threads of 5 colors and put them on their children's wrists, on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that this will help keep bad spirits and disease away.\n\nOther common activities include hanging up icons of [[Zhong Kui]] (a mythic guardian figure), hanging [[mugwort]] and [[calamus (palm)|calamus]], taking long walks, and wearing perfumed medicine bags. Other traditional activities include a game of making an egg stand at noon (this \"game\" implies that if someone succeeds in making the egg stand at exactly 12:00 noon, that person will receive luck for the next year), and writing [[Magic (paranormal)|spells]]. All of these activities, together with the drinking of realgar wine or water, were regarded by the ancients and some today as effective in preventing disease or evil, while promoting health and well-being.\n\nIn the early years of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], Duanwu was celebrated as the \"Poets' Day\" due to Qu Yuan's status as China's first known poet. The [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] also sometimes conflate the [[Lichun|spring]] practice of [[egg-balancing]] with Duanwu.<ref name=dbfest>Huang, Ottavia.

The sun, like the [[Chinese dragon]], traditionally represents [[yang (concept)|masculine energy]], whereas the moon, like the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], traditionally represents [[yin (concept)|feminine energy]]. The summer solstice is considered the annual peak of male energy while the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, represents the annual peak of feminine energy. The masculine image of the dragon was thus associated with the Dragon Boat Festival.<ref>Chan, Arlene & al. ''Paddles Up!
