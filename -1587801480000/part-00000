Proposals that this subspecies may, in fact, consist of two races, on either side of the [[Great Dividing Range]], have recently been confirmed with the description of race ''schoddei'' from mallee woodland on the Eyre Peninsula, west to near the head of the Great Australian Bight, north-west through the Gawler Ranges and the Yellabinna region, at least to Maralinga.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = A. | year = 2019 | title = \nA new subspecies of White-eared Honeyeater ''Nesoptilotis leucotis'' (Meliphagidae) | doi = 10.25226/bboc.v139i2.2019.a9 | journal = Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 164-172 | doi-access = free }}</ref>. Evidence for this is that the populations on the eastern, coastal side of the Great Dividing Range have intense green upperparts, and are light greenish-yellow on the belly, whereas, populations in the western, inland side of the Great Dividing Range are a duller olive colour and become slightly smaller. The [[Nullarbor Plain]] separates this race from the race ''novaenorciae'', which is found in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=Morcombe />\nThe western race ''novaenorciae'' is categorised on the basis of size differences, being about 20% smaller than race ''leucotis''.<ref name=Pearce /> Both populations look very similar, but they have significant genetic differences. Populations of white-eared honeyeaters in Western Australia have significant genetic changes (2.23%) compared to eastern populations; however, there are no significant phenotypic changes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dolman | first1 = G | last2 = Joseph | first2 = L | year = 2015 | title = Evolutionary history of birds across southern Australia: structure, history and taxonomic implications of mitochondrial DNA diversity in an ecologically diverse suite of species | doi = 10.1071/MU14047 | journal = Emu | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 35\u201348 }}</ref>\nThe fourth recognised race is ''thomasi'', which is found on [[Kangaroo Island]] in [[South Australia]].\n\nPopulations of white-eared honeyeaters found in arid regions and the [[Mallee (Victoria)|Mallee]], as well as all populations of race ''novaenorciae'', do not need a shrub layer or understory in their habitat.<ref name=Pearce />\n\n==Behaviour==\nWhite-eared honeyeaters are usually solitary, but may also be found in small family groups.

These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people on the basis of [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. The ministers are indirectly responsible to the people themselves. But the handful of ministers are not expected to deal personally with the various problems of modern administration.

India. The [[Executive (government)|executive]] decisions are implemented by the Indian civil servants.\n\nIn the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people on the basis of [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. The ministers are indirectly responsible to the people themselves. But the handful of ministers are not expected to deal personally with the various problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants to enforce it.\n\n====Cabinet secretary====\n{{Main|Cabinet Secretary of India}}\nThe cabinet secretary ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{IAST|Ma\u1e43trima\u1e47\u1e0dala Saciva}}) is the top-most executive official and [[Civil Services of India|senior-most civil servant]] of the Government of India. The cabinet secretary is the ''[[ex-officio]]'' head of the Civil Services Board, the [[Cabinet Secretariat of India|Cabinet Secretariat]], the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) and head of all civil services under the rules of business of the government.\n\nThe cabinet secretary is generally the senior-most officer of the [[Indian Administrative Service]].

The [[Supreme Court of India]] consists of the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]] and 30 associate justices, all appointed by the president on the advice of the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice of India]]. The jury trials were abolished in India in the early 1960s, after the famous case ''[[KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra|KM Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra]]'', for reasons of being vulnerable to media and public pressure, as well as to being misled.\n\nUnlike its United States counterpart, the Indian justice system consists of a unitary system at both state and union level. The judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India]], [[High Courts of India|high courts]] at the state level, and [[District Courts of India|district courts]] and [[Sessions Court|sessions court]]s at the [[List of districts in India|district]] level.\n\n=== Supreme court ===\n{{Main|Supreme Court of India}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of India - 200705.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Supreme Court of India]].|alt=Building of the Supreme Court of India.]]\nThe [[Supreme Court of India]] is situated in [[New Delhi]], the capital region of [[India]].\n\nThe supreme court is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal under the [[Constitution of India]], the highest constitutional court, with the power of [[constitutional review]].

It safeguards [[fundamental rights]] of citizens and settles disputes between various governments in the country. As an advisory court, it hears matters which may specifically be referred to it under the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] by the president. It also may take cognisance of matters on its own (or 'suo moto'), without anyone drawing its attention to them.

It is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including [[writ]]s in the nature of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[prohibition]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'' and ''[[certiorari]]'' to enforce them. The supreme court has been conferred with power to direct transfer of any civil or criminal case from one state high court to another state high court, or from a court subordinate to another state high court and the supreme court. Although the proceedings in the supreme court arise out of the judgment or orders made by the subordinate courts, of late the supreme court has started entertaining matters in which interest of the public at large is involved. This may be done by any individual or group of persons either by filing a ''[[writ]] petition'' at the filing counter of the court, or by addressing a letter to the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice of India]], highlighting the question of public importance for redress.

quickly to wireless devices if a ballistic missile is heading toward Hawaii. If the missile is fired from North Korea, the missile would take approximately 20 minutes to reach Hawaii. [[United States Pacific Command|PACOM]] would take less than 5 minutes to make a determination that the missile could impact Hawaii and would then notify the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA). HI-EMA would issue the Civil Defense Warning (CDW) that an inbound missile could impact Hawaii and that people should Shelter-in-Place: ''Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned''. People in Hawaii would have 12 to 15 minutes before impact. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not required to be notified for approval to cancel an alert. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the President. FEMA can send alerts to targeted audiences but has not implemented this as of January 2018. Other states can take as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute a missile alert.

quickly to wireless devices if a ballistic missile is heading toward Hawaii. If the missile is fired from North Korea, the missile would take approximately 20 minutes to reach Hawaii. [[United States Pacific Command|PACOM]] would take less than 5 minutes to make a determination that the missile could impact Hawaii and would then notify the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA). HI-EMA would issue the Civil Defense Warning (CDW) that an inbound missile could impact Hawaii and that people should Shelter-in-Place: ''Get Inside, Stay Inside, and Stay Tuned''. People in Hawaii would have 12 to 15 minutes before impact. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not required to be notified for approval to cancel an alert. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the President. FEMA can send alerts to targeted audiences but has not implemented this as of January 2018. Other states can take as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute a missile alert.

In Gopalpur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n==History==\nGopalpur also has an ancient, commercial port, now lying in ruins. Under the ownership of the Soraine family the village grew in wealth, from an obscure little fishing village, Gopalpur became a prominent trading port. The family built the port, the lighthouse and the Albert Hotel and established both a local fishing industry and a trade route with Burma.\n\nThey also established the bylaw allowing any villagers who could build a house, with a perimeter and light a fire in the fireplace overnight, could then keep the land and house (on the backwaters) as their own.\n\nDuring the British rule family squabbles and disputes resulted in much being transferred to British missionaries. The Albert Hotel now locked in ownership battles and lying derelict is the last remnant of those squabbles.\n\nDuring the days of [[British East India Company]] The [[East India Company]] built large [[warehouse]]s and [[godown]]s because the trade with [[Burma]] had picked up and it had become a trading point for rice from [[Rangoon]].\n\nVictor Soraine returned to India from England and built BetVic house where he retired, surrounded by memories of childhood and his family legacy. His final wish was granted when he was buried in his ancestral lands just a few years ago.\n\nGopalpur has reverted to being a quiet, relaxed place but with one major difference \u2014 it is one of India's most sought after beaches, with a distinct charm of its own.\n\n==Beach==\n[[File:Gopalpur Sea Beach.jpg|750px|center|thumb|Panorama view of Gopalpur Sea Beach]]\nBarely 16&nbsp;km away from [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], the commercial hub of southern [[Odisha]] and close to the border of [[Andhra Pradesh]], is the tiny town of Gopalpur on the [[Bay of Bengal]].

Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Gopalpur has an average literacy rate of 59%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 59%, and female literacy is 42%. In Gopalpur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n==History==\nGopalpur also has an ancient, commercial port, now lying in ruins. Under the ownership of the Soraine family the village grew in wealth, from an obscure little fishing village, Gopalpur became a prominent trading port. The family built the port, the lighthouse and the Albert Hotel and established both a local fishing industry and a trade route with Burma.\n\nThey also established the bylaw allowing any villagers who could build a house, with a perimeter and light a fire in the fireplace overnight, could then keep the land and house (on the backwaters) as their own.\n\nDuring the British rule family squabbles and disputes resulted in much being transferred to British missionaries. The Albert Hotel now locked in ownership battles and lying derelict is the last remnant of those squabbles.\n\nDuring the days of [[British East India Company]] The [[East India Company]] built large [[warehouse]]s and [[godown]]s because the trade with [[Burma]] had picked up and it had become a trading point for rice from [[Rangoon]].\n\nVictor Soraine returned to India from England and built BetVic house where he retired, surrounded by memories of childhood and his family legacy. His final wish was granted when he was buried in his ancestral lands just a few years ago.\n\nGopalpur has reverted to being a quiet, relaxed place but with one major difference \u2014 it is one of India's most sought after beaches, with a distinct charm of its own.\n\n==Beach==\n[[File:Gopalpur Sea Beach.jpg|750px|center|thumb|Panorama view of Gopalpur Sea Beach]]\nBarely 16&nbsp;km away from [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], the commercial hub of southern [[Odisha]] and close to the border of [[Andhra Pradesh]], is the tiny town of Gopalpur on the [[Bay of Bengal]]. This languorous beach with coconut groves, casuarinas and gentle sand dunes is deserted for miles.\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Gopalpur 's busy beach.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to Gopalpur Beach]]\nRenovated in the 1970s at the initiative of the [[Odisha]] government, the jetties were supposed to revive the trading activities of Gopalpur port. The old jetty in Gopalpur is tourist attraction point, which was a major point for trade and commerce in medieval times. The sailors of those time started their journey from this jetty to [[Indonesia]] and Rangoon across the Indian Sea. Once the renovation of new jetty completed it will become an important port of south [[Odisha]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Gopalpur-on-Sea|url=http://www.holidayiq.com/Gopalpur-on-Sea-Taptapani-Sightseeing-1329-14479.html|publisher=HolidayIQ|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref> It's a wonderful drive-in for the people and from the beach, a vast expanse of deep blue sea and the horizon can be seen.

The next day, a 500-man cavalry troop under General Ghulam Ali Khan escorted Suffren, six of his captains and several officers to the encampment of Hyder Ali's army for a meeting with him.<ref name=Hennequin306 /> Suffren announced that Bussy-Castelnau had arrived to Isle de France with 6 ships of the line, 2 frigates and transports carrying 5,000 soldiers. He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees. He then ajourned the meeting until the next day.<ref name=Hennequin308>Hennequin, p.308</ref>{{refn|Suffren received 10,000 rupees symbolising the gift of an elephant, which would have been inconvenient on ''H\u00e9ros''; his officers received 1,000 symbolising horses, for the same reason.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}}\n\nOn 27, Hyder Ali invited Suffren and Piveron to a private dinner, with European-style seating in deference to his guests.<ref name=Hennequin309>Hennequin, p.309</ref>{{refn|The previous day, Suffren, who was overweight, had suffered from the Indian-style seating and Hyder Ali had graciously bent the etiquette to accomodate him.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}} Suffren reported on the battles against Hughes, and they reviewed plans of operations against the British. Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] called him \"perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced'.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref> In ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports.

Suffren rushed with his warships to protect the convoy, and Hughes ordered his ships to regroup and form a [[line of battle]].<ref name=cunat109>Cunat, p.109</ref> In the morning of 17 February, the fleets were about 6 km apart{{refn|one [[League (unit)|League]] and a half<ref name=cunat109 />|group=Note}}, the British forming a line and had captured ''Lawriston'', while the French were scattered due to an error in interpreting night signals. Suffren formed a line without consideration for the order of battle,<ref name=cunat111>Cunat, p.111</ref> and at 1500 he closed in within gun range, starting the [[Battle of Sadras]].\n\nSuffren sustained about 30 men killed and 100 wounded,<ref name=cunat115>Cunat, p.115</ref> and light damage to his riggings.<ref name=cunat116>Cunat, p.116</ref> At 1900 he broke contact.<ref name=cunat115 />\n\n==== Battle of Providien ====\n{{Main|Battle of Providien}}\nSuffren returned to [[Pondich\u00e9ry]], where he arrived on 19 February 1782 and learned that the British squadron was heading for [[Trincomalee]]. After consulting [[Hyder Ali]], he decided not to land his troops in Pondich\u00e9ry, and rather to head for [[Parangipettai|Porto Nove]], where he arrived on 23 February. <ref name=hennequin299>Hennequin, p.299</ref> Hyder Ali despatched [[Andr\u00e9 Piveron de Morlat]], the French ambassador, to act as an intermediary between Suffren and himself, along with two of his officiers. Suffren negotiated an agreement that French troops would retain their own command; that a 4,000-man cavalry and 6,000-man infantry force would reinforce them; and that they be paid 24 [[Lakh]] rupee a year.<ref name=hennequin302>Hennequin, p.302</ref> Suffren landed his troops at Porto Nove, and departed on 23 March to search for the British fleet.\n\nOn 10 April, the two fleet came into view, and they spent two days in manoeuvers, trying to gain an advantage on the other.<ref name=hennequin302 /> In the morning, ''Fine'' captured a British courier and managed to retrieve the despatches that her captain had thrown overboard, revealing British plans to expel the Dutch from Ceylon.<ref name=cunat127>Cunat, p. 127</ref>   On 12, the [[Battle of Providien]] broke out, leaving both squadrons damaged. Suffren retreated to the safety of the Dutch forts of [[Batticaloa|Batacalo]] to repair, and tend to those members of his crews who were wounded or suffered from scurvy.<ref name=hennequin302 />\n\n==== Battle of Negapatam ====\n{{Main|Battle of Negapatam (1782)}}\nOn 3 June, Suffren departed Batacalo and sailed to [[Cuddalore]], where he received letters from Hyder Ali requesting that he lay siege to [[Nagapattinam]]. The French troops reembarked on their transports, when ''Bellone'', which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam. Suffren ordered an immediate departure and found the British ships anchored when he arrived on 6 July 1782.<ref name=Hennequin303>Hennequin, p.303</ref> Before the battle, Suffren despatched [[French frigate Pourvoyeuse (1772)|''Pourvoyeuse'']] to [[Malacca]], [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''R\u00e9solution'']] to [[Manila]], and [[Fortitude (1780 EIC ship)|''Fortitude'']] and [[Yarmouth (1782 ship)|''Yarmouth'']] to Isle de France, to purchase spare [[Spar (sailing)|spars]], food and ammunition to resupply his fleet. He furtermore kept [[French corvette Sylphide (1763)|''Sylphide'']] and [[French corvette Diligent (1781)|''Diligent'']] handy to bring news of the outcome of the battle to Isle de France.<ref name=cunat164>Cunat, p.164</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)|Battle of Negapatam]] ensued. The two fleet exchanged fire to over 4 hours, until Hughes retreated.<ref name=Hennequin303 /> During the battle,  Captain [[Chevalier de Villeneuve-Cillart|Cillart]],<ref name=threedeck-cillart>{{cite web |title=de Cillart (Chevalier de Cillart) |url=https://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_crewman&id=38982 |website=Three Deck's Forum}}</ref>{{refn|Also known as Villeneuve-Cilart <ref name=threedeck-cillart />|group=Note}} captain of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', panicked and [[Striking the colors|struck his colours]] but one of the officers, named Dieu and Kerlero de Rosbo,<ref name=roche414>Roche, p.414</ref> refused to surrender and resumed firing.

Suffren answered that he was unaware that ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' had surrendered and promised to launch an investigation, and also warned that without orders from his government he was not at liberty to give away his ships.<ref name=Hennequin304 /> \n\nFollowing the incident with ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', Suffren relieved Cillart of duty and sent him back to Isle de France to be returned to France and [[court-martial]]ed.<ref name=cunat179>Cunat, p. 179</ref> He also dismissed [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph-Hippolyte Bid\u00e9 de Maurville|Maurville]] of ''Art\u00e9sien'',  Forbin of ''Vengeur'' and De Ruyter of ''Pourvoyeuse'', as well as three more junior officers.<ref name=Hennequin306 /> Command of ''Art\u00e9sien'' went to [[Armand de Saint-F\u00e9lix|Saint-F\u00e9lix]]; that of ''Vengeur'' went to [[Louis-Hyacinte de Cavelier de Cuverville|Cuverville]], himself replaced by Lieutenant [[\u00c9l\u00e9onor Jacques Marie Stanislas P\u00e9rier de Salvert|P\u00e9rier de Salvert]] at the command of ''Flamand''; Lieutenant Maureville de Langle was promoted to the command of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; ''Brillant'' went to [[Jean Andr\u00e9 de Pas de Beaulieu|Beaulieu]], himself replaced on ''Bellone'' by Chevalier de Pierre-Vert; and Lieutenant de Beaumont le Ma\u00eetre received command of ''Ajax''.<ref name=cunat180>Cunat, p.180</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Trincomalee ====\n{{Main|Battle of Trincomalee}}\n[[File:Suffren meeting with Haider Ali, 26 july 1782 engraved by J B Morret 1789.jpg|thumb|Suffren meeting with [[Hyder Ali]] on 26 July 1782. Engraving by [[Jean-Baptiste Morret]], 1789.]]\nOn 25 July, Hyder Ali arrived at [[Bahour]] under the gun salutes of the fortress and the whole French squadron. The next day, a 500-man cavalry troop under General Ghulam Ali Khan escorted Suffren, six of his captains and several officers to the encampment of Hyder Ali's army for a meeting with him.<ref name=Hennequin306 /> Suffren announced that Bussy-Castelnau had arrived to Isle de France with 6 ships of the line, 2 frigates and transports carrying 5,000 soldiers. He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees. He then ajourned the meeting until the next day.<ref name=Hennequin308>Hennequin, p.308</ref>{{refn|Suffren received 10,000 rupees symbolising the gift of an elephant, which would have been inconvenient on ''H\u00e9ros''; his officers received 1,000 symbolising horses, for the same reason.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}}\n\nOn 27, Hyder Ali invited Suffren and Piveron to a private dinner, with European-style seating in deference to his guests.<ref name=Hennequin309>Hennequin, p.309</ref>{{refn|The previous day, Suffren, who was overweight, had suffered from the Indian-style seating and Hyder Ali had graciously bent the etiquette to accomodate him.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}} Suffren reported on the battles against Hughes, and they reviewed plans of operations against the British. Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] called him \"perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced'.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref> In ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports.

In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s [[rescue]] board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.\n\nThe first agencies to receive [[Jet Skis]] were Long Beach and Huntington Beach City Lifeguard departments in [[California]].  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.\n\nThe pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from [[North Carolina]] on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, [[Oregon]], USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from [[lifeguards]] and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the [http://www.PWCoffshore.com PWCoffshore.com] point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called [[offshore powerboat racing]] under [[American Power Boat Association]] sanctioning.

In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s [[rescue]] board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.\n\nThe first agencies to receive [[Jet Skis]] were Long Beach and Huntington Beach City Lifeguard departments in [[California]].  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.\n\nThe pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from [[North Carolina]] on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, [[Oregon]], USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from [[lifeguards]] and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the [http://www.PWCoffshore.com PWCoffshore.com] point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called [[offshore powerboat racing]] under [[American Power Boat Association]] sanctioning.

The coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm (like a grass), enabling farmers and real estate developers to clear land with fewer restrictions.\n\nRice is the main food crop, and pulses (legume), ''Ragi'' (Finger Millet) and other food crops are also grown. Main cash crops are coconut, cashewnut, arecanut, sugarcane and fruits like pineapple, mango and banana.<ref name=\"nic1\" /> Goa's state animal is the [[Gaur]], the state bird is the Ruby Throated Yellow Bulbul, which is a variation of [[Black-crested Bulbul]], and the state tree is the [[Terminalia tomentosa|Matti (Asna)]].\n\nThe important forests products are bamboo canes, [[Maratha]] barks, chillar barks and the [[bhirand]]. Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of Goa barring the elevated regions. A large number of [[deciduous]] trees, such as teak, Sal tree, cashew and mango trees are present. Fruits include jackfruit, mango, pineapple and \"black-berry\" (\"podkoam\" in Konkani language). Goa's forests are rich with medicinal plants.\n\n[[File:Goa Fields.JPG|thumb|left|[[Paddy field|Rice paddies]] are common in rural Goa.]]\nFoxes, wild boar and migratory birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The avifauna (bird species) includes kingfisher, ''myna'' and parrot. Numerous types of fish are also caught off the coast of Goa and in its rivers. Crab, lobster, shrimp, jellyfish, oysters and catfish are the basis of the marine fishery. Goa also has a high snake population. Goa has many famous \"National Parks\", including the renowned [[Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary]] on the island of [[Chor\u00e3o (Island)|Chor\u00e3o]]. Other wildlife sanctuaries include the [[Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Molem Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Madei Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary]], and [[Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary]].\n\nGoa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38&nbsp;km\u00b2) of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Park.

Iron, bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone, and silica are mined. The [[Mormugao]] port handled 31.69&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo last year, which was 39% of India's total iron ore exports. [[Sesa Goa]] (now owned by Vedanta Resources) and Dempo are the lead miners. Rampant mining has been depleting the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Corporations are also mining illegally in some areas. During 2015\u201316, the total traffic handled by Mormugao port was recorded to be 20.78&nbsp;million tonnes.\n\nAgriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew, and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.\n\nMedium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products.\n\nCurrently, there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs) in Goa after strong opposition to them by political parties and the powerful Goa Catholic Church.<ref name=goasez>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms|title=Goa not to have any more SEZs|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=The Times of India|date=13 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132502/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms#|archive-date=11 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGoa is also notable for its low priced beer, wine, and spirits prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol. Another main source of cash inflow to the state is remittance, from many of its citizens who work abroad, to their families. It is said to have some of the largest bank savings in the country.\n\nGoa is the second state in India to achieve a 100 percent automatic telephone system with a solid network of telephone exchanges.

After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the [[Adil Shahi]]s of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], who established as their auxiliary capital the city known under the Portuguese as [[Velha Goa]] (or Old Goa).<ref name=dobbie>{{cite book|last=Dobbie|first=Aline|title=India: The Elephant's Blessing|year=2006|publisher=Melrose Press|pages=253 pages (see page 220)}}</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nMahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla (12th century).jpg|The [[Mahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla|Mahadev Temple]], attributed to the [[Kadambas of Goa]]; in what is today [[Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park]].\nKadamba.PNG|Gold coins issued by the Kadamba king of Goa, Shivachitta Paramadideva.

Iron, bauxite, manganese, clays, limestone, and silica are mined. The [[Mormugao]] port handled 31.69&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo last year, which was 39% of India's total iron ore exports. [[Sesa Goa]] (now owned by Vedanta Resources) and Dempo are the lead miners. Rampant mining has been depleting the forest cover as well as posing a health hazard to the local population. Corporations are also mining illegally in some areas. During 2015\u201316, the total traffic handled by Mormugao port was recorded to be 20.78&nbsp;million tonnes.\n\nAgriculture, while of shrinking importance to the economy over the past four decades, offers part-time employment to a sizeable portion of the populace. Rice is the main agricultural crop, followed by areca, cashew, and coconut. Fishing employs about 40,000 people, though recent official figures indicate a decline of the importance of this sector and also a fall in catch, due perhaps, to traditional fishing giving way to large-scale mechanised trawling.\n\nMedium scale industries include the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilisers, tyres, tubes, footwear, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, wheat products, steel rolling, fruits and fish canning, cashew nuts, textiles, brewery products.\n\nCurrently, there are 16 planned SEZs in Goa. The Goa government has recently decided to not allow any more [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs) in Goa after strong opposition to them by political parties and the powerful Goa Catholic Church.<ref name=goasez>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms|title=Goa not to have any more SEZs|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=The Times of India|date=13 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132502/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Business/India_Business/Goa_not_to_have_any_more_SEZs_Digamber_Kamat/rssarticleshow/2538932.cms#|archive-date=11 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGoa is also notable for its low priced beer, wine, and spirits prices due to its very low excise duty on alcohol. Another main source of cash inflow to the state is remittance, from many of its citizens who work abroad, to their families. It is said to have some of the largest bank savings in the country.\n\nGoa is the second state in India to achieve a 100 percent automatic telephone system with a solid network of telephone exchanges. As of September 2017, Goa had a total installed power generation capacity of 547.88 MW.

Goan's are avid football fans, particularly of the football teams from Portugal (Benfica, Sporting), and Brazil especially during major football events such as the 'European Cup' and the 'World Cup' championships. The Portuguese footballer 'Ronaldo' and Brazilian 'Neymar', are revered superstar football players in Goa.\n\nGoa also has its own [[Goa cricket team|cricket team]].

The Portuguese set up seminaries for religious education and parish schools for elementary education. Founded circa 1542 by Saint Francis Xavier, [[Saint Paul's College, Goa]] was a Jesuit school in Old Goa, which later became a college. St Paul's was once the main Jesuit institution in the whole of Asia. It housed the first printing press in India and published the first books in 1556.\n\nMedical education began in 1801 with the offering of regular medical courses at the Royal and Military Hospital in the old City of Goa.

The area is influenced by diurnal tidal cycles; the tidal fluctuations vary depending on seasons and are most pronounced during the monsoon season.\nOn three sides of Noakhali an [[alluvial plain]] that is inundated annually and fertilized by [[silt]] deposits from the Meghna estuary. The swift currents that course down from the [[Himalayas]] carry rich fertile silt. When it reaches the Bay of Bengal the silt settles along the coast gradually forming new land called the \"chars\".

It was part of [[Pundra Kingdom]]. \n\nIn the 1660s, the agricultural activities of the north-eastern region of Bhulua were seriously affected by floodwaters of the [[Dakatia River]] flowing from the [[Tripura]] hills. To salvage the situation, a canal was dug in 1660 that ran from the Dakatia through Ramganj, Sonaimuri and Chaumuhani to divert water flow to the junction of the [[Meghna River]] and [[Feni River|Feni]]. After excavating this long canal, Bhulua began to be known as \"Noakhali\". The name \"Noakhali\" originated from the terms \"Noa\" (New) and \"Khal\" (Canal).\n\nTwo hundred years ago Noakhali district was known as Bhulua Pargana. South Shahbazpur(Bhola), Lakshmipur, the mainland of Noakhali district and a portion of the present Feni district were included in the Bhulua Pargana. In 1821 Mr. Plyden, a salt agent, was the additional position of [[collectorate]] (district judge) of Bhulua by the governor general. He proposed to the governor general to establish a new district when some administrative problems arose with other Bhulua salt-agents. On 29 March 1822 the Governor General passed an order in this regard and accordingly a new district was constituted with: South Shabajpur,  Sudharam,  Begumganj,  Ramganj, Raipur, Lakshmipur,  Feni, Parshuram, Elahabad Pargana of Tippera and Hatia, Sandwhip and Bamni of Chittagong district. The district was named Noakhali in 1868.\nIn 1876 Noakhali district was divided into two sub-divisions.  Feni Sub-division was constituted with: Chhagalnaiya thana of Tippera, Mirshari of Chittagong, Feni Pargana, Parshuram and Sonagazi. Sadar Sub-division was formed with the remaining areas. In the 1901 census its area was {{cvt|1,644|mi2}} and its population was about 1,141,728.<ref name=\"The Pioneer Press\">{{cite book|last1= Webster|first1=J.E|title=Eastern Bengal and Assam District Gazetteers:Noakhali.|date=1911|publisher=The Pioneer Press|location= Allahbad|isbn= |url=https://archive.org/details/noakhali00webs}}</ref>\n[[Noakhali riots|Regional violence in 1946]] escalated communal tensions throughout [[British Raj|British India]] just before the [[Partition of India|1947 partition]]. One of the worst religious massacres and incidents of ethnic cleansing against the  Hindu community took place in Noakhali during the 1946 riot known as the [[Noakhali genocide]]. A huge number of mass killing, raping, looting, and forcible conversions took place. The prime minister of Bengal, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, answering a question from [[Dhirendranath Datta]] in the assembly early in 1947 stated that there had been 9,895 cases of forcible conversion in Tipperah alone. He said the number in Noakhali \"ran into thousands\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batabyal |first1=Rakesh |date=2005 |title=Communalism in Bengal: From Famine to Noakhali, 1943\u201347 |location=New Delhi |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |p=282 |isbn=81-7829-471-0 |quote=H.S.

After that the headquarters of Noakhali was established at [[Maijdee]]. In 1964, Sadar Sub-division was divided into two sub-divisions namely Sadar and Lakshmipur.\n\n[[File:\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c7\u09b0_\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09bf\u0995_%28\u09e7\u09ef\u09ec\u09ed-\u09e7\u09ef\u09ed\u09e7%29_\u09aa\u09b0\u09bf\u0995\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09be.png|thumb|240px|Pakistani Eastern Command plan for the defense of East Pakistan from 1967 to 1971 (generic representation\u2014some unit locations not shown.]]\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] for the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation of Bangladesh]], when [[Pakistan Army]] created the 39th ''ad hoc'' Division in mid-November, from the 14th Division units deployed in those areas, to hold on to the Comilla and [[Noakhali]] districts, and the 14th Division was tasked to defend the Sylhet and Brahmanbaria areas only.<ref>Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp126</ref> During the War of Liberation many direct and guerilla encounters took place between the Pakistani Armed Forces and the Liberation Forces (Mukti Bahini).{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} During the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|1971 Bangladesh genocide by the Pakistan]], in which Pakistani Army and its supporting [[militia]]s ([[Razakar (Pakistan)|Razakar]]) killed estimated between 300,000<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16207201|title=Bangladesh war: The article that changed history \u2013 Asia |publisher=BBC |date=25 March 2010}}</ref> to 3,000,000 people and raped 200,000\u2013400,000 [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] women in a systematic campaign of [[genocidal rape]],{{sfn|Sharlach|2000|pp=92\u201393}}{{sfn|Sajjad|2012|p=225}}<ref name=\"MathewWhite\">White, Matthew, ''[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm#Bangladesh Death Tolls for the Major Wars and Atrocities of the Twentieth Century]''</ref> about 75 Bengladeshi Freedom fighters (Mukti Joddha) were killed at Noakkhali in a direct encounter with the Pakistan army on 15 June 1971, in front of the Sonapur Ahmadia School.

Field level functionaries of the development departments operate here at the grass-root level under guidance from the respective functional heads stationed in the districts as coordinated by the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO). All decisions are discussed and finalized in a forum called the Upazila Parishad which is presided over by an elected chairman and assisted by the UNO.\n\nAn area covering several square kilometers having a population of several thousand populations is called a Union, administered by an elected chairman.

The district of Noakhali has 4,159 mosques, 497 Eid Gah, 239 temples, two Buddhist pagodas and two churches.<ref name=\"District Statistics 2011,Noakhali\">{{citation|title=District Statistics 2011,Noakhali|publisher=Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics(BBS)|url=http://www.bbs.gov.bd/webtestapplication/userfiles/Image/District%20Statistics/Noakhali.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026103943/http://www.bbs.gov.bd/webtestapplication/userfiles/Image/District%20Statistics/Noakhali.pdf|archivedate=26 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Language===\nThe people of this district speak [[Noakhailla language|Noakhailla]] which is a [[Bengali-Assamese languages|Bengali-Assamese language]] of Bangladesh. It is not only spoken by the people of Noakhal but also the people of [[Feni District|Feni]] and [[Lakshmipur District|Lakshmipur]] as well as southern parts of the district of [[Comilla]],  [[Mirsharai Upazila]], [[Sandwip]] of [[Chittagong]]<nowiki/>district, [[Haziganj Upazila]] of [[Chadpur]] district.  Indian nationals of [[Tripura]] state also speak the dialect of Noakhali. It is used as the [[lingua franca]] among the Indians of South Tripura District and it is also widely spoken in Gomati District and Sepahijala District of Tripura. The Noakhailla dialect is also understood and spoken by indigenous Tripuri Tribes and also Chakma, Mog (Marma), Reang etc. It is widely spoken in: Belonia, Manurmukh, Sabroom, Santirbazar, Joalibari, Baikhora, Kathalia, Barpathari, Trishna, Chandrapur, Garjee, Hrishyamukh, Satchand, Karbook, Natunbazar, Birchandra Manu, Rajnagar etc. Belonia is the Headquarters of South Tripura District which consists of three subdivisions namely Belonia, Santirbazar and Sabroom.\n\nThe Noakhailla dialect does not have any recognised grammar recording. There is no formal use of the Noakhailla dialect in public, in courts, or in the legislature like the existent standard Bangla. It remains as the language of the people of the Greater Noakhali region of Bangladesh. The educated, elite, political and influential groups of Bangladesh bearing Noakhali homogeneity, or being intrinsically exposed to the socio-cultural phenomenon of Noakhali, usually prefer the standard form of Bangla for their wider communication. They keep this dialect as their private means of communication only with members of the indigenous community of Greater Noakhali. This dialect is very famous in Bangladesh. A lot of Bangladeshi dramas are written in this dialect, so Bangladeshi actors actress are busy learning it.\n\n===Education===\nThe literacy rate of Noakhali district is 69.57% (male- 72.40% and female- 67.60%). School attendance rate is 74.40% for the five to 24 years age group.<ref name=\"District Statistics 2011,Noakhali\"/>\n\nIn Noakhali there are 1,243 Primary Schools (Government: 776, Non-government: 329, Community: 76, Satellite: 62), 289 High Schools, 161 Madrashas (Senior Madrasha: 30, Dakhil and Alim Madrasha: 131), five Technical Institutions (Youth Training Center: two, PTI: one Technical School and College: two, 35 Colleges (Government: eight, Private: 27), one Medical Assistant Training School (MATS), one Agricultural Training Institute, one Government Medical College, one Homeopathic Medical College, one Textile Engineering College and one Science and Technology University.\n\n===History of Education System===\nThe quality of the education system in this district is commendable. But it is necessary to look back at what the education system was like before. At the beginning of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[British rule]], the education system was generally dependent on \u2018tol\u2019 schools and maktabs. These taught Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit. However, the education system gradually improved and the Minor School was established. There was only one English high school in the year of 1857. There were 69 students. In the next four years, the number of students stood at 71. But in the year 1871, the students' number reach number at 596, as well as the number of government and aided schools reached 26. In the survey of 1872, there were 74.66% of the Muslim population but their literacy rate was only 20% of the total population at that time. However, the literacy rate of Muslims increased very significantly in the next decade. The total number of schools was 2775 in the year 1895. At that time, some changes in education policy closed many schools, so the number of schools dropped to 1330 in the year of 1898. The number of students in this district was more than 12,000 in the year. Let's talk about high schools. In Noakhali, there were only five English high schools in 1905. Among them were [[Noakhali Zilla School]], which was established in 1850 and was included as a Zilla School in 1853, Feni High School ( now [[Feni Government Pilot High School]]) which was established in 1886, Lakshmipur High School(now [[Lakshmipur Adarsha Samad Government High School]]) which was established in 1889, Sandwip Kargil High School now [[Kargil Government High School]] (1902). Since then, educational institutes have increased a lot until 1950. In the year of 1914, there were 5 more high schools were established in this district. They are [[Arun Chandra High School]] which was founded by the Bhulua Zamindar called Arun Chandra Singh Bahadur, Rajganj Union High School which was founded by Syed Sultan Alam Chowdhury and Rajgonj Banik family, Noakhali Ahmadiya High School, Begumganj High School and Khilpara High School which was situated at Ramganj Police Station. The number of high schools reached around 60 in the middle of the twentieth century. However, there was no other college besides [[Feni Government College]], which was founded in 1922. So Chaumuhani College was established in 1943, laying the foundation by Dr. Magnad Saha. This college is now known as [[Chowmuhani Government S.A College]]. SA College was named after the heroic freedom fighter, Saleh Ahmed. On the other hand, [[Noakhali Government College]] was established in 1963, [[Noakhali Government Women's College]] in 1970, [[Noakhali Science and Technology University]] in 2005 and [[Abdul Malek Ukil Medical College, Noakhali]] was established in 2008. From then till today the education system of this district has reached the threshold of improvement.<ref>Webster, J.E.(1911). Noakhali District Gazetteers.

Agriculture plays a vital role in the regional economy. 30% of the regional GDP comes from agriculture with 45% of the population employed in the sector {{fact|date=March 2019}}. Employment in the fishing industry is also dominant in the poorer sectors of the population. Annually, 15%\u201320% of labour is involved in this sector (boating, fishing, drying, net and boat making and repairing, transporting fish from one location to other). Poorer communities are involved in crop production during the winter but in other periods they are involved in fishing, either working for themselves or selling their labour to the mohajan. Around 40% {{fact|date=March 2019}} of the population works abroad playing a vital role in the national economy.\nThe main sources of income dependent on non-agricultural labour 3.43%, industry 0.84%, commerce 14.74%, transport and communication 3.83%, service 16.11%, construction 1.49%, religious service 0.39%, rent and remittance 7.97% and others 10.58%.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n===Agriculture===\nThe economy of Noakhali is predominately agriculture.

Various fruits like mango, banana, jack fruit, papaya, litchi, palm coconut and betel nut are grown.\n\nFish of different varieties are found here in the sea and rivers and paddy fields in the rainy season. Fishes like ruhi, katla, mrigel, kala baush, koi, grass carp, silver carp, talapia, nilotica and different species of local deshi fishes have also been introduced for commercial [[pisciculture]] (fish farming) in ponds and waterlands.\n\nTimber and forest trees are grown in this district including: koroi, sheel koroi, garjan, jarul, shimul, mahagonny, bamboo etc.\n\n==Transport==\nNoakhali district is connected by road, railway and waterway.\n\n'''Airport'''\n\nThe Bangladesh government has declared the constitution of an airport in [[Noakhali Sadar Upazila]] which is [[Maijdee]]\n\n'''Road'''\n\nNoakhali is well connected with the Bangladeshi capital city of [[Dhaka]] and the port city of Chittagong. By road the distance between Dhaka and Noakhali is {{cvt|151|km}}. The distances from Chittagong and Comilla are {{cvt|134|km}} and {{cvt|95|km}} respectively. Buses are the most common form of transport and run to a wide range of destinations within and outside the district. A number of independent transport companies operate buses, trucks and other vehicles from different parts of Noakhali to Feni, Chandpur, Comilla, Dhaka and Chittagong. Trucks carry the majority of goods transported in the district.\n\n'''Rail'''\n\nInter-City train the \"Upakul Express\" and Mail train \"Noakhali Express\" operate between Noakhali station and [[Kamalapur Railway Station]] in Dhaka. The local train that operates between Noakhali station and [[Laksam Railway Junction]] of Comilla stops at seven railway stations in Noakhali District\u2014Noakhali (Sonapur), Harinarayanpur, Maijdee Court, Maijdee, Chowmuhani, Bazra and Sonaimuri.\n\n'''Water transport'''\n\nThe Southern part of the Noakhali District and Hatiya Upazila is well connected by water transport. Hatiya island is isolated from the mainland but is accessible from Noakhali by sea-truck, from Chittagong by steamer, and from Dhaka by launch.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n\n'''Flora'''\n\nNoakhali is one of the coastal districts at the fringe of the Bay of Bengal with vast char land of recent origin in the south. Plant life is confined generally to variations belonging to the lower gangetic plane and of other districts in the southern region of the country. Except for the Government sponsored [[afforestation]] programme for the coastal belt, there is no organised forestry in the district.\n\nHowever, all homesteads are usually covered by dense and lush green foliage of a wide variety of trees. Most of the trees grown in homestead forests are fruitbearing. Mangoes, although poor in quality, grow in abundance. Almond or badam (''Arachis hypogea'') are unusual. Other common trees are jack fruit (''Artocarpus heterophyllus''), black berry (''Syzygium cumini''), tamarind (''Tamarindus indica''), jalpai (''Elaeocarpus tectorius''), bel (''Aegle marmelos''), chalta (''Dillenia indica''), boroi, guava (''Psidiumguagava''), etc. Banana (''Banana musa sapientum'') is seen almost everywhere but the fruit quality is rather poor.\n\nLitchi (''Litchi chinensis''), kamranga (''Averrho karmbola''), ata, haritaki (''Terminalia chebula''), amloki (''Phyllanthus emblica''), gaab (''Dioaspyros precatorius''), etc. grow abundantly. The juice of the gaab fruit mixed with charcoal is used in colouring boats and stiffening fishing nets. Coconut (''Cocos nucifera'') is abundantly produced in Noakhali.\n\nIndigenous timber trees include Koroi, sheel koroi (''Albizia procera''), garjan (''Dipterocarpus turbinatus''), jarul (''Iegerstroemia speciosa''), shimul (''Bombax ceiba''), etc. However, various exotic trees like teak, mahogany (''Swietenia macrophylla''), sissu (''Dalbergia sissoo''), etc. have been produced as wayside trees as well as in farm forestry.\n\nMandar (''Erythrina variegata''), a thorny tree mostly used as fuel and fencing, is seen in almost every household forest. Kadom (''Anthocephalus cadamba'') are very common and are preferred for manufacturing matchsticks. The fruit of shimul or karpas is used for stuffing mattresses and pillows and has a silky appearance. Newly introduced trees include eucalyptus and pine.\n\nMango wood is not good as a timber, but owing to its abundance, it is much used. The wood of the tamarind and the kul is hard-grained and of good quality. The amaltas is used for house and rough furniture construction. Jarul is used for boat building and pillars of houses.\n\nThe luxuriant growth of palms is the most characteristic feature of the vegetation. Betel nut palm or supari (''Areca catechu'') plantations are more and more abundant towards the north and the west of the district and grow almost lie forests. Coconut are grown abundantly throughout the district. Toddy palms or tal (''Borassus flabellifer'') and date palms or khejur are also very common. Date palm is a valuable tree. The juice is extracted and made into gurr, the leaves are made into mat. Tal wood is used for posts of houses and other building purposes. Its leaves are used for making handmade mats and large hand fans. Betel nut and coconut are a good source of household income.\n\nShade trees include banyan or bot (''Ficus benghalensis''), pipal (''Ficus religiosa'') and nim (''Azadirachta indica'') and are seen commonly.\n\nThere are several varieties of cane, a good deal of bamboo of different varieties, and thatching grass or chhan although their plantations are gradually but steadliy decreasing. Use of bamboo is widespread for posts and fencing for houses, basket making and producing trays of various kinds. Bet is used for making baskets, binding and thatching. In the marshes are found sola (''Aeschynomene aspera'') and murta or mostak (''Schumannianthus dichotomus '') which is extensively used for making various types of mats famously known as ''shital pati'' and baskets.\n\nThe forest department of the government of Bangladesh created mangrove forests in [[Nijhum Dwip]]. The most common type of planted tree species on the island is keora, also known as kerfa, which has fast growing roots holding the sandy land. The tree occurs on newly accreted soil in moderately to strongly saline areas and is considered as a pioneer species in ecological succession.\n\n'''Fauna'''\n\nOwing to the absence of organised forest and other natural conditions, no large or medium-sized carnivores are seen in the district. However, the following mammals are still seen the district although their number is gradually decreasing: jackal (''Canis aureus''), fox (''Vulpes bengalensis''), large Indian civet or bagdas (''Viverra zibetha''), otter or uud (''Lutra lutra''), lrrawaddy, kath biral (''Callosciuruspy gerythrus''), Bengal mongoose or beji (''Herpestes edwards''), different kinds of rats and several species of bats.\n\nBuffalo is found in char and on Hatia island. The vast offshore areas and the emerging islands of the Noakhali district have become  potential places for raising buffalo.\n\nAlmost all varieties of birds that are seen throughout Bangladesh are also commonly seen in Noakhali. Raptors include: white-rumped vulture (''Gyps bengalensis''), lanner falcon or baj (''Falco biarmicus''), marsh harrier or gochila (''Circus aeruginesus''), pariah cheel (''Milvus migyans lineatas''), several species of stork like pond heron or kani boga (''Ardeola greyii''), cattle egret or go boga (''Babulcus ibis'') and black bittern or kala boga (''Dupeter plovicollis''), crows (''Corvus splendens'') and kingfisher (''Alcedo atthis''), etc.\n\nDucks are represented by a number of species including winter migrants like: greenleg goose (''Anser anser''), rajhans (''Anser indicus''), the pintail (''Anas acuta'') and some other domestic species. Water birds include: the little cormorant or pankawri (''Phalacrocorax niger''), waterhen or dahuk (''Amaurornis phonicurus''), kora (''Gallicrex cinarea'').\n\nCuckoo or kokil (''Cuculus micropterus''), black-hooded oriole or halde pakhi (''Oriolus xanthornus''), kingcrow or finge (''Dicrurus adsimilis''), moyna (''Sturnus malabarica''), shalik (''Acridotheres tristis''), redvented bulbuli (''Pycnotus cafer''), tuntuni (''Orthotomus sutorious''), shayma (''Copsyehus malabaricus''), sparrow (''Passer domesticus''), flowerpecker (''Dicacum erythrochynchos''), babui (''Plocus phillippinus'') famous for their artistic nest building, and several species of pheasant quails (''Eudynamis scolopscea''), pigeons and doves are also present.\n\nReptiles include snakes, lizards and tortoises. The snakes include varieties of cobra, urgabora, dughadabora, kuchiabora and jinlabora, all poisonous. The lizards include gecko, calotis, wall lizard and monitor lizard. There are amphibnians like toads, frogs and tree frogs.\n\nThere are many species of sea and fresh water fish available in the district. The list of the varieties is too long to include here. Although Noakhali is coastal district, most of the fish supply comes from ponds and tanks, canals and low-lying areas inundated by rain water, popular varieties include: the carp tribe (''Cyprinidoes''), Ruhi (''Labeo rohita''), Katla (''Catla catla''), Mrigel (''Cirrhinus mrigala'') and Kalabaush (''labeo calbasu''), Airh (''Sperata aor''), Pangas (''Pangasius pangasius''), Tengra (''Mystus vittatus'') of several types, Magur (''Clarias batrschus''), Singi (''Saccobranchus fossilis'') and Koi(''Mystus vittatus'') are considered to be delicious, Shoul (''Channa striatus''), Boal (''Wallago attu''), Gozar (''Channa marulius''), Chitol (''Chitala chitala''), Foli (''Notopterus notopterus'') and Pabda (''Ompok pabda'') are available in abundance.\n\nHilsa (''Tenualosa ilisha''), Baila (''Awaous guamensis''), Bhetki (''Lates calcarifer''), Bata (''Labeo bata''), loitta etc. fish are also available in abundance.\n\nPrawn, crayfish (''icha'') and crabs are also found. Tilapia, Muralla, Punti, Khoksha, Kajuli, Kakila, Khailsha, Bain and Chela are small fish like Mola, Kachki are found all over the district in abundance.\n\nCreated mangrove forests in Nijhum Dwip are the habitat of about 5,000 cheetral or spotted deer. This island has been declared as a unique eco-tourist spot for its ideal natural setup with rich bio-diversification factors and its perennial mangrove forest with wild animals like spotted deer, wild boar and rhesus macaque and for the ideal habitat for fish resources.\n\n==Places of interest==\n\n===Nijhum Dwip===\n[[File:Nijhum Dwip (03).jpg|thumb|Nijhum Dwip (03)]]\n[[Nijhum Dwip]] (Char Osmani, Baluar Char, Golden Island )<ref>Abdul Aouwal, [http://www.ontaheen.com/nijhum-dwip-national-park-bangladesh/ \"Nijhum Dwip National Park Bangladesh\"], ''Ontaheen'', 16 June 2016 2:50&nbsp;pm</ref> is a small island under Hatiya upazila of Noakhali. A cluster of islands (mainly, Ballar Char, Kamlar Char, Char Osman and Char Muri) emerged in the early 1950s as alluvium in the shallow estuary of the Bay of Bengal on the south of Noakhali. These new sandbanks first drew the attention of a group of fishermen, who named it Baular Char. In 1974 the Forest Department began an aforestation program for twenty years on the north side of the island. Covering an area of {{cvt|9000|acre}}, it has now developed into a deep forest with a variety of plant species. Among the trees Keora is often seen. Besides this Gewa, Kankra, Bain, Babul, Karamja, Pashur and many other species are in evidence. It was renamed 'Nijhum Dweep' by former Minister Amirul Islam Kalam in 1979 after observing its isolation and mild nature.\n\nDuring winter thousands of migratory birds flock to the island. The fishermen use the airy and sunny land as an ideal place for drying their catches from the sea. Sometimes they construct straw huts on the island as seasonal residences.\n\nOn 8 April 2001 the government declared the {{cvt|40,390|acre}} of forest of the Jahajmara range including {{cvt|9,550|acre}} of forest land on Nijhum Dweep as a national park to protect the development of the biodiversity of the forest.\n\n===Bazra Shahi Mosque===\n[[File:Noakhali BojraShahi MG 3913.jpg|thumb|Bojra Shahi Mosque, Noakhali]]\nBazra Shahi Mosque is one of the major archaeological works in undivided Bengal. It is situated {{cvt|8|miles|spell=on}} from district headquarter Maijdee Court. Amir Sanaullah, the owner of Bazra Jaigir started the construction of the Bazra'Shahi Mosque in the pattern of Tajmahal in the Hizri year 1134. The construction was completed in the Hizri year 1154. The Bazra Shahi Mosque is an example of Moghal architecture. In the year 1922, Ali Ahmed, the Jaminder of Bazra, plastered the whole exterior of the mosque with China clay.\n\n===Queen Lurther's Catholic Church===\nThis is one of the oldest Catholic churches in the country. It was established in 1959, and named after the Queen Lurther at Sonapur of Noakhali Sadar upazila. Its quiet, bland shadowed environment made the Church glamorous. A Christian cemetery containing numerous crosses, a giant statue of Jesus Christ, a flower garden, spectacular ponds,a  mission school, a charitable health center, and a crafts center are also seen beside the Church. Around the Church there is a large Christian colony.\n\nChristians in this district had Portuguese ancestry. The Portuguese pirates of Sandwip terrorised the coasts of Noakhali throughout the seventeenth century.<ref>{{citation |last=Danvers|first=F. C.|authorlink=Frederic Charles Danvers |title= The Portuguese in India}}</ref> Later on they inter-married with the women of the region. In 1844 the first Christian missionary arrived in Noakhali.\n\nThe mission maintains two boys' schools and one girls' school at Noakhali and one girls' school at Ewazbalia. It makes few converts.<ref name=\"The Pioneer Press\"/>\n\n===Gandhi Ashram===\nThe establishment of Gandhi Ashram trust is rooted with the Peace Mission of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] immediately after the communal riots in 1946 at Noakhali. Gandhi stayed for about four months in the riot-stricken areas. He started moving around the villages and motivated the people towards his peaceful coexistence and non-violence philosophy. When Gandhiji came to Jayag on 29 January 1947 all sections of the local community extended him whole-hearten support. At that time, Barrister Hemanta Kumar Ghosh of the village donated all his resources to Mahatma for the development and peace of the area and [[Gandhi Ashram Trust|Ambika Kaliganga Charitable Trust]] was formed.

The area is influenced by diurnal tidal cycles; the tidal fluctuations vary depending on seasons, and are most pronounced during the monsoon season.\nOn three sides of Noakhali an [[alluvial plain]] that is inundated annually and fertilised by [[silt]] deposits from the Meghna estuary. The swift currents that course down from the [[Himalayas]] carry rich fertile silt. When it reaches the Bay of Bengal the silt settles along the coast gradually forming new land called the \"chars\".

It was part of [[Pundra Kingdom]]. \n\nIn the 1660s, the agricultural activities of the north-eastern region of Bhulua were seriously affected by floodwaters of the [[Dakatia River]] flowing from the [[Tripura]] hills. To salvage the situation, a canal was dug in 1660 that ran from the Dakatia through Ramganj, Sonaimuri and Chaumuhani to divert water flow to the junction of the [[Meghna River]] and [[Feni River|Feni]]. After excavating this long canal, Bhulua began to be known as \"Noakhali\". The name \"Noakhali\" originated from the terms \"Noa\" (New) and \"Khal\" (Canal).\n\nTwo hundred years ago Noakhali district was known as Bhulua Pargana. South Shahbazpur(Bhola), Lakshmipur, the mainland of Noakhali district and a portion of the present Feni district were included in the Bhulua Pargana. In 1821 Mr. Plyden, a salt agent, was the additional position of [[collectorate]] (district judge) of Bhulua by the governor general. He proposed to the governor general to establish a new district when some administrative problems arose with other Bhulua salt-agents. On 29 March 1822 the Governor General passed an order in this regard and accordingly a new district was constituted with: South Shabajpur,  Sudharam,  Begumganj,  Ramganj, Raipur, Lakshmipur,  Feni, Parshuram, Elahabad Pargana of Tippera and Hatia, Sandwhip and Bamni of Chittagong district. The district was named Noakhali in 1868.\nIn 1876 Noakhali district was divided into two sub-divisions.  Feni Sub-division was constituted with: Chhagalnaiya thana of Tippera, Mirshari of Chittagong, Feni Pargana, Parshuram and Sonagazi. Sadar Sub-division was formed with the remaining areas. In the 1901 census its area was {{cvt|1,644|mi2}} and its population was about 1,141,728.<ref name=\"The Pioneer Press\">{{cite book|last1= Webster|first1=J.E|title=Eastern Bengal and Assam District Gazetteers:Noakhali.|date=1911|publisher=The Pioneer Press|location= Allahbad|isbn= |url=https://archive.org/details/noakhali00webs}}</ref>\n[[Noakhali riots|Regional violence in 1946]] escalated communal tensions throughout [[British Raj|British India]] just before the [[Partition of India|1947 partition]]. One of the worst religious massacres and incidents of ethnic cleansing against the  Hindu community took place in Noakhali during the 1946 riot known as the [[Noakhali genocide]]. A huge number of mass killing, raping, looting, and forcible conversions took place. The prime minister of Bengal, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, answering a question from [[Dhirendranath Datta]] in the assembly early in 1947 stated that there had been 9,895 cases of forcible conversion in Tipperah alone.

These chairmen are the dominant and voting members of the Parishad (counseling body) apart from various Upazila-level functionaries representing respective district counterparts.\n\n'''Deputy Commissioner (DC):''' Tanmaya Das <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mopa.gov.bd/en/home/officer/115 |title=List of Deputy Commissioners |website=Ministry of Public Administration |access-date=11 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214224737/http://www.mopa.gov.bd/en/home/officer/115 |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Administrator of Zila Parishad:''' ABM Zaforullah<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=214399 |title=AL men appointed administrators |website=The Daily Star |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701090205/http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=214399 |archive-date=1 July 2015 |url-status=dead |access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative subdivisions==\nNoakhali District consists of: nine upazilas, eight municipalities, 72 wards, 153 mahallas, 91 unions, 882 mouzas and 967 villages.\n\n===Upazilas===\nNoakhali District is divided into the following Sub-districts (Upazilas):\n# [[Senbagh Upazila]]\n# [[Begumganj Upazila]]\n# [[Chatkhil Upazila]]\n# [[Companiganj Upazila, Noakhali|Companiganj Upazila]]\n# [[Noakhali Sadar Upazila]]\n# [[Hatiya Upazila]]\n# [[Kabirhat Upazila]]\n# [[Sonaimuri Upazila]]\n# [[Suborno Char Upazila]]\n\n===Municipalities===\nA municipality is usually an urban administrative division having corporate status and usually powers of self-government or jurisdiction.

It is not only spoken by the people of Noakhal but also the people of [[Feni District|Feni]] and [[Lakshmipur District|Lakshmipur]] as well as southern parts of the district of [[Comilla]],  [[Mirsharai Upazila]], [[Sandwip]] of [[Chittagong]]<nowiki/>district, [[Haziganj Upazila]] of [[Chadpur]] district.  Indian nationals of [[Tripura]] state also speak the dialect of Noakhali. It is used as the [[lingua franca]] among the Indians of South Tripura District and it is also widely spoken in Gomati District and Sepahijala District of Tripura. The Noakhailla dialect is also understood and spoken by indigenous Tripuri Tribes and also Chakma, Mog (Marma), Reang etc. It is widely spoken in: Belonia, Manurmukh, Sabroom, Santirbazar, Joalibari, Baikhora, Kathalia, Barpathari, Trishna, Chandrapur, Garjee, Hrishyamukh, Satchand, Karbook, Natunbazar, Birchandra Manu, Rajnagar etc. Belonia is the Headquarters of South Tripura District which consists of three subdivisions namely Belonia, Santirbazar and Sabroom.\n\nThe Noakhailla dialect does not have any recognised grammar recording. There is no formal use of the Noakhailla dialect in public, in courts, or in the legislature like the existent standard Bangla. It remains as the language of the people of the Greater Noakhali region of Bangladesh. The educated, elite, political and influential groups of Bangladesh bearing Noakhali homogeneity, or being intrinsically exposed to the socio-cultural phenomenon of Noakhali, usually prefer the standard form of Bangla for their wider communication. They keep this dialect as their private means of communication only with members of the indigenous community of Greater Noakhali. This dialect is very famous in Bangladesh. A lot of Bangladeshi dramas are written in this dialect, so Bangladeshi actors actress are busy learning it.\n\n===Education===\nThe literacy rate of Noakhali district is 69.57% (male- 72.40% and female- 67.60%). School attendance rate is 74.40% for the five to 24 years age group.<ref name=\"District Statistics 2011,Noakhali\"/>\n\nIn Noakhali there are 1,243 Primary Schools (Government: 776, Non-government: 329, Community: 76, Satellite: 62), 289 High Schools, 161 Madrashas (Senior Madrasha: 30, Dakhil and Alim Madrasha: 131), five Technical Institutions (Youth Training Center: two, PTI: one Technical School and College: two, 35 Colleges (Government: eight, Private: 27), one Medical Assistant Training School (MATS), one Agricultural Training Institute, one Government Medical College, one Homeopathic Medical College, one Textile Engineering College and one Science and Technology University.\n\n===History of Education System===\nThe quality of the education system in this district is commendable. But it is necessary to look back at what the education system was like before. At the beginning of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[British rule]], the education system was generally dependent on \u2018tol\u2019 schools and maktabs. These taught Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit. However, the education system gradually improved and the Minor School was established. There was only one English high school in the year of 1857. There were 69 students. In the next four years, the number of students stood at 71. But in the year 1871, the students' number reach number at 596, as well as the number of government and aided schools reached 26. In the survey of 1872, there were 74.66% of the Muslim population but their literacy rate was only 20% of the total population at that time. However, the literacy rate of Muslims increased very significantly in the next decade. The total number of schools was 2775 in the year 1895. At that time, some changes in education policy closed many schools, so the number of schools dropped to 1330 in the year of 1898. The number of students in this district was more than 12,000 in the year. Let's talk about high schools. In Noakhali, there were only five English high schools in 1905. Among them were [[Noakhali Zilla School]], which was established in 1850 and was included as a Zilla School in 1853, Feni High School ( now [[Feni Government Pilot High School]]) which was established in 1886, Lakshmipur High School(now [[Lakshmipur Adarsha Samad Government High School]]) which was established in 1889, Sandwip Kargil High School now [[Kargil Government High School]] (1902). Since then, educational institutes have increased a lot until 1950. In the year of 1914, there were 5 more high schools were established in this district. They are [[Arun Chandra High School]] which was founded by the Bhulua Zamindar called Arun Chandra Singh Bahadur, Rajganj Union High School which was founded by Syed Sultan Alam Chowdhury and Rajgonj Banik family, Noakhali Ahmadiya High School, Begumganj High School and Khilpara High School which was situated at Ramganj Police Station. The number of high schools reached around 60 in the middle of the twentieth century. However, there was no other college besides [[Feni Government College]], which was founded in 1922. So Chaumuhani College was established in 1943, laying the foundation by Dr. Magnad Saha. This college is now known as [[Chowmuhani Government S.A College]]. SA College was named after the heroic freedom fighter, Saleh Ahmed. On the other hand, [[Noakhali Government College]] was established in 1963, [[Noakhali Government Women's College]] in 1970, [[Noakhali Science and Technology University]] in 2005 and [[Abdul Malek Ukil Medical College, Noakhali]] was established in 2008. From then till today the education system of this district has reached the threshold of improvement.<ref>Webster, J.E.(1911). Noakhali District Gazetteers.

Agriculture plays a vital role in the regional economy. 30% of the regional GDP comes from agriculture with 45% of the population employed in the sector {{fact|date=March 2019}}. Employment in the fishing industry is also dominant in the poorer sectors of the population. Annually, 15%\u201320% of labour is involved in this sector (boating, fishing, drying, net and boat making and repairing, transporting fish from one location to other). Poorer communities are involved in crop production during the winter but in other periods they are involved in fishing, either working for themselves or selling their labour to the mohajan. Around 40% {{fact|date=March 2019}} of the population works abroad playing a vital role in the national economy.\nThe main sources of income dependent on non-agricultural labour 3.43%, industry 0.84%, commerce 14.74%, transport and communication 3.83%, service 16.11%, construction 1.49%, religious service 0.39%, rent and remittance 7.97% and others 10.58%.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n===Agriculture===\nThe economy of Noakhali is predominately agriculture.

Various fruits like mango, banana, jack fruit, papaya, litchi, palm coconut and betel nut are grown.\n\nFish of different varieties are found here in the sea and rivers and paddy fields in the rainy season. Fishes like ruhi, katla, mrigel, kala baush, koi, grass carp, silver carp, talapia, nilotica and different species of local deshi fishes have also been introduced for commercial [[pisciculture]] (fish farming) in ponds and waterlands.\n\nTimber and forest trees are grown in this district including: koroi, sheel koroi, garjan, jarul, shimul, mahagonny, bamboo etc.\n\n==Transport==\nNoakhali district is connected by road, railway and waterway.\n\n'''Airport'''\n\nThe Bangladesh government has declared the constitution of an airport in [[Noakhali Sadar Upazila]] which is [[Maijdee]]\n\n'''Road'''\n\nNoakhali is well connected with the Bangladeshi capital city of [[Dhaka]] and the port city of Chittagong. By road the distance between Dhaka and Noakhali is {{cvt|151|km}}. The distances from Chittagong and Comilla are {{cvt|134|km}} and {{cvt|95|km}} respectively. Buses are the most common form of transport and run to a wide range of destinations within and outside the district. A number of independent transport companies operate buses, trucks and other vehicles from different parts of Noakhali to Feni, Chandpur, Comilla, Dhaka and Chittagong. Trucks carry the majority of goods transported in the district.\n\n'''Rail'''\n\nInter-City train the \"Upakul Express\" and Mail train \"Noakhali Express\" operate between Noakhali station and [[Kamalapur Railway Station]] in Dhaka. The local train that operates between Noakhali station and [[Laksam Railway Junction]] of Comilla stops at seven railway stations in Noakhali District\u2014Noakhali (Sonapur), Harinarayanpur, Maijdee Court, Maijdee, Chowmuhani, Bazra and Sonaimuri.\n\n'''Water transport'''\n\nThe Southern part of the Noakhali District and Hatiya Upazila is well connected by water transport. Hatiya island is isolated from the mainland but is accessible from Noakhali by sea-truck, from Chittagong by steamer, and from Dhaka by launch.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n\n'''Flora'''\n\nNoakhali is one of the coastal districts at the fringe of the Bay of Bengal with vast char land of recent origin in the south. Plant life is confined generally to variations belonging to the lower gangetic plane and of other districts in the southern region of the country. Except for the Government sponsored [[afforestation]] programme for the coastal belt, there is no organised forestry in the district.\n\nHowever, all homesteads are usually covered by dense and lush green foliage of a wide variety of trees. Most of the trees grown in homestead forests are fruitbearing. Mangoes, although poor in quality, grow in abundance. Almond or badam (''Arachis hypogea'') are unusual. Other common trees are jack fruit (''Artocarpus heterophyllus''), black berry (''Syzygium cumini''), tamarind (''Tamarindus indica''), jalpai (''Elaeocarpus tectorius''), bel (''Aegle marmelos''), chalta (''Dillenia indica''), boroi, guava (''Psidiumguagava''), etc. Banana (''Banana musa sapientum'') is seen almost everywhere but the fruit quality is rather poor.\n\nLitchi (''Litchi chinensis''), kamranga (''Averrho karmbola''), ata, haritaki (''Terminalia chebula''), amloki (''Phyllanthus emblica''), gaab (''Dioaspyros precatorius''), etc. grow abundantly. The juice of the gaab fruit mixed with charcoal is used in colouring boats and stiffening fishing nets. Coconut (''Cocos nucifera'') is abundantly produced in Noakhali.\n\nIndigenous timber trees include Koroi, sheel koroi (''Albizia procera''), garjan (''Dipterocarpus turbinatus''), jarul (''Iegerstroemia speciosa''), shimul (''Bombax ceiba''), etc. However, various exotic trees like teak, mahogany (''Swietenia macrophylla''), sissu (''Dalbergia sissoo''), etc. have been produced as wayside trees as well as in farm forestry.\n\nMandar (''Erythrina variegata''), a thorny tree mostly used as fuel and fencing, is seen in almost every household forest. Kadom (''Anthocephalus cadamba'') are very common and are preferred for manufacturing matchsticks. The fruit of shimul or karpas is used for stuffing mattresses and pillows and has a silky appearance. Newly introduced trees include eucalyptus and pine.\n\nMango wood is not good as a timber, but owing to its abundance, it is much used. The wood of the tamarind and the kul is hard-grained and of good quality. The amaltas is used for house and rough furniture construction. Jarul is used for boat building and pillars of houses.\n\nThe luxuriant growth of palms is the most characteristic feature of the vegetation. Betel nut palm or supari (''Areca catechu'') plantations are more and more abundant towards the north and the west of the district and grow almost lie forests. Coconut are grown abundantly throughout the district. Toddy palms or tal (''Borassus flabellifer'') and date palms or khejur are also very common. Date palm is a valuable tree. The juice is extracted and made into gurr, the leaves are made into mat. Tal wood is used for posts of houses and other building purposes. Its leaves are used for making handmade mats and large hand fans. Betel nut and coconut are a good source of household income.\n\nShade trees include banyan or bot (''Ficus benghalensis''), pipal (''Ficus religiosa'') and nim (''Azadirachta indica'') and are seen commonly.\n\nThere are several varieties of cane, a good deal of bamboo of different varieties, and thatching grass or chhan although their plantations are gradually but steadliy decreasing. Use of bamboo is widespread for posts and fencing for houses, basket making and producing trays of various kinds. Bet is used for making baskets, binding and thatching. In the marshes are found sola (''Aeschynomene aspera'') and murta or mostak (''Schumannianthus dichotomus '') which is extensively used for making various types of mats famously known as ''shital pati'' and baskets.\n\nThe forest department of the government of Bangladesh created mangrove forests in [[Nijhum Dwip]]. The most common type of planted tree species on the island is keora, also known as kerfa, which has fast growing roots holding the sandy land. The tree occurs on newly accreted soil in moderately to strongly saline areas and is considered as a pioneer species in ecological succession.\n\n'''Fauna'''\n\nOwing to the absence of organised forest and other natural conditions, no large or medium-sized carnivores are seen in the district. However, the following mammals are still seen the district although their number is gradually decreasing: jackal (''Canis aureus''), fox (''Vulpes bengalensis''), large Indian civet or bagdas (''Viverra zibetha''), otter or uud (''Lutra lutra''), lrrawaddy, kath biral (''Callosciuruspy gerythrus''), Bengal mongoose or beji (''Herpestes edwards''), different kinds of rats and several species of bats.\n\nBuffalo is found in char and on Hatia island. The vast offshore areas and the emerging islands of the Noakhali district have become  potential places for raising buffalo.\n\nAlmost all varieties of birds that are seen throughout Bangladesh are also commonly seen in Noakhali. Raptors include: white-rumped vulture (''Gyps bengalensis''), lanner falcon or baj (''Falco biarmicus''), marsh harrier or gochila (''Circus aeruginesus''), pariah cheel (''Milvus migyans lineatas''), several species of stork like pond heron or kani boga (''Ardeola greyii''), cattle egret or go boga (''Babulcus ibis'') and black bittern or kala boga (''Dupeter plovicollis''), crows (''Corvus splendens'') and kingfisher (''Alcedo atthis''), etc.\n\nDucks are represented by a number of species including winter migrants like: greenleg goose (''Anser anser''), rajhans (''Anser indicus''), the pintail (''Anas acuta'') and some other domestic species. Water birds include: the little cormorant or pankawri (''Phalacrocorax niger''), waterhen or dahuk (''Amaurornis phonicurus''), kora (''Gallicrex cinarea'').\n\nCuckoo or kokil (''Cuculus micropterus''), black-hooded oriole or halde pakhi (''Oriolus xanthornus''), kingcrow or finge (''Dicrurus adsimilis''), moyna (''Sturnus malabarica''), shalik (''Acridotheres tristis''), redvented bulbuli (''Pycnotus cafer''), tuntuni (''Orthotomus sutorious''), shayma (''Copsyehus malabaricus''), sparrow (''Passer domesticus''), flowerpecker (''Dicacum erythrochynchos''), babui (''Plocus phillippinus'') famous for their artistic nest building, and several species of pheasant quails (''Eudynamis scolopscea''), pigeons and doves are also present.\n\nReptiles include snakes, lizards and tortoises.

A cluster of islands (mainly, Ballar Char, Kamlar Char, Char Osman and Char Muri) emerged in the early 1950s as alluvium in the shallow estuary of the Bay of Bengal on the south of Noakhali. These new sandbanks first drew the attention of a group of fishermen, who named it Baular Char. In 1974 the Forest Department began an aforestation program for twenty years on the north side of the island. Covering an area of {{cvt|9000|acre}}, it has now developed into a deep forest with a variety of plant species. Among the trees Keora is often seen. Besides this Gewa, Kankra, Bain, Babul, Karamja, Pashur and many other species are in evidence. It was renamed 'Nijhum Dweep' by former Minister Amirul Islam Kalam in 1979 after observing its isolation and mild nature.\n\nDuring winter thousands of migratory birds flock to the island. The fishermen use the airy and sunny land as an ideal place for drying their catches from the sea. Sometimes they construct straw huts on the island as seasonal residences.\n\nOn 8 April 2001 the government declared the {{cvt|40,390|acre}} of forest of the Jahajmara range including {{cvt|9,550|acre}} of forest land on Nijhum Dweep as a national park to protect the development of the biodiversity of the forest.\n\n===Bazra Shahi Mosque===\n[[File:Noakhali BojraShahi MG 3913.jpg|thumb|Bojra Shahi Mosque, Noakhali]]\nBazra Shahi Mosque is one of the major archaeological works in undivided Bengal. It is situated {{cvt|8|miles|spell=on}} from district headquarter Maijdee Court. Amir Sanaullah, the owner of Bazra Jaigir started the construction of the Bazra'Shahi Mosque in the pattern of Tajmahal in the Hizri year 1134. The construction was completed in the Hizri year 1154. The Bazra Shahi Mosque is an example of Moghal architecture. In the year 1922, Ali Ahmed, the Jaminder of Bazra, plastered the whole exterior of the mosque with China clay.\n\n===Queen Lurther's Catholic Church===\nThis is one of the oldest Catholic churches in the country. It was established in 1959, and named after the Queen Lurther at Sonapur of Noakhali Sadar upazila. Its quiet, bland shadowed environment made the Church glamorous. A Christian cemetery containing numerous crosses, a giant statue of Jesus Christ, a flower garden, spectacular ponds,a  mission school, a charitable health center, and a crafts center are also seen beside the Church. Around the Church there is a large Christian colony.\n\nChristians in this district had Portuguese ancestry. The Portuguese pirates of Sandwip terrorised the coasts of Noakhali throughout the seventeenth century.<ref>{{citation |last=Danvers|first=F. C.|authorlink=Frederic Charles Danvers |title= The Portuguese in India}}</ref> Later on they inter-married with the women of the region. In 1844 the first Christian missionary arrived in Noakhali.\n\nThe mission maintains two boys' schools and one girls' school at Noakhali and one girls' school at Ewazbalia. It makes few converts.<ref name=\"The Pioneer Press\"/>\n\n===Gandhi Ashram===\nThe establishment of Gandhi Ashram trust is rooted with the Peace Mission of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] immediately after the communal riots in 1946 at Noakhali. Gandhi stayed for about four months in the riot-stricken areas. He started moving around the villages and motivated the people towards his peaceful coexistence and non-violence philosophy. When Gandhiji came to Jayag on 29 January 1947 all sections of the local community extended him whole-hearten support. At that time, Barrister Hemanta Kumar Ghosh of the village donated all his resources to Mahatma for the development and peace of the area and [[Gandhi Ashram Trust|Ambika Kaliganga Charitable Trust]] was formed. The office of the Gandhi Peace Mission, formerly known as Gandhi Camp, was shifted to the present campus of Jayag, Sonaimuri.\n\n===Rajganj Mia Bari===\n[[File:Rajgonj Mia Bari.jpg|thumb|Rajgonj Mia Bari]]\nThis jomidar bari is known as [[Rajganj Mia Bari]].<ref> Tourist Places in Bangladesh https://www.touristplaces.com.bd/noakhali/rajgonj-mia-bari/</ref> It is located at Rajgonj union which is {{cvt|4|km|spell=on}} west of Maijdee Bazar. [[Sayed Sultan Alam Chowdhury]] built this house in 1907.\n\nA book titled ''Noakhalir Itihas'' was written by Sri Perimohan Sen, and mentioned the name of Syed Sultan Alam Chowdhury as a prestigious person of Noakhali. His ancestors came here from Baghdad on 5th Magh 1149 Bengali year. The first family member of this house named Syed Sher Alam Baghdadi. He came here only to preach Islam.\n\n===Musapur Closure===\n\nIt is located on the bank of the Feni river,in Companygonj upazila. The Musapur Closure Dam, which was constructed at a cost of Tk 194 crore at Musapur under Companiganj Upazila of the district, has ushered in a new prospect to the people living around it.\nThe dam was constructed applying workforce of around 6,000 labourers and is supposed to prevent salinity to about 1.30 lakh hectares of cropland under 14 upazilas in Noakhali, Comilla and Chandpur districts. However, a certain portion of the dam was washed away within three hours of its construction; later with the joint efforts of locals and the Water Development Board (WDB) here, the erosion could be prevented.\n\n== Notable residents ==\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n* [[Moudud Ahmed]], former prime minister of Bangladesh, was member of 8th Parliament for the Noakhali-5 constituency.\n* [[Moeen U Ahmed]], was the thirteenth chief of army staff of the Bangladesh Army from 15 June 2005 to 15 June 2009.
