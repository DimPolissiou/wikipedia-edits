The cast consisted of 11 twenty-something [[comedian]]s who created, acted, wrote, directed and edited the show. In various combinations, the former members of the State have continued to collaborate over the years, with alumni playing major creative, directing and acting roles in a number of notable projects including ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' and ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.\n\nSeveral memorable characters were created for the show, and for a short time their [[catchphrase]]s entered into the vernacular. Often, the cast would appear as themselves and address the audience to promote fake contests or to deliver mock public service announcements. Much like ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'', ''The State'''s sketches were sometimes linked to each other in some way: a punchline or image that ended one sketch often provided a lead-in to the next.\n\nAfter years of legal issues related to the [[soundtrack]] to many of the episodes, the series was released on [[DVD]] on July 14, 2009. A ''State'' film featuring all of the original troupe members was planned, but faced delays due to the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007\u20132008 screenwriters strike]], and the project never came to fruition.<ref>{{cite web|first=Silas|last=Lesnick|title=EXCLUSIVE: David Wain on The Ten and Future Comedies!|website=The Movie Reporter|url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4107&Itemid=99|date=January 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114052009/http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4107&Itemid=99|archivedate=January 14, 2009|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==About the show==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}\n''The State'' is not only the name of the television program, but also of the comedy troupe that made up the cast of the show, as they have continued to successfully work together on film, television and in the world of journalism in various groupings. A book, ''State by State With the State'', was published in April 1997 but is currently out of print. An album titled ''[[Comedy for Gracious Living]]'' was recorded for [[Warner Bros.]] but was shelved for unknown reasons. After being unearthed from the Warner vault, it was finally released in September 2010 by Rhino/Handmade via rhino.com. With liner notes written by the troupe, the packaging is notable for having, perhaps, the longest printed booklet ever included in a CD package.\n\nThe show's style of humor revolved mainly around the cast members' character acting and high energy, and featured a broad range of comedic styles from [[satire]] to forays into absurdism, although the absurdist element was not played up as much until the third season.  Notable examples include \"The Animal Song\" and \"The Howard Report\".  In addition, a common theme of the show's humor was to introduce a sketch with a \"straight man\" character caught in a ridiculous premise, then turn the sketch around by making the premise turn out to be correct.\n\nDespite being limited by having only one female member, [[Kerri Kenney]]'s energy and acting range (portraying anyone from an average housewife to [[Nancy Spungen]]) led the cast to describe her as \"the only girl we need\".  In sketches that called for more than one female role, Kenney would usually portray the character that needed to appear the most \"feminine\", and the other roles would go to male cast members who would wear [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. In a number of sketches with a female character, Kenney does not appear. During the \"James Dixon: Power Priest\" sketch, James weds a young couple in which the bride is played by [[Michael Ian Black]], and on the DVD commentary for this sketch, the cast jokes that \"this is another instance of 'why didn't Kerri play the girl?'\".  In one unaired sketch, \"Drag Dad\", Kenney actually played a male character, but it was done purposefully as part of the running joke of the sketch.\n\n\"Contrary to popular belief\", says the troupe's official [[FAQ]], \"the show was never canceled.\"<ref name=\"The State's official FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-state.com/faq.htm#5|title=The State's official FAQ|website=thestate.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007020447/http://www.the-state.com/faq.htm#5|archivedate=2012-10-07}}</ref> For a variety of reasons, including network television politics, ''The State'' decided to pursue other interests and \"establish ourselves as an entity that exists apart from any particular employer or TV Network.\"<ref name=\"The State's official FAQ\"/> However, [[CBS]] optioned to buy the show after its second year on MTV in hopes of increasing viewership among younger demographics and potentially providing competition against [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.  CBS intended to test the waters with ''The State's 43rd Annual All-Star Halloween Special'', which aired in prime time in 1995.  The special received generally good reviews (including some from critics that gave them harsh ones earlier), but due to little promotion, it received low ratings. The show was not picked up for further broadcasts.  On the series' DVD commentary, cast members revealed that MTV had offered a contract guarantee for 65 additional shows, but the cast turned it down to leave to CBS, against their agent's advice.\n\nThe entire cast was featured (or made a cameo) in 2007's [[David Wain]]-directed film, ''[[The Ten (film)|The Ten]]''. On March 15, 2008, most of the cast reunited for a special reunion sketch show at [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n=== ''The State'' DVD release ===\nA [[DVD]] release was expected by fans of the show. However, MTV remained reluctant to distribute the show until a complete DVD set was released in 2009.\n\nA leading factor that delayed the release was the use of popular songs as background music in the original broadcast versions of nearly every episode. ''The State'' was produced during a period when MTV had deals with various record labels, via which the network could easily use many songs that had a video aired on the network in their original programming without having to pay royalties to the labels; ''The State'' used popular music as the background music for countless sketches, utilizing hits like [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\", [[The Breeders]]' \"[[Cannonball (The Breeders song)|Cannonball]]\", [[Liz Phair]]'s \"Supernova\" and [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[Sexual Healing]]\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010814100624/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/4795/songs.html List of songs used in The State]</ref> Due to the large [[royalty fee]]s each company would likely demand, the soundtrack as originally aired would have cost many times the amount that video sales would recoup, so ''The State'' was forced to re-record much of the backing music with different, sometimes [[sound-alike]], songs.\n\nThe first season of ''The State'', digitally re-mastered along with a new musical score, was made available on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]\u2019s [[iTunes Store]] on September 26, 2006. Several episodes were also made available on [[Amazon Unbox]] as well as the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].\n\nOn March 10, 2007, David Wain announced at a screening of ''[[The Ten]]'' at [[SXSW]] that a DVD of ''The State'' was in production. At a later [[Philadelphia]] screening, he claimed it would be available in the fall of 2007. On May 18, 2007, during the 24-hour ''[[Human Giant]]'' marathon on MTV, [[Michael Showalter]] announced that a DVD set containing the entire series would be released by MTV sometime that year. He stated the set would contain every episode (some re-scored), commentaries, extras, and some sketches that never made it to the air.\n\nThe State's official website reported in November 2007 that the DVD set was completed, but that their distributor, MTV, has \"chosen not to release the set at this time. We don't know why.\"<ref name=\"The State's official news page\">[http://www.the-state.com/ The State's official news page].</ref>  On January 29, 2008, Showalter confirmed that MTV was still delaying the release: \"They have it. We've made the DVD, and it exists. It's out of our hands, and I know who has it, but I don't know why they're waiting... we've done the commentary and the deleted material and all that stuff, but I just don't know when it's coming out. \"<ref name=avshowalter/>\n\nIn 2009, some episodes of the series were made available in a free [[Streaming media|streaming]] format on the video website [[Joost]].<ref name=\"joost\">[[Joost]].com page for ''The State'': \"[http://www.joost.com/078u8gd/t/The-State-101#id=078u8gd Episode 1]\".</ref> As of mid-April 2009, three episodes were added to the site.\n\nIn an April 2009 interview with scifiwire.com, [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] reported a DVD release date of July 14, 2009, a date which was also verified on thestate.mtv.com.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schrodt |first=Paul |title=The State: Stupid-Brilliant Humor Returns on DVD |url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a6068/the-state-dvd-review-071609/ |website=Esquire |accessdate=February 27, 2020 |date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> To promote the release of the series on DVD, [[Comedy Central]], [[MTV]], and [[MTV2]] all aired select episodes of ''The State''.\n\n===Reviews===\n''[[The State]]'' received mixed reviews from critics during its original run.

The song is built around samples of [[The Nation of Ulysses]] songs \"The Kingdom of Heaven Must Be Taken By Storm\" (\"Boys and girls!\") and \"The Hickey Underworld\" (\"Action! Action!\").\n\n=== Recurring characters===\nThe cast (notably David Wain) have said that they were not interested in creating recurring characters, but were repeatedly pressured by the network to emulate ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in this manner. In turn, some of the recurring characters were made as satires of recurring characters (notably, \"Louie\" was made to satisfy network pressures for both a recurring character and catch-phrases, according to the casts' DVD commentary track).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| <center>Doug</center>\n| Played by [[Michael Showalter]]. A high school student and wannabe rebel who pointlessly struggles against surprisingly permissive and understanding authority figures. Doug's catchphrase is a wan \"I'm outta heeeerrre.\" A memorable sketch has Doug's father Don (Lennon) questioning him on his drug use. Doug replies \"Drugs?! Hey man, I'm Doug, not [[Bob Dylan]].\" His father asks him if he even knows who Bob Dylan is. Doug replies \"No...but I know he died of drugs.\" Doug's father then tells him Bob Dylan is alive and well, and that he in fact produced his last three albums, to which Doug replies, \"Oh, you mean Uncle Robert?\" He would often be followed by a group of friends (usually played by [[Ken Marino]], [[Kerri Kenney-Silver|Kerry Kenney]], [[Michael Patrick Jann]], and [[Joe Lo Truglio]]), who would inevitably find the authority figure cooler than Doug and decide to hang with them instead. Doug's father, Don, is played by [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and appears in the \"Doug\" sketches in 102, 204 and 305.\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Doug & Dad\", \"Captain Monterey Jack: Lights\", 103: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Shoes\", 106: \"Doug & Principal\", \"Captain Monterey Jack: Cheese\", 204: \"Doug III\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\", 305: \"Doug IV\"\n|-\n| <center>Louie</center>\n| Played by [[Ken Marino]]. One of the more ironic characters on the show, parodying sketch comedy characters who rely on catchphrases. Louie is a genial fellow with a strong desire to dip his \"balls\" (actual golf balls, although the innuendo was certainly intentional) in various things. His catchphrase, naturally, is a very enthusiastic \"I wanna dip my balls in it!\" One of the more memorable Louie sketches placed him at [[The Last Supper]], in which Louie and his catchphrase distract the [[Twelve Apostles]] from [[Jesus]]' speech concerning his fate. Louie would often tire of the gag halfway through the sketch, because he feels that it has \"been done\", but would be encouraged by the loving crowd to continue. The punch line was that Louie would tell them they knew what he was going to say, they would say they didn't but would then shout it along with him. According to DVD commentaries, \"Louie\" was originally a character who would only appear one time. MTV wanted a recurring character with a catchphrase, and the sketch was a \"fuck you\" to executives. According to a DVD commentary, \"Louie\" became a recurring character because \"We liked it!\"\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Louie\", 103: \"Louie II\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\", 303: \"Louie & the Last Supper\", 305: \"Doug IV\"\n|-\n| <center>Barry and Levon</center>\n| Played by [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and [[Michael Ian Black]], respectively. Suave swingers of ambiguous [[sexual orientation]]. Their most notable moment was a sketch in which they had purchased and prepared $240.00 worth of pudding, which sat in a pile that they proceeded to sweet-talk and dance with. This is another sketch which fell victim to a compromised soundtrack when released on [[iTunes]]. It was originally accompanied with \"[[Sexual Healing]]\" by [[Marvin Gaye]]. It also appears that the music was played on set and recorded directly into the master, as, according to the DVD commentary, the dialogue between Barry and Levon has been overdubbed. According to a DVD commentary, \"$240 Worth of Pudding\" was written by Black and Lennon.\n\nAppearances: 104: \"$240 Worth of Pudding\", 203: \"Barry and Levon\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\", 303: \"Deathfight 5000\", 306: \"Planet Groovy\"\n|-\n| <center>Old-Fashioned Guy</center>\n| Played by Thomas Lennon. A country gentleman who clings to antiquated, sometimes primitive beliefs, which seem absurd in modern society. \"Call me old fashioned ... but I think we should worship the sun and moon as powerful gods, and fear them.\"\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Old Fashioned Guy 1\", \"Old Fashioned Guy 2\", 106: \"Old Fashioned Guy\", 107: \"Old Fashioned Guy\"\n|-\n| <center>James Dixon</center>\n| Played by Thomas Lennon. A conniving, hard-driving ex-[[Hollywood]] agent who lands himself very unlikely careers (high school guidance counselor, [[Catholic]] priest, [[Jedi]] talent agent) and applies his showbiz tactics to his new positions. \"You can't bargain with God. But you can bargain with me, and I can bargain with God.\" According to DVD commentaries, the character was based on the group's agent, James Dixon.\n\nAppearances: 107: \"James Dixon: Guidance Counselor\", 201: \"James Dixon: Power Priest\", 313: \"Dixon: Jedi Talent Agency\"\n|-\n| <center>Barry Toink</center>\n| Played by [[Joe Lo Truglio]]. An extremely wordy high school jock. He is the focus of the season 2 sketch \"Bookworm\" in which he tries to find the word for \"one who loves books\"  so that he can make fun of a nerd in the cafeteria. He is one of the recurring characters, along with Doug, Louie, and Barry and Levon, featured in \"Kabuki Doug.\"\n\nAppearances: 103: \"Antonio\", 203: \"Bookworm\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\"\n|-\n| <center>Captain Monterey Jack</center>\n| Played by Michael Ian Black. A nonsense-spewing motivational speaker, a parody of similar anti-drug or alcohol abuse spots aired on MTV at the time. \"And remember, bbbbring, bbbring... Hello, cheese? '''NO!''' Cheese can't dial a phone.\" Doug ''(see above)'' made his first appearances in the Capt. Monterey Jack sketches.\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Lights\", 103: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Shoes\", 106: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Cheese\"\n|-\n| <center>The Jew, the Italian, and the Redhead Gay</center>\n| Played by [[David Wain]], [[Ken Marino]], and [[Kevin Allison]], respectively. Good-naturedly broad stereotypes, introduced after an announcement from The State that in the future, they would \"try to avoid stereotyping of any kind\".  The three are at first roommates, later crime-fighters in the style of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' who track down villains based on additional stereotypes (they succeed in catching an [[Irish people|Irish]] criminal after finding him at a bar). According to a DVD commentary, the original sketch was written by Marino, Allison, and Wain.\n\nAppearances: 301: \"The Jew, the Italian, and the Redhead Gay\", 308: \"Jew II, pt. 1\", \"Jew II, pt. 2\"\n|-\n| <center>Inbred Brothers</center>\n| Emmett played by Thomas Lennon. Lyle played by [[Ben Garant]]. Two very stupid inbred hillbilly brothers who spend a lot of time hitting themselves on the head. What would have been the first \"Inbred Brothers\" sketch was shot for season one but never aired. Catchphrase-( Emmett:) \"What am I doin'?\"\n\nAppearances: 205: \"Inbred Brothers\", 311: \"Inbred Brothers - Army\"\n|-\n| <center>Monkeys Do It</center>\n| Joey played by Joe Lo Truglio, Tony played by Ken Marino, Anthony played by Michael Showalter, Joseph played by Michael Ian Black, Tony's mother played by Thomas Lennon, Gina played by [[Kerri Kenney]], Sherry played by [[Todd Holoubek]]. Tony, Anthony, Joseph and Joey are four [[Italian-American]] teenage friends who hang out in Tony's basement. In the first sketch, they are bored on their summer vacation.  Joseph suggests they go to the zoo to watch the monkeys \"do it.\" They go on to get in some digs at Anthony's sister (a \"beautiful girl with a very hairy face\") and debate over whether or not [[penguins]] are \"natural\" (Anthony claims they were chemically man-made \"like [[The Incredible Hulk]]\" and that the [[Bible]] never mentions penguins). Tony's sister Gina and her best friend Sherry come downstairs, demanding that the boys take them along or else Gina will tell their mother about Tony's \"perversion.\" Gina and Tony bicker, then everyone else starts shouting, until Gina and Tony's mother comes down to see what the ruckus is.  After Gina tells Ma that the boys were planning to go to the zoo to watch the monkeys \"do it,\" Ma insists they all have \"dirty minds\" and that the monkeys don't \"do it\" - rather, they \"make love.\" She then describes how the monkeys would do such a thing, then asks Tony to grab her video camera and Joey to get her car so they can go to the zoo and \"watch the monkeys make amore.\" The characters were reprised later that season in a Thanksgiving-themed sketch, with several additional characters. According to the DVD commentary, the original sketch was written by Marino, Black, and possibly a forgotten co-writer/co-writers (possibly either Lo Truglio or Showalter)\n\nAppearances: 301: \"Monkeys Do It\", 307: \"Monkeys Do It II\"\n|-\n|}\n\n== Other works featuring the cast ==\n{| style=\"width:90%\"\n| style=\"width:30%\" | {{X mark}}  - regular cast member \n| style=\"width:30%\" |  {{Classicon|FA}} - guest appearance \n| style=\"width:30%\" |  {{Classicon|Image}} - directed ||\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n |- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n !

The cast consisted of 11 twenty-something [[comedian]]s who created, acted, wrote, directed and edited the show. In various combinations, the former members of the State have continued to collaborate over the years, with alumni playing major creative, directing and acting roles in a number of notable projects including ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' and ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.\n\nSeveral memorable characters were created for the show, and for a short time their [[catchphrase]]s entered into the vernacular. Often, the cast would appear as themselves and address the audience to promote fake contests or to deliver mock public service announcements. Much like ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'', ''The State'''s sketches were sometimes linked to each other in some way: a punchline or image that ended one sketch often provided a lead-in to the next.\n\nAfter years of legal issues related to the [[soundtrack]] to many of the episodes, the series was released on [[DVD]] on July 14, 2009. A ''State'' film featuring all of the original troupe members was planned, but faced delays due to the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007\u20132008 screenwriters strike]], and the project never came to fruition.<ref>{{cite web|first=Silas|last=Lesnick|title=EXCLUSIVE: David Wain on The Ten and Future Comedies!|website=The Movie Reporter|url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4107&Itemid=99|date=January 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114052009/http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4107&Itemid=99|archivedate=January 14, 2009|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==About the show==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}\n''The State'' is not only the name of the television program, but also of the comedy troupe that made up the cast of the show, as they have continued to successfully work together on film, television and in the world of journalism in various groupings. A book, ''State by State With the State'', was published in April 1997 but is currently out of print. An album titled ''[[Comedy for Gracious Living]]'' was recorded for [[Warner Bros.]] but was shelved for unknown reasons. After being unearthed from the Warner vault, it was finally released in September 2010 by Rhino/Handmade via rhino.com. With liner notes written by the troupe, the packaging is notable for having, perhaps, the longest printed booklet ever included in a CD package.\n\nThe show's style of humor revolved mainly around the cast members' character acting and high energy, and featured a broad range of comedic styles from [[satire]] to forays into absurdism, although the absurdist element was not played up as much until the third season.  Notable examples include \"The Animal Song\" and \"The Howard Report\".  In addition, a common theme of the show's humor was to introduce a sketch with a \"straight man\" character caught in a ridiculous premise, then turn the sketch around by making the premise turn out to be correct.\n\nDespite being limited by having only one female member, [[Kerri Kenney]]'s energy and acting range (portraying anyone from an average housewife to [[Nancy Spungen]]) led the cast to describe her as \"the only girl we need\".  In sketches that called for more than one female role, Kenney would usually portray the character that needed to appear the most \"feminine\", and the other roles would go to male cast members who would wear [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. In a number of sketches with a female character, Kenney does not appear. During the \"James Dixon: Power Priest\" sketch, James weds a young couple in which the bride is played by [[Michael Ian Black]], and on the DVD commentary for this sketch, the cast jokes that \"this is another instance of 'why didn't Kerri play the girl?'\".  In one unaired sketch, \"Drag Dad\", Kenney actually played a male character, but it was done purposefully as part of the running joke of the sketch.\n\n\"Contrary to popular belief\", says the troupe's official [[FAQ]], \"the show was never canceled.\"<ref name=\"The State's official FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-state.com/faq.htm#5|title=The State's official FAQ|website=thestate.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007020447/http://www.the-state.com/faq.htm#5|archivedate=2012-10-07}}</ref> For a variety of reasons, including network television politics, ''The State'' decided to pursue other interests and \"establish ourselves as an entity that exists apart from any particular employer or TV Network.\"<ref name=\"The State's official FAQ\"/> However, [[CBS]] optioned to buy the show after its second year on MTV in hopes of increasing viewership among younger demographics and potentially providing competition against [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.  CBS intended to test the waters with ''The State's 43rd Annual All-Star Halloween Special'', which aired in prime time in 1995.  The special received generally good reviews (including some from critics that gave them harsh ones earlier), but due to little promotion, it received low ratings. The show was not picked up for further broadcasts.  On the series' DVD commentary, cast members revealed that MTV had offered a contract guarantee for 65 additional shows, but the cast turned it down to leave to CBS, against their agent's advice.\n\nThe entire cast was featured (or made a cameo) in 2007's [[David Wain]]-directed film, ''[[The Ten (film)|The Ten]]''. On March 15, 2008, most of the cast reunited for a special reunion sketch show at [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n=== ''The State'' DVD release ===\nA [[DVD]] release was expected by fans of the show. However, MTV remained reluctant to distribute the show until a complete DVD set was released in 2009.\n\nA leading factor that delayed the release was the use of popular songs as background music in the original broadcast versions of nearly every episode. ''The State'' was produced during a period when MTV had deals with various record labels, via which the network could easily use many songs that had a video aired on the network in their original programming without having to pay royalties to the labels; ''The State'' used popular music as the background music for countless sketches, utilizing hits like [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\", [[The Breeders]]' \"[[Cannonball (The Breeders song)|Cannonball]]\", [[Liz Phair]]'s \"Supernova\" and [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[Sexual Healing]]\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010814100624/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/4795/songs.html List of songs used in The State]</ref> Due to the large [[royalty fee]]s each company would likely demand, the soundtrack as originally aired would have cost many times the amount that video sales would recoup, so ''The State'' was forced to re-record much of the backing music with different, sometimes [[sound-alike]], songs.\n\nThe first season of ''The State'', digitally re-mastered along with a new musical score, was made available on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]\u2019s [[iTunes Store]] on September 26, 2006. Several episodes were also made available on [[Amazon Unbox]] as well as the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].\n\nOn March 10, 2007, David Wain announced at a screening of ''[[The Ten]]'' at [[SXSW]] that a DVD of ''The State'' was in production. At a later [[Philadelphia]] screening, he claimed it would be available in the fall of 2007. On May 18, 2007, during the 24-hour ''[[Human Giant]]'' marathon on MTV, [[Michael Showalter]] announced that a DVD set containing the entire series would be released by MTV sometime that year. He stated the set would contain every episode (some re-scored), commentaries, extras, and some sketches that never made it to the air.\n\nThe State's official website reported in November 2007 that the DVD set was completed, but that their distributor, MTV, has \"chosen not to release the set at this time. We don't know why.\"<ref name=\"The State's official news page\">[http://www.the-state.com/ The State's official news page].</ref>  On January 29, 2008, Showalter confirmed that MTV was still delaying the release: \"They have it. We've made the DVD, and it exists.

The song is built around samples of [[The Nation of Ulysses]] songs \"The Kingdom of Heaven Must Be Taken By Storm\" (\"Boys and girls!\") and \"The Hickey Underworld\" (\"Action! Action!\").\n\n=== Recurring characters===\nThe cast (notably David Wain) have said that they were not interested in creating recurring characters, but were repeatedly pressured by the network to emulate ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in this manner. In turn, some of the recurring characters were made as satires of recurring characters (notably, \"Louie\" was made to satisfy network pressures for both a recurring character and catch-phrases, according to the casts' DVD commentary track).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| <center>Doug</center>\n| Played by [[Michael Showalter]]. A high school student and wannabe rebel who pointlessly struggles against surprisingly permissive and understanding authority figures. Doug's catchphrase is a wan \"I'm outta heeeerrre.\" A memorable sketch has Doug's father Don (Lennon) questioning him on his drug use. Doug replies \"Drugs?! Hey man, I'm Doug, not [[Bob Dylan]].\" His father asks him if he even knows who Bob Dylan is. Doug replies \"No...but I know he died of drugs.\" Doug's father then tells him Bob Dylan is alive and well, and that he in fact produced his last three albums, to which Doug replies, \"Oh, you mean Uncle Robert?\" He would often be followed by a group of friends (usually played by [[Ken Marino]], [[Kerri Kenney-Silver|Kerry Kenney]], [[Michael Patrick Jann]], and [[Joe Lo Truglio]]), who would inevitably find the authority figure cooler than Doug and decide to hang with them instead. Doug's father, Don, is played by [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and appears in the \"Doug\" sketches in 102, 204 and 305.\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Doug & Dad\", \"Captain Monterey Jack: Lights\", 103: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Shoes\", 106: \"Doug & Principal\", \"Captain Monterey Jack: Cheese\", 204: \"Doug III\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\", 305: \"Doug IV\"\n|-\n| <center>Louie</center>\n| Played by [[Ken Marino]]. One of the more ironic characters on the show, parodying sketch comedy characters who rely on catchphrases. Louie is a genial fellow with a strong desire to dip his \"balls\" (actual golf balls, although the innuendo was certainly intentional) in various things. His catchphrase, naturally, is a very enthusiastic \"I wanna dip my balls in it!\" One of the more memorable Louie sketches placed him at [[The Last Supper]], in which Louie and his catchphrase distract the [[Twelve Apostles]] from [[Jesus]]' speech concerning his fate. Louie would often tire of the gag halfway through the sketch, because he feels that it has \"been done\", but would be encouraged by the loving crowd to continue. The punch line was that Louie would tell them they knew what he was going to say, they would say they didn't but would then shout it along with him. According to DVD commentaries, \"Louie\" was originally a character who would only appear one time. MTV wanted a recurring character with a catchphrase, and the sketch was a \"fuck you\" to executives. According to a DVD commentary, \"Louie\" became a recurring character because \"We liked it!\"\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Louie\", 103: \"Louie II\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\", 303: \"Louie & the Last Supper\", 305: \"Doug IV\"\n|-\n| <center>Barry and Levon</center>\n| Played by [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and [[Michael Ian Black]], respectively. Suave swingers of ambiguous [[sexual orientation]]. Their most notable moment was a sketch in which they had purchased and prepared $240.00 worth of pudding, which sat in a pile that they proceeded to sweet-talk and dance with. This is another sketch which fell victim to a compromised soundtrack when released on [[iTunes]]. It was originally accompanied with \"[[Sexual Healing]]\" by [[Marvin Gaye]]. It also appears that the music was played on set and recorded directly into the master, as, according to the DVD commentary, the dialogue between Barry and Levon has been overdubbed. According to a DVD commentary, \"$240 Worth of Pudding\" was written by Black and Lennon.\n\nAppearances: 104: \"$240 Worth of Pudding\", 203: \"Barry and Levon\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\", 303: \"Deathfight 5000\", 306: \"Planet Groovy\"\n|-\n| <center>Old-Fashioned Guy</center>\n| Played by Thomas Lennon. A country gentleman who clings to antiquated, sometimes primitive beliefs, which seem absurd in modern society. \"Call me old fashioned ... but I think we should worship the sun and moon as powerful gods, and fear them.\"\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Old Fashioned Guy 1\", \"Old Fashioned Guy 2\", 106: \"Old Fashioned Guy\", 107: \"Old Fashioned Guy\"\n|-\n| <center>James Dixon</center>\n| Played by Thomas Lennon. A conniving, hard-driving ex-[[Hollywood]] agent who lands himself very unlikely careers (high school guidance counselor, [[Catholic]] priest, [[Jedi]] talent agent) and applies his showbiz tactics to his new positions. \"You can't bargain with God. But you can bargain with me, and I can bargain with God.\" According to DVD commentaries, the character was based on the group's agent, James Dixon.\n\nAppearances: 107: \"James Dixon: Guidance Counselor\", 201: \"James Dixon: Power Priest\", 313: \"Dixon: Jedi Talent Agency\"\n|-\n| <center>Barry Toink</center>\n| Played by [[Joe Lo Truglio]]. An extremely wordy high school jock. He is the focus of the season 2 sketch \"Bookworm\" in which he tries to find the word for \"one who loves books\"  so that he can make fun of a nerd in the cafeteria. He is one of the recurring characters, along with Doug, Louie, and Barry and Levon, featured in \"Kabuki Doug.\"\n\nAppearances: 103: \"Antonio\", 203: \"Bookworm\", 302: \"Kabuki Doug\"\n|-\n| <center>Captain Monterey Jack</center>\n| Played by Michael Ian Black. A nonsense-spewing motivational speaker, a parody of similar anti-drug or alcohol abuse spots aired on MTV at the time. \"And remember, bbbbring, bbbring... Hello, cheese? '''NO!''' Cheese can't dial a phone.\" Doug ''(see above)'' made his first appearances in the Capt. Monterey Jack sketches.\n\nAppearances: 102: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Lights\", 103: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Shoes\", 106: \"Captain Monterey Jack: Cheese\"\n|-\n| <center>The Jew, the Italian, and the Redhead Gay</center>\n| Played by [[David Wain]], [[Ken Marino]], and [[Kevin Allison]], respectively. Good-naturedly broad stereotypes, introduced after an announcement from The State that in the future, they would \"try to avoid stereotyping of any kind\".  The three are at first roommates, later crime-fighters in the style of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' who track down villains based on additional stereotypes (they succeed in catching an [[Irish people|Irish]] criminal after finding him at a bar). According to a DVD commentary, the original sketch was written by Marino, Allison, and Wain.\n\nAppearances: 301: \"The Jew, the Italian, and the Redhead Gay\", 308: \"Jew II, pt. 1\", \"Jew II, pt. 2\"\n|-\n| <center>Inbred Brothers</center>\n| Emmett played by Thomas Lennon. Lyle played by [[Ben Garant]]. Two very stupid inbred hillbilly brothers who spend a lot of time hitting themselves on the head. What would have been the first \"Inbred Brothers\" sketch was shot for season one but never aired. Catchphrase-( Emmett:) \"What am I doin'?\"\n\nAppearances: 205: \"Inbred Brothers\", 311: \"Inbred Brothers - Army\"\n|-\n| <center>Monkeys Do It</center>\n| Joey played by Joe Lo Truglio, Tony played by Ken Marino, Anthony played by Michael Showalter, Joseph played by Michael Ian Black, Tony's mother played by Thomas Lennon, Gina played by [[Kerri Kenney]], Sherry played by [[Todd Holoubek]]. Tony, Anthony, Joseph and Joey are four [[Italian-American]] teenage friends who hang out in Tony's basement. In the first sketch, they are bored on their summer vacation.  Joseph suggests they go to the zoo to watch the monkeys \"do it.\" They go on to get in some digs at Anthony's sister (a \"beautiful girl with a very hairy face\") and debate over whether or not [[penguins]] are \"natural\" (Anthony claims they were chemically man-made \"like [[The Incredible Hulk]]\" and that the [[Bible]] never mentions penguins). Tony's sister Gina and her best friend Sherry come downstairs, demanding that the boys take them along or else Gina will tell their mother about Tony's \"perversion.\" Gina and Tony bicker, then everyone else starts shouting, until Gina and Tony's mother comes down to see what the ruckus is.  After Gina tells Ma that the boys were planning to go to the zoo to watch the monkeys \"do it,\" Ma insists they all have \"dirty minds\" and that the monkeys don't \"do it\" - rather, they \"make love.\" She then describes how the monkeys would do such a thing, then asks Tony to grab her video camera and Joey to get her car so they can go to the zoo and \"watch the monkeys make amore.\" The characters were reprised later that season in a Thanksgiving-themed sketch, with several additional characters. According to the DVD commentary, the original sketch was written by Marino, Black, and possibly a forgotten co-writer/co-writers (possibly either Lo Truglio or Showalter)\n\nAppearances: 301: \"Monkeys Do It\", 307: \"Monkeys Do It II\"\n|-\n|}\n\n== Other works featuring the cast ==\n{| style=\"width:90%\"\n| style=\"width:30%\" | {{X mark}}  - regular cast member \n| style=\"width:30%\" |  {{Classicon|FA}} - guest appearance \n| style=\"width:30%\" |  {{Classicon|Image}} - directed ||\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n |- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n !

Ernesti was professor of poetry at [[Leipzig University]] and director of the [[Thomasschule]].

The series remains incredibly popular in Italy  {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n''The Rose of Versailles'' focuses on [[Oscar Fran\u00e7ois de Jarjayes]], a girl raised as a man to become her father's successor as leader of the Palace Guards. A brilliant combatant with a strong sense of justice, Oscar is proud of the life she leads, but becomes torn between class loyalty and her desire to help the impoverished as revolution brews among the oppressed lower class. Also important to the story are her conflicting desires to live life as both a militant and a regular woman as well as her relationships with [[Marie Antoinette]], Count [[Hans Axel von Fersen (Lady Oscar)|Axel von Fersen]], and servant and best friend [[Andr\u00e9 Grandier]].\n\nIt features elements of the [[yuri (genre)|yuri genre]] embodied in the relationship between Oscar and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Rosalie Lamorli\u00e8re, the secret daughter of the scheming [[Duchess de Polignac (Lady Oscar)|Madame de Polignac]].

In the early part of the series, the main character is the young, flighty Queen of France, [[Marie Antoinette]], however later the focus of the story shifts to a woman named [[Oscar Fran\u00e7ois de Jarjayes]]. Oscar's father, General Jarjayes, despaired over never getting a son (he had six daughters), and decided to raise his youngest daughter as a man. He trained her well in the arts of [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[horsemanship]] and [[Historical European martial arts|medieval combat]]. Oscar often practiced her skills with her best friend, companion and (technically) servant, Andr\u00e9 Grandier, whom she almost always defeated. Andr\u00e9 is the grandson of her nanny and thus they spent most of their time together in harmonic friendship; near the end of the story, this friendship blossoms into mutual love.\n\nOscar is the commander of the Royal Guard and responsible for the safety of Marie Antoinette, as well as the rest of the royal family. The story revolves around Oscar's growing realization of how France is governed, and the plight of the poor. Another important storyline is the love story between Marie Antoinette and the Swedish Count [[Axel von Fersen, Jr.|Axel von Fersen]]. The affair between the two is the subject of rumours through all of France, endangering the Queen's reputation and driving Oscar to request the Count to leave the country.\n\nAfter the Count decides to leave and sign up for the American war of independence, Marie Antoinette becomes lovesick. She spends money in excess \u2013 expensive jewellery and clothes, attending balls every other night \u2013 to distract herself from pining for the only man she loved. This, in turn, weighs on the taxpayers of France, and poverty spreads throughout the country due to Marie Antoinette's squandering of money. Both the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]] and the appearance of the infamous [[Gabrielle de Polastron, comtesse de Polignac]] are central plot events taken from history, as well as the [[French Revolution]] and the fall of the Bastille \u2013 all given interesting interpretations through the fictional character Oscar and her companions.\n\nOn July 14, 1789, [[Storming of the Bastille|the Taking of the Bastille]], the crowds rebel but lack strategy, giving the military the advantage and making themselves easy target for cannon fire. However, Oscar and the regiment B then arrive to help organize the insurgents. During the following fierce battle, Oscar is shot and killed, but the Bastille eventually falls, symbolically striking down the French monarchy. After the Bastille is taken, the revolutionaries burst into the Palace searching for Marie Antoinette and her family. Many guards are killed and the royal family taken prisoner. Big trials are started for Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, but finally, both are declared guilty and [[guillotined]].\n\n==Development==\nIkeda's editors were opposed to her idea of a biography of Marie Antoinette, and only its popularity among readers kept ''The Rose of Versailles'' in publication. Ikeda had read [[Stefan Zweig]]'s [[Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman|biography of Marie Antoinette]] in high school, and the first chapters focus on the queen, casting her as a ''sh\u014djo'' heroine, and Du Barry as a rival. Oscar was created as a supporting character. Oscar eclipsed Marie Antoinette in popularity and due to reader feedback became the main character until her death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shamoon |first=Deborah |editor=Lunning, Frenchy |title=Networks of Desire |series=Mechademia |chapter-url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html |volume=2 |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|isbn=978-0-8166-5266-2 |chapter=Revolutionary Romance: ''The Rose of Versailles'' and the Transformation of Sh\u014djo Manga |pages= 7\u20138 }}</ref> Ikeda was influenced by [[Feminism in Japan#Second-wave feminism and birth control activism|second-wave feminist]] ideas when creating ''The Rose of Versailles'', using the French Revolution to depict the \"inner revolution of the Japanese women\" at that time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Anan|first1=Nobuko|title=''The Rose of Versailles'': Women and Revolution in Girls' Manga and the Socialist Movement in Japan|journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]|date=February 2014|volume=47|issue=1|pages=41\u201363|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12107}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of The Rose of Versailles chapters}}\n\n''The Rose of Versailles'' is one of the most influential manga ever written.<ref name=\"pro\">{{cite web| url=http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/RoV.htm | title= The Rose of Versailles: Overview | work= ProCulture.ca |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> The manga was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Margaret (magazine)|Margaret]]'' in 1973, and became an instant success.

A brilliant combatant with a strong sense of justice, Oscar is proud of the life she leads, but becomes torn between class loyalty and her desire to help the impoverished as revolution brews among the oppressed lower class. Also important to the story are her conflicting desires to live life as both a militant and a regular woman as well as her relationships with [[Marie Antoinette]], Count [[Hans Axel von Fersen (Lady Oscar)|Axel von Fersen]], and servant and best friend [[Andr\u00e9 Grandier]].\n\nIt features elements of the [[yuri (genre)|yuri genre]] embodied in the relationship between Oscar and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Rosalie Lamorli\u00e8re, the secret daughter of the scheming [[Duchess de Polignac (Lady Oscar)|Madame de Polignac]].

In the early part of the series, the main character is the young, flighty Queen of France, [[Marie Antoinette]], however later the focus of the story shifts to a woman named [[Oscar Fran\u00e7ois de Jarjayes]]. Oscar's father, General Jarjayes, despaired over never getting a son (he had six daughters), and decided to raise his youngest daughter as a man. He trained her well in the arts of [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[horsemanship]] and [[Historical European martial arts|medieval combat]]. Oscar often practiced her skills with her best friend, companion and (technically) servant, Andr\u00e9 Grandier, whom she almost always defeated. Andr\u00e9 is the grandson of her nanny and thus they spent most of their time together in harmonic friendship; near the end of the story, this friendship blossoms into mutual love.\n\nOscar is the commander of the Royal Guard and responsible for the safety of Marie Antoinette, as well as the rest of the royal family. The story revolves around Oscar's growing realization of how France is governed, and the plight of the poor. Another important storyline is the love story between Marie Antoinette and the Swedish Count [[Axel von Fersen, Jr.|Axel von Fersen]]. The affair between the two is the subject of rumours through all of France, endangering the Queen's reputation and driving Oscar to request the Count to leave the country.\n\nAfter the Count decides to leave and sign up for the American war of independence, Marie Antoinette becomes lovesick. She spends money in excess \u2013 expensive jewellery and clothes, attending balls every other night \u2013 to distract herself from pining for the only man she loved. This, in turn, weighs on the taxpayers of France, and poverty spreads throughout the country due to Marie Antoinette's squandering of money. Both the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]] and the appearance of the infamous [[Gabrielle de Polastron, comtesse de Polignac]] are central plot events taken from history, as well as the [[French Revolution]] and the fall of the Bastille \u2013 all given interesting interpretations through the fictional character Oscar and her companions.\n\nOn July 14, 1789, [[Storming of the Bastille|the Taking of the Bastille]], the crowds rebel but lack strategy, giving the military the advantage and making themselves easy target for cannon fire. However, Oscar and the regiment B then arrive to help organize the insurgents. During the following fierce battle, Oscar is shot and killed, but the Bastille eventually falls, symbolically striking down the French monarchy. After the Bastille is taken, the revolutionaries burst into the Palace searching for Marie Antoinette and her family. Many guards are killed and the royal family taken prisoner. Big trials are started for Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, but finally, both are declared guilty and [[guillotined]].\n\n==Development==\nIkeda's editors were opposed to her idea of a biography of Marie Antoinette, and only its popularity among readers kept ''The Rose of Versailles'' in publication. Ikeda had read [[Stefan Zweig]]'s [[Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman|biography of Marie Antoinette]] in high school, and the first chapters focus on the queen, casting her as a ''sh\u014djo'' heroine, and Du Barry as a rival. Oscar was created as a supporting character. Oscar eclipsed Marie Antoinette in popularity and due to reader feedback became the main character until her death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shamoon |first=Deborah |editor=Lunning, Frenchy |title=Networks of Desire |series=Mechademia |chapter-url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html |volume=2 |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|isbn=978-0-8166-5266-2 |chapter=Revolutionary Romance: ''The Rose of Versailles'' and the Transformation of Sh\u014djo Manga |pages= 7\u20138 }}</ref> Ikeda was influenced by [[Feminism in Japan#Second-wave feminism and birth control activism|second-wave feminist]] ideas when creating ''The Rose of Versailles'', using the French Revolution to depict the \"inner revolution of the Japanese women\" at that time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Anan|first1=Nobuko|title=''The Rose of Versailles'': Women and Revolution in Girls' Manga and the Socialist Movement in Japan|journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]|date=February 2014|volume=47|issue=1|pages=41\u201363|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12107}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of The Rose of Versailles chapters}}\n\n''The Rose of Versailles'' is one of the most influential manga ever written.<ref name=\"pro\">{{cite web| url=http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/RoV.htm | title= The Rose of Versailles: Overview | work= ProCulture.ca |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref> The manga was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Margaret (magazine)|Margaret]]'' in 1973, and became an instant success.

Her most recent anthology is called ''Is This Forever, Or What?: Poems & Paintings from Texas''. Her poems are frank and accessible, often making use of ordinary images in startling ways.

Her other books include poetry collections ''[[19 Varieties of Gazelle|19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems of the Middle East]]'', ''Red Suitcase'', and ''Fuel''; a collection of essays entitled ''Never in a Hurry''; a young-adult novel called ''[[Habibi (novel)|Habibi]]'' (the autobiographical story of an Arab-American teenager who moves to Jerusalem in the 1970s) and picture book ''Lullaby Raft'', which is also the title of one of her two albums of music. (The other is called Rutabaga-Roo; both were limited-edition.)\n\nNye has edited many anthologies of poems, for audiences both young and old. One of the best-known is ''This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from around the World'', which contains translated work by 129 poets from 68 different countries. Her most recent anthology is called ''Is This Forever, Or What?: Poems & Paintings from Texas''. Her poems are frank and accessible, often making use of ordinary images in startling ways. Her ability to enter into foreign experiences and chronicle them from the inside is reminiscent of [[Elizabeth Bishop]], while her simple and direct \"voice\" is akin to that of her mentor [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]].\n\nShe has won many awards and fellowships, among them four [[Pushcart Prize]]s, the [[Jane Addams Children's Book Award]], the Paterson Poetry Prize, and many notable book and best book citations from the American Library Association.

''Hugging the Jukebox'' (1982), a full-length collection that won the Voertman Poetry Prize, focuses on the connections between diverse peoples and on the perspectives of those in other lands. ''Yellow Glove'' (1986) presents poems with more tragic and sorrowful themes.

Produced by and broadcast on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]], the series attained an instant cult status that persists to the present day.\n\nThe lead character, '''Aunty Jack''' was a unique comic creation &mdash; an obese, moustachioed, gravel-voiced [[cross-dressing|crossdresser]], part [[Truck driver|trucker]] and part [[pantomime dame]] &mdash; who habitually solved any problem by knocking people unconscious or threatening to \"rip their bloody arms off\". Visually, she was unmistakable, dressed in a huge, tent-like blue velvet dress, [[football]] socks, workboots, and a golden [[boxing]] glove on her right hand. She rode everywhere on a [[Harley-Davidson]] [[motorcycle]] and referred to everyone as \"me little lovelies\" &mdash; when she was not uttering her familiar threat: \"I'll rip yer bloody arms off!\", a phrase which immediately passed into the vernacular. The character was devised and played by the multi-talented [[Grahame Bond]] and was partly inspired by his overbearing Uncle Jack, whom he had disliked as a child,<ref>Rob Johnson & David Smiedt, ''Boom-boom! A Century of Australian Comedy'' (Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney, 1999), p.189</ref> his grandfather Ben Doyle and [[Dot Strong]] the ABC's last official tea lady.\n\n==Background==\nAn [[architecture]] graduate of [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]], Bond was already an accomplished writer, producer, comedian, singer, songwriter and guitarist by the time he graduated. He cut his teeth writing and performing as a founder member and leading light of the University's legendary Architecture Revues from 1964\u201369. It was here that he met and became friends with other Sydney students including [[Geoffrey Atherden]], [[Maurice Murphy (director)|Maurice Murphy]] and [[Peter Weir]], who became Australia's most internationally acclaimed film director. Through these stage revues Grahame also met his longtime musical, writing and acting partner [[Rory O'Donoghue]], who had begun his performing career playing [[The Artful Dodger]] in a Sydney production of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' as well as being the lead singer and guitarist in the Sydney rock bands [[The Pogs]] and [[Oakapple Day]]. Rory was only 14 at the time he met Bond, when The Pogs were brought in to provide musical backing for one of the Architecture Revues.\n\nAfter graduating, Grahame and friends continued working together on a wide range of projects in radio, theatre, TV and film. He collaborated on several short films and stage pieces with Peter Weir, and wrote and played in a number of stage comedies and revues. The success of Bond's work in the Architecture Revues led to a professional stage revue for the PACT Theatre Company, ''Balloon Dubloon'' (1969) with Peter Weir, which in turn led to an invitation from festival director [[Sir Robert Helpmann]] to stage a revue, ''Drip Dry Dreams'' at the [[Adelaide Festival]] and Richbrooke.\n\nThrough Bob Allnutt, a staffer at the [[PACT Theatre Company]] who also worked for the ABC's Religious Affairs Department, Weir, Bond and friends were commissioned to produce a TV special, ''[[Man On A Green Bike]]'', a fantasy that examined three different views of Christmas; this screened on ABC-TV at the end of December 1969. The 50-minute film, which was Bond's first known TV appearance, was co-written by and starred Bond and Peter Weir, with [[Geoff Malone]], James Dellit, and [[Anna Nygh]]. The story concerned three men, once friends sharing many adventures, who are now mayors of three cities\u2014medieval Ackley, the futuristic Cadmium, and Petal Lake, a community reminiscent of the 1930s. Into their midst comes the strange figure of Mr. Maloon, a man travelling on a heavily laden green bike, whose presence disturbs and embarrasses the mayors.<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.190</ref>\n\nDuring 1970 Bond, Weir and co. created and performed the revue ''Filth'' at the [[Phillip Street Theatre|Phillip St Revue]], followed by ''Hamlet On Ice'' at the [[Nimrod Theatre Company|Nimrod Theatre]]. Bond's friendship with Weir led to him writing the music for the three-part AFI Award-winning 1970 film ''[[Three To Go]]'' (in which he also had a small acting role), for which Weir directed one segment. Bond also provided the music and played a leading role in Weir's first film, the 1971 short feature ''[[Homesdale]]''.\n\n==Origin==\nAunty Jack was created for a proposed [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]] children's radio series, \"The Aunty Jack Show\", commissioned by [[Paddy Conroy]] (former head of ABC TV and now cable channel manager). It was intended to replace the long-running children's radio series ''[[Argonauts Club|The Argonauts Club]]'', which was about to be cancelled. The new series never went to air because ABC executives felt that the Aunty Jack character and some of Grahame's songs were \"inappropriate\" for young listeners.\n\nThe Aunty Jack character made her TV debut in ''Aunty Jack's Travelling Show'', an episode of ABC-TV's ''[[The Comedy Game]]'', broadcast in late 1971. It was originally to be called ''Aunty Jack's Travelling Abattoirs'' but ABC executives also found the title inappropriate. The program featured Bond, O'Donoghue and Derum, with Sharman Mellick and [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] in supporting roles.\n\nThis marked the start of a fruitful partnership between Bond, O'Donoghue and ABC writer, producer and director [[Maurice Murphy (director)|Maurice Murphy]]. They became the creative nucleus for a string of programs that strongly influenced TV comedy in Australia.\n\n==Influences==\nAlthough frequently compared to ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', as the two teams evidently shared the same love of [[surreal humour]], the Aunty Jack character appeared well before The British show was screened in Australia. [[The Goon Show|The Goons]] have also been mentioned as an inspiration, but in Johnson and Smiedt's history of Australian comedy ''Boom Boom'', Bond himself said that he had listened to The Goons only occasionally. He mentioned Australian radio star [[Jack Davey]], [[Bob Dyer]], ''the [[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' and ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' as early interests, but cited the surreal black humour of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' as a major comedic influence.<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.184</ref>\n\n[[Peter Weir]] was also involved behind the scenes in the early days of the series. He had been part of the university revues they had done together in the 1960s, and had a small part in ''Homesdale'' and was credited as a writer on the ''Aunty Jack's Travelling Show'' and four episodes of the subsequent series. He gave up performing just before ''The Aunty Jack Show'', saying in a later interview: \"We were very much in the vein of Monty Python, and I saw them in England and they were so superior to what we did\u2026 that was it. I told my writing partner I wanted to focus on films, I sold him my sketches and that was it. It was very difficult because he had just gotten a TV deal.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/01/peter-weir-shunned-stanley-kubrick-made-green-card-out-of-depression-10-things-learned-120966/|title=Peter Weir Shunned Stanley Kubrick, Made \u2018Green Card\u2019 Out Of Depression & 10 Things Learned\u2026 - IndieWire|first=Christopher|last=Bell|website=www.indiewire.com}}</ref>\n\nMaurice Murphy was a pivotal figure in this fertile era of Australian television comedy\u2014he oversaw ''Aunty Jack'' and its various spin-off series, and also acted as a vital buffer between the Aunty Jack creative team and the ABC's conservative management. [[Ted Robinson (TV director)|Ted Robinson]], then a young director, got his break working for Murphy on the second series of ''Aunty Jack''. Robinson later took over Murphy's mantle in the 1980s, producing some of the best Australian TV comedy series of the period, including ''[[The Big Gig]]'' and ''[[The Gillies Report]]''. Interviewed for ''Mouthing Off'', a history of Australian comedy, Robinson enthusiastically sang Murphy's praises:\n\n:\"When I was brought in to work on the second series of ''The Aunty Jack Show'', it was my first contact with television comedy, and I was amazed by the atmosphere of drive and energy that Maurice generated. He made it such an exciting time to be working in comedy because the creative climate under him was so open; nothing was considered too mad or bad or off-the-wall that it wouldn't be considered for broadcast. People like me were able to learn their craft 'on-air' in those days, which meant that we were able to make mistakes or even fail completely with programs and still have a job. Maurice encouraged us to take risks and experiment with comedy and I believe this resulted in some of the best and most innovative comedy ever seen on Australian television.\"\n\n''Aunty Jack's Travelling Show'' convinced the ABC to commission a short series, to be screened weekly. ''The Aunty Jack Show'' premiered on 16 November 1972 and became an immediate cult hit with younger audiences, although it was poorly received by critics. Some viewers found it too confronting, and according to Murphy, the ABC received hundreds of calls after the first episode, complaining about the violence, the \"bad language\" and especially about the [[drag (clothing)|drag]] aspect of the Aunty Jack character.\n\n==Public reaction and cancellation==\n[[File:Season1.jpg|208x208px|thumb| Flange Desire, Aunty Jack, Thin Arthur, and Narrator Neville in 1972]]\nThe adverse reaction was reportedly strong enough for the ABC to seriously consider taking the series off the air, but it is generally reported that impassioned pleas from the children of certain ABC executives saved the show from being cancelled. This would not be the team's last such run-in with management, however, and the tensions between the creative and bureaucratic elements in the ABC eventually came to a head with ''[[The Off Show]]'' in 1977.\n\nBond cancelled the show at the end of the second season by having Aunty Jack die of a heart attack, 'mortified' by the other cast members' 'dirty' language and content. Nevertheless, the cast was revived and returned for a special two years later to mark the inauguration of [[colour television]] in Australia on 1 March 1975. The special beat ABC's commercial rivals by beginning 3 minutes early, at 11:57 pm 28 February 1975 in black and white and then [[Wipe (transition)|wiping]] to colour at midnight.\n\n== Episodes ==\nTwo series of ''The Aunty Jack Show'' were made in 1972 and 1973 respectively. The first series comprised seven episodes, the second six episodes. There were also two specials, one aired 8 June 1973 before the second series began in October, and a second aired in 1975 and an unaired pilot, before the series started. Each episode was built around a central theme.\n\n=== Unaired pilot (1972) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Episode titles\n!Original TV broadcast dates<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|1\n|Aunty Jack's Travelling Show\n|Unaired\n|}\n\n=== Series one (1972) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Episode titles\n!Original TV broadcast dates<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/the-aunty-jack-show/episodes.html|title=Australian Television: The Aunty Jack Show: episode guide|website=www.australiantelevision.net|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n|-\n|1\n|Radio\n|16 November 1972\n|-\n|2\n|War\n|23 November 1972\n|-\n|3\n|Kulture\n|30 November 1972\n|-\n|4\n|Anonymous\n|7 December 1972\n|-\n|5\n|Family\n|14 December 1972\n|-\n|6\n|Sex\n|21 December 1972\n|-\n|7\n|Horror\n|28 December 1972\n|}\n\n=== Special (1973) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Episode titles\n!Original TV broadcast dates<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|1\n|Aunty Jack Rox On\n|8 June 1973\n|}\n\n=== Series two (1973) ===\n'''Regular cast''':\n:Aunty Jack - [[Grahame Bond]]\n:Kid Eager - [[Garry McDonald]]\n:Thin Arthur - [[Rory O'Donoghue]]\n:Flange Desire - Sandra McGregor\n\n{{Episode table |overall= |title= |airdate= |aux1=|aux1T = Length| aux2= | aux2T = [[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect ratio]]|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = {{vanchor|The Channel Nine Show}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|df=y|1973|10|25}}<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/the-aunty-jack-show/episodes.html|title=Australian Television: The Aunty Jack Show: episode guide|website=www.australiantelevision.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n| Aux1            = 30 minutes\n| Aux2            = 4:3\n| ShortSummary    = \nThe episode sees [[Nine Network|Channel 9]] launching a new-look Aunty Jack Show, starring Kid Eager as Aunty Jack.

Derum appeared in archival footage in the special, Aunty Jack Rox On, and was replaced in Series 2 by a new cast member, [[Garry McDonald]], a talented young actor, comedian and musician, who had recently graduated from the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]]. His main role was as Aunty Jack's new sidekick, the cheeky, gum-chewing, freckle-faced Kid Eager. In one episode McDonald premiered a new character, devised by a viewer [[imdbname:2473486|Wendy Skelcher]] who had taken up a writing course and was inspired by the first episodes to write and submit scripts, which were welcomed by the team. This character featured only briefly in ''Aunty Jack'', but became much more prominent in the spin-off ''[[Wollongong the Brave]]'' as the Wollongong media 'un-personality' [[Norman Gunston]]. The Gunston character also appeared on the ''[[Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong]]'' LP and starred in the Logie-winning [[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]] parody, ''[[The Norman Gunston Show]]'', which premiered in 1975.\n\nSome of the sketches over the two series included the following:\n* ''Tarzan Superape'' (\"An origami rock opera\"), which parodied ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''\n* ''Dried Elephant Arrangements for Beginners'', in which Aunty Jack visits [[Taronga Zoo]] to teach viewers the fine art of \"elephanto reducioso\" with the reluctant assistance of Colin the elephant\n* Colonel Passionfruit, a campy military commander who led his squad of gay troops through a dangerous choreographed war with the help of The Pride Of Erin Mine Avoidance Tactic #III\n* [[country music|Country and eastern]] singers, The Farrelly Brothers, who performed a unique version of [[Leslie Morrison|Lucky Starr's]] \"[[I've Been Everywhere]]\" - but in this version the only places they had been were the NSW regional towns of [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] and [[Dapto, New South Wales|Dapto]] (Bond's home town)\n* ''Flat 1A 968 George St'' (a parody of popular 'sex and sin' soap opera ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'') in which viewers were promised \"lots of bottoms and lots of breasts\" - at which point two actors are shown, clad in multiple plastic 'joke' bottoms and breasts.\n\n==Feature film==\nA compilation of colour filmed segments from the first series was edited into an 85-minute feature ''The Very Best of The Aunty Jack Show'' which was screened at the 1973 [[Rose d'Or|Montreux Film Festival]]. It was not seen by Australian audiences until it was broadcast on ABC television on 26 January 1991.<ref>{{cite book|title=Directory of World Cinema: Australia and New Zealand 2|page=154|author=Ben Goldsmith and Geoff Lealand|publisher=Intellect|year=2015|isbn=1841506346}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Farewell Aunty Jack.jpg|250px|thumb|Aunty Jack and Thin Arthur from the picture disk Farewell Aunty Jack (1973)]] -->\nThe popularity of the series led to a one-off TV special, ''Aunty Jack Rox On'' with special guest [[Stevie Wright (Australian singer)|Stevie Wright]], a concert tour, a #1 hit single, \"[[Farewell Aunty Jack]]\" (a version of the closing theme of the series) and a best-selling album ''[[Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong]]'', released in early 1974. \"Farewell Aunty Jack\" was released as a single in December 1973, reached Number 1 on the Australian charts a week later, where it stayed for 3 weeks.  It was the first Australian single in picture-disc form to hit No.1 nationally, reputedly being the first disc of its kind in the world (although \"Goondiwindi Grey\" by Tex Morton in 1972 had also been issued in Australia as a picture disc too, but didn't hit the top spot nationally). \n\nBy the time Series 2 was underway Bond was already tired of Aunty Jack<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.222</ref> so he decided to kill her off in the final episode, \"The R-Certificate Show\" when, shocked by the gratuitous sex and nudity, Aunty Jack expires from a heart attack. Bond then departed for a much-needed holiday on [[Norfolk Island]] where, jointly inspired by the convict ruins and his holiday reading, [[Errol Flynn]]'s ''[[My Wicked Wicked Ways]]'', he came up with the concept for a new series set in the bushranger days, which became ''[[Flash Nick From Jindivik]]''.\n\nThe next outing for the classic Aunty Jack team was ''[[Wollongong the Brave]]'' (1974), a series of four one-hour specials that showcased favourite characters from the series. Episode 1 ''Aunty Jack'n'The Gong in Bloody Concert'' featured the core characters, augmented by a rock group. Episode 2 featured 'Country and Mediterranean' music group The Farelly Brothers and their singing sheep Jason; Episode 3 featured meat guru Kev Kavanagh and the final instalment ''Norman Gunston: The Golden Weeks'' eventually spawned ''The Norman Gunston Show'' in late 1975.\n\nAt 11:57 PM on Friday 28 February 1975, Aunty Jack, Thin Arthur, and Kid Eager introduced colour television broadcasting on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]], beating another channel's first colour program by deliberately starting three minutes early. The team's last major TV collaboration was the abortive comedy series ''[[The Off Show]]'' (1977) which was cancelled after only a few episodes following a controversial incident in which ABC executive Alan Batemen pulled the premiere episode from the schedule half an hour before it was due to air and then erased the tape, reportedly because he was offended by the [[Bill Harding]] religious parody sketch \"Leave It To Jesus\".<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.237</ref>\n\nAlthough fans long hoped that the show might be released on home video, it was more than thirty years after the show's first screening until this took place. Although there have been a number of reasons suggested, it is generally accepted that the major stumbling block was a long-running disagreement between Bond and the ABC, stemming from Bond and O'Donoghue's resentment over the presumed loss of several ''Aunty Jack'' episodes and the ''Off Show'' incident. Since Bond and O'Donoghue controlled the rights for all the original music featured in the series, their refusal to release them effectively kept the series off home video until 2005.\n\nFor many years there were persistent rumours\u2014fuelled by press statements from Bond himself\u2014that some episodes had been lost or destroyed. This was given added credence by the fact that (like the [[BBC]]) the ABC had undertaken an \"economy drive\" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which (it has been reported) that substantial portions of many shows were erased.\n\nAlthough (according to Bond<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiohaha.typepad.com/central/spike_milligan/|title=Radio Ha Ha|website=Radio Ha Ha}}</ref>) the original master tapes for three episodes were erased, all the original film footage shot for the missing episodes had survived and with the assistance of the [[National Archives of Australia]] the footage was located and restored, enabling the missing episodes to be reconstructed. The long-awaited release of the complete Series 1 on DVD took place in December 2005, and the complete Series 2 followed in April 2006. Although the master videotapes were monochrome, and the main episodes are presented in this format on DVD, much of the footage for the series was filmed in colour and these are included as alternate scenes.  The only episode in the entire Aunty Jack Show series not to be released on DVD was the 1973 special, 'Aunty Jack Rox On'.\n\nIn 2019, ''[[TV Week]]'' listed ''The Aunty Jack Show''  at #99 in its list of the 101 greatest Australian television shows of all time, which appeared in its monthly ''[[TV Week#TV Week Close Up|TV Week Close Up]]'' publication.  The magazine said the character's aggressive attitude, her golden boxing glove and her \"I'll rip yer bloody arms off\" catchprase quickly established her, and the show, as comedy icons.\n<ref>Burfitt, John; Cullen, Tamara; Hadley, Amy; Hockey, Maddison; Mitchell, Thomas; Recchi, Karina; Vnuk, Helen; Wang, Cynthia; Zubeidi, Zara (July 2019), 101 Greatest Aussie TV Shows of All Time, ''[[TV Week#TV Week Close Up|TV Week Close Up]]'', [[Bauer Media Group]].

Produced by and broadcast on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]], the series attained an instant cult status that persists to the present day.\n\nThe lead character, '''Aunty Jack''' was a unique comic creation &mdash; an obese, moustachioed, gravel-voiced [[cross-dressing|crossdresser]], part [[Truck driver|trucker]] and part [[pantomime dame]] &mdash; who habitually solved any problem by knocking people unconscious or threatening to \"rip their bloody arms off\". Visually, she was unmistakable, dressed in a huge, tent-like blue velvet dress, [[football]] socks, workboots, and a golden [[boxing]] glove on her right hand. She rode everywhere on a [[Harley-Davidson]] [[motorcycle]] and referred to everyone as \"me little lovelies\" &mdash; when she was not uttering her familiar threat: \"I'll rip yer bloody arms off!\", a phrase which immediately passed into the vernacular. The character was devised and played by the multi-talented [[Grahame Bond]] and was partly inspired by his overbearing Uncle Jack, whom he had disliked as a child,<ref>Rob Johnson & David Smiedt, ''Boom-boom! A Century of Australian Comedy'' (Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney, 1999), p.189</ref> his grandfather Ben Doyle and [[Dot Strong]] the ABC's last official tea lady.\n\n==Background==\nAn [[architecture]] graduate of [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]], Bond was already an accomplished writer, producer, comedian, singer, songwriter and guitarist by the time he graduated. He cut his teeth writing and performing as a founder member and leading light of the University's legendary Architecture Revues from 1964-69. It was here that he met and became friends with other Sydney students including [[Geoffrey Atherden]], [[Maurice Murphy (director)|Maurice Murphy]] and [[Peter Weir]], who became Australia's most internationally acclaimed film director. Through these stage revues Grahame also met his longtime musical, writing and acting partner [[Rory O'Donoghue]], who had begun his performing career playing [[The Artful Dodger]] in a Sydney production of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' as well as being the lead singer and guitarist in the Sydney rock bands [[The Pogs]] and [[Oakapple Day]]. Rory was only 14 at the time he met Bond, when The Pogs were brought in to provide musical backing for one of the Architecture Revues.\n\nAfter graduating, Grahame and friends continued working together on a wide range of projects in radio, theatre, TV and film. He collaborated on several short films and stage pieces with Peter Weir, and wrote and played in a number of stage comedies and revues. The success of Bond's work in the Architecture Revues led to a professional stage revue for the PACT Theatre Company, ''Balloon Dubloon'' (1969) with Peter Weir, which in turn led to an invitation from festival director [[Sir Robert Helpmann]] to stage a revue, ''Drip Dry Dreams'' at the [[Adelaide Festival]] and Richbrooke.\n\nThrough Bob Allnutt, a staffer at the [[PACT Theatre Company]] who also worked for the ABC's Religious Affairs Department, Weir, Bond and friends were commissioned to produce a TV special, ''[[Man On A Green Bike]]'', a fantasy that examined three different views of Christmas; this screened on ABC-TV at the end of December 1969. The 50-minute film, which was Bond's first known TV appearance, was co-written by and starred Bond and Peter Weir, with [[Geoff Malone]], James Dellit, and [[Anna Nygh]]. The story concerned three men, once friends sharing many adventures, who are now mayors of three cities\u2014medieval Ackley, the futuristic Cadmium, and Petal Lake, a community reminiscent of the 1930s. Into their midst comes the strange figure of Mr. Maloon, a man travelling on a heavily laden green bike, whose presence disturbs and embarrasses the mayors.<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.190</ref>\n\nDuring 1970 Bond, Weir and co. created and performed the revue ''Filth'' at the [[Phillip Street Theatre|Phillip St Revue]], followed by ''Hamlet On Ice'' at the [[Nimrod Theatre Company|Nimrod Theatre]]. Bond's friendship with Weir led to him writing the music for the three-part AFI Award-winning 1970 film ''[[Three To Go]]'' (in which he also had a small acting role), for which Weir directed one segment. Bond also provided the music and played a leading role in Weir's first film, the 1971 short feature ''[[Homesdale]]''.\n\n==Origin==\nAunty Jack was created for a proposed [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]] children's radio series, \"The Aunty Jack Show\", commissioned by [[Paddy Conroy]] (former head of ABC TV and now cable channel manager). It was intended to replace the long-running children's radio series ''[[Argonauts Club|The Argonauts Club]]'', which was about to be cancelled. The new series never went to air because ABC executives felt that the Aunty Jack character and some of Grahame's songs were \"inappropriate\" for young listeners.\n\nThe Aunty Jack character made her TV debut in ''Aunty Jack's Travelling Show'', an episode of ABC-TV's ''[[The Comedy Game]]'', broadcast in late 1971. It was originally to be called ''Aunty Jack's Travelling Abattoirs'' but ABC executives also found the title inappropriate. The program featured Bond, O'Donoghue and Derum, with Sharman Mellick and [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] in supporting roles.\n\nThis marked the start of a fruitful partnership between Bond, O'Donoghue and ABC writer, producer and director [[Maurice Murphy (director)|Maurice Murphy]]. They became the creative nucleus for a string of programs that strongly influenced TV comedy in Australia.\n\n==Influences==\nAlthough frequently compared to ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', as the two teams evidently shared the same love of [[surreal humour]], the Aunty Jack character appeared well before The British show was screened in Australia. [[The Goon Show|The Goons]] have also been mentioned as an inspiration, but in Johnson and Smiedt's history of Australian comedy ''Boom Boom'', Bond himself said that he had listened to The Goons only occasionally. He mentioned Australian radio star [[Jack Davey]], [[Bob Dyer]], ''the [[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' and ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' as early interests, but cited the surreal black humour of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' as a major comedic influence.<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.184</ref>\n\n[[Peter Weir]] was also involved behind the scenes in the early days of the series. He had been part of the university revues they had done together in the 1960s, and had a small part in ''Homesdale'' and was credited as a writer on the ''Aunty Jack's Travelling Show'' and four episodes of the subsequent series. He gave up performing just before ''The Aunty Jack Show'', saying in a later interview: \"We were very much in the vein of Monty Python, and I saw them in England and they were so superior to what we did\u2026 that was it. I told my writing partner I wanted to focus on films, I sold him my sketches and that was it. It was very difficult because he had just gotten a TV deal.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/01/peter-weir-shunned-stanley-kubrick-made-green-card-out-of-depression-10-things-learned-120966/|title=Peter Weir Shunned Stanley Kubrick, Made \u2018Green Card\u2019 Out Of Depression & 10 Things Learned\u2026 - IndieWire|first=Christopher|last=Bell|website=www.indiewire.com}}</ref>\n\nMaurice Murphy was a pivotal figure in this fertile era of Australian television comedy\u2014he oversaw ''Aunty Jack'' and its various spin-off series, and also acted as a vital buffer between the Aunty Jack creative team and the ABC's conservative management. [[Ted Robinson (TV director)|Ted Robinson]], then a young director, got his break working for Murphy on the second series of ''Aunty Jack''. Robinson later took over Murphy's mantle in the 1980s, producing some of the best Australian TV comedy series of the period, including ''[[The Big Gig]]'' and ''[[The Gillies Report]]''. Interviewed for ''Mouthing Off'', a history of Australian comedy, Robinson enthusiastically sang Murphy's praises:\n\n:\"When I was brought in to work on the second series of ''The Aunty Jack Show'', it was my first contact with television comedy, and I was amazed by the atmosphere of drive and energy that Maurice generated. He made it such an exciting time to be working in comedy because the creative climate under him was so open; nothing was considered too mad or bad or off-the-wall that it wouldn't be considered for broadcast. People like me were able to learn their craft 'on-air' in those days, which meant that we were able to make mistakes or even fail completely with programs and still have a job. Maurice encouraged us to take risks and experiment with comedy and I believe this resulted in some of the best and most innovative comedy ever seen on Australian television.\"\n\n''Aunty Jack's Travelling Show'' convinced the ABC to commission a short series, to be screened weekly. ''The Aunty Jack Show'' premiered on 16 November 1972 and became an immediate cult hit with younger audiences, although it was poorly received by critics. Some viewers found it too confronting, and according to Murphy, the ABC received hundreds of calls after the first episode, complaining about the violence, the \"bad language\" and especially about the [[drag (clothing)|drag]] aspect of the Aunty Jack character.\n\n==Public reaction and cancellation==\n[[File:Season1.jpg|208x208px|thumb| Flange Desire, Aunty Jack, Thin Arthur, and Narrator Neville in 1972]]\nThe adverse reaction was reportedly strong enough for the ABC to seriously consider taking the series off the air, but it is generally reported that impassioned pleas from the children of certain ABC executives saved the show from being cancelled. This would not be the team's last such run-in with management, however, and the tensions between the creative and bureaucratic elements in the ABC eventually came to a head with ''[[The Off Show]]'' in 1977.\n\nBond cancelled the show at the end of the second season by having Aunty Jack die of a heart attack, 'mortified' by the other cast members' 'dirty' language and content. Nevertheless, the cast was revived and returned for a special two years later to mark the inauguration of [[colour television]] in Australia on 1 March 1975. The special beat ABC's commercial rivals by beginning 3 minutes early, at 11:57 pm 28 February 1975 in black and white and then [[Wipe (transition)|wiping]] to colour at midnight.\n\n== Episodes ==\nTwo series of ''The Aunty Jack Show'' were made in 1972 and 1973 respectively. The first series comprised seven episodes, the second six episodes. There were also two specials, one aired 8 June 1973 before the second series began in October, and a second aired in 1975 and an unaired pilot, before the series started. Each episode was built around a central theme.\n\n=== Unaired pilot (1972) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Episode titles\n!Original TV broadcast dates<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|1\n|Aunty Jack's Travelling Show\n|Unaired\n|}\n\n=== Series one (1972) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Episode titles\n!Original TV broadcast dates<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/the-aunty-jack-show/episodes.html|title=Australian Television: The Aunty Jack Show: episode guide|website=www.australiantelevision.net|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n|-\n|1\n|Radio\n|16 November 1972\n|-\n|2\n|War\n|23 November 1972\n|-\n|3\n|Kulture\n|30 November 1972\n|-\n|4\n|Anonymous\n|7 December 1972\n|-\n|5\n|Family\n|14 December 1972\n|-\n|6\n|Sex\n|21 December 1972\n|-\n|7\n|Horror\n|28 December 1972\n|}\n\n=== Special (1973) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Episode titles\n!Original TV broadcast dates<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|1\n|Aunty Jack Rox On\n|8 June 1973\n|}\n\n=== Series two (1973) ===\n'''Regular cast''':\n:Aunty Jack - [[Grahame Bond]]\n:Kid Eager - [[Garry McDonald]]\n:Thin Arthur - [[Rory O'Donoghue]]\n:Flange Desire - Sandra McGregor\n\n{{Episode table |overall= |title= |airdate= |aux1=|aux1T = Length| aux2= | aux2T = [[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect ratio]]|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = {{vanchor|The Channel Nine Show}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|df=y|1973|10|25}}<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/the-aunty-jack-show/episodes.html|title=Australian Television: The Aunty Jack Show: episode guide|website=www.australiantelevision.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n| Aux1            = 30 minutes\n| Aux2            = 4:3\n| ShortSummary    = \nThe episode sees [[Nine Network|Channel 9]] launching a new-look Aunty Jack Show, starring Kid Eager as Aunty Jack.

All episodes featured segments with Aunty Jack and her sidekicks &mdash; Flange Desire (Sandra McGregor), Thin Arthur (Rory O'Donoghue) and, in the first season the Narrator Neville ([[John Derum]]) who was replaced in the second season by Kid Eager ([[Garry McDonald]]), a parodic amalgam of characters like [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]] and [[Ginger Meggs]]. There were also semi-regular appearances by the folk-singing duo Errol and Neil (Grahame & Rory), and rock'n'roll butcher Kev Kavanagh (Bond), a character that he had introduced (as \"Mr Kevin\") in Peter Weir's ''Homesdale''.\n\nDerum left the show after Series 1, wishing to pursue other interests. Derum appeared in archival footage in the special, Aunty Jack Rox On, and was replaced in Series 2 by a new cast member, [[Garry McDonald]], a talented young actor, comedian and musician, who had recently graduated from the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]]. His main role was as Aunty Jack's new sidekick, the cheeky, gum-chewing, freckle-faced Kid Eager. In one episode McDonald premiered a new character, devised by a viewer [[imdbname:2473486|Wendy Skelcher]] who had taken up a writing course and was inspired by the first episodes to write and submit scripts, which were welcomed by the team. This character featured only briefly in ''Aunty Jack'', but became much more prominent in the spin-off ''[[Wollongong the Brave]]'' as the Wollongong media 'un-personality' [[Norman Gunston]]. The Gunston character also appeared on the ''[[Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong]]'' LP and starred in the Logie-winning [[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]] parody, ''[[The Norman Gunston Show]]'', which premiered in 1975.\n\nSome of the sketches over the two series included the following:\n* ''Tarzan Superape'' (\"An origami rock opera\"), which parodied ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''\n* ''Dried Elephant Arrangements for Beginners'', in which Aunty Jack visits [[Taronga Zoo]] to teach viewers the fine art of \"elephanto reducioso\" with the reluctant assistance of Colin the elephant\n* Colonel Passionfruit, a campy military commander who led his squad of gay troops through a dangerous choreographed war with the help of The Pride Of Erin Mine Avoidance Tactic #III\n* [[country music|Country and eastern]] singers, The Farrelly Brothers, who performed a unique version of [[Leslie Morrison|Lucky Starr's]] \"[[I've Been Everywhere]]\" - but in this version the only places they had been were the NSW regional towns of [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] and [[Dapto, New South Wales|Dapto]] (Bond's home town)\n* ''Flat 1A 968 George St'' (a parody of popular 'sex and sin' soap opera ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'') in which viewers were promised \"lots of bottoms and lots of breasts\" - at which point two actors are shown, clad in multiple plastic 'joke' bottoms and breasts.\n\n==Feature film==\nA compilation of colour filmed segments from the first series was edited into an 85-minute feature ''The Very Best of The Aunty Jack Show'' which was screened at the 1973 [[Rose d'Or|Montreux Film Festival]]. It was not seen by Australian audiences until it was broadcast on ABC television on 26 January 1991.<ref>{{cite book|title=Directory of World Cinema: Australia and New Zealand 2|page=154|author=Ben Goldsmith and Geoff Lealand|publisher=Intellect|year=2015|isbn=1841506346}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Farewell Aunty Jack.jpg|250px|thumb|Aunty Jack and Thin Arthur from the picture disk Farewell Aunty Jack (1973)]] -->\nThe popularity of the series led to a one-off TV special, ''Aunty Jack Rox On'' with special guest [[Stevie Wright (Australian singer)|Stevie Wright]], a concert tour, a #1 hit single, \"[[Farewell Aunty Jack]]\" (a version of the closing theme of the series) and a best-selling album ''[[Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong]]'', released in early 1974. \"Farewell Aunty Jack\" was released as a single in December 1973, reached Number 1 on the Australian charts a week later, where it stayed for 3 weeks.  It was the first Australian single in picture-disc form to hit No.1 nationally, reputedly being the first disc of its kind in the world (although \"Goondiwindi Grey\" by Tex Morton in 1972 had also been issued in Australia as a picture disc too, but didn't hit the top spot nationally). \n\nBy the time Series 2 was underway Bond was already tired of Aunty Jack<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.222</ref> so he decided to kill her off in the final episode, \"The R-Certificate Show\" when, shocked by the gratuitous sex and nudity, Aunty Jack expires from a heart attack. Bond then departed for a much-needed holiday on [[Norfolk Island]] where, jointly inspired by the convict ruins and his holiday reading, [[Errol Flynn]]'s ''[[My Wicked Wicked Ways]]'', he came up with the concept for a new series set in the bushranger days, which became ''[[Flash Nick From Jindivik]]''.\n\nThe next outing for the classic Aunty Jack team was ''[[Wollongong the Brave]]'' (1974), a series of four one-hour specials that showcased favourite characters from the series. Episode 1 ''Aunty Jack'n'The Gong in Bloody Concert'' featured the core characters, augmented by a rock group. Episode 2 featured 'Country and Mediterranean' music group The Farelly Brothers and their singing sheep Jason; Episode 3 featured meat guru Kev Kavanagh and the final instalment ''Norman Gunston: The Golden Weeks'' eventually spawned ''The Norman Gunston Show'' in late 1975.\n\nAt 11:57 PM on Friday 28 February 1975, Aunty Jack, Thin Arthur, and Kid Eager introduced colour television broadcasting on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]], beating another channel's first colour program by deliberately starting three minutes early. The team's last major TV collaboration was the abortive comedy series ''[[The Off Show]]'' (1977) which was cancelled after only a few episodes following a controversial incident in which ABC executive Alan Batemen pulled the premiere episode from the schedule half an hour before it was due to air and then erased the tape, reportedly because he was offended by the [[Bill Harding]] religious parody sketch \"Leave It To Jesus\".<ref>Johnson & Smiedt, 1999, p.237</ref>\n\nAlthough fans long hoped that the show might be released on home video, it was more than thirty years after the show's first screening until this took place. Although there have been a number of reasons suggested, it is generally accepted that the major stumbling block was a long-running disagreement between Bond and the ABC, stemming from Bond and O'Donoghue's resentment over the presumed loss of several ''Aunty Jack'' episodes and the ''Off Show'' incident. Since Bond and O'Donoghue controlled the rights for all the original music featured in the series, their refusal to release them effectively kept the series off home video until 2005.\n\nFor many years there were persistent rumours\u2014fuelled by press statements from Bond himself\u2014that some episodes had been lost or destroyed. This was given added credence by the fact that (like the [[BBC]]) the ABC had undertaken an \"economy drive\" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which (it has been reported) that substantial portions of many shows were erased.\n\nAlthough (according to Bond<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiohaha.typepad.com/central/spike_milligan/|title=Radio Ha Ha|website=Radio Ha Ha}}</ref>) the original master tapes for three episodes were erased, all the original film footage shot for the missing episodes had survived and with the assistance of the [[National Archives of Australia]] the footage was located and restored, enabling the missing episodes to be reconstructed. The long-awaited release of the complete Series 1 on DVD took place in December 2005, and the complete Series 2 followed in April 2006. Although the master videotapes were monochrome, and the main episodes are presented in this format on DVD, much of the footage for the series was filmed in colour and these are included as alternate scenes.  The only episode in the entire Aunty Jack Show series not to be released on DVD was the 1973 special, 'Aunty Jack Rox On'.\n\nIn 2019, ''[[TV Week]]'' listed ''The Aunty Jack Show''  at #99 in its list of the 101 greatest Australian television shows of all time, which appeared in its monthly ''[[TV Week#TV Week Close Up|TV Week Close Up]]'' publication.  The magazine said the character's aggressive attitude, her golden boxing glove and her \"I'll rip yer bloody arms off\" catchprase quickly established her, and the show, as comedy icons.\n<ref>Burfitt, John; Cullen, Tamara; Hadley, Amy; Hockey, Maddison; Mitchell, Thomas; Recchi, Karina; Vnuk, Helen; Wang, Cynthia; Zubeidi, Zara (July 2019), 101 Greatest Aussie TV Shows of All Time, ''[[TV Week#TV Week Close Up|TV Week Close Up]]'', [[Bauer Media Group]].
