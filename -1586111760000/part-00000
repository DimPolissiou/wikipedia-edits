For instance, the first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region and India is the first Asian country to successfully launch a Mars orbiter (and the first country in the world to do so in its first attempt). At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  | title = China Denies There's an Asian Space Race\n  | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307440,00.html\n  | work = Fox News\n  | date = 2007-11-01\n  | access-date = 2008-02-29\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220065316/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307440,00.html\n  | archive-date = 2009-02-20\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}\n</ref>\nIn January 2007 China became the first Asian military-space power to send an [[anti-satellite]] missile into orbit, to destroy an aging Chinese Feng Yun 1C [[weather satellite]] in polar orbit.

The primary objective is to determine Mars' atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane. The spacecraft completed its journey on 24 September 2014 when it entered its intended orbit around Mars, making India the first Asian country to successfully place a Mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt. ISRO became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to Mars, only behind NASA, ROSCOSMOS, and ESA. China & India have tested their [[Anti-satellite weapon|anti- satellite weapons]] respectively in [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|2007]] and [[2019 Indian anti-satellite missile test|2019]], making them only countries after US & USSR/Russia to possess ASAT weapons.\n\nIn addition to increasing national pride, countries are commercially motivated to operate in space. Commercial satellites are launched for communications, weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. According to a report by the [[Space Frontier Foundation]] released in 2006, the \"space economy\" is estimated to be worth about $180&nbsp;billion, with more than 60% of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news\n | title = Shooting for the moon: The new space race\n | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/05/ww.spacerace/index.html | work=CNN | date=2007-10-10}}</ref> China and India propose the initiation of a commercial launch service.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Chinese space program|China National Space Administration}}\n[[Image:GPO comparison of Long March rockets.jpg|thumb|Several rockets of the Long March family]]\nChina has a space program with an independent [[human spaceflight]] capability.

On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with [[Chang'e 3]] Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]] and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so.<ref>Leonard David Space.com</ref> It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned [[space station]], starting with the launch of [[Tiangong 1]] and followed by [[Tiangong 2]] in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter ([[Yinghuo-1]]) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the [[Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover|2020 Chinese Mars Mission]] with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite news\n |title        = Programming glitch, not radiation or satellites, doomed Phobos-Grunt\n |url          = https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/07/phobos-grunt-programming-glitch\n |date         = 7 February 2012\n |accessdate   = 26 February 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120210215018/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/07/phobos-grunt-programming-glitch\n |archive-date = 10 February 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> China has collaborative projects with Russia, [[ESA]], and [[Brazil]], and has launched commercial satellites for other countries.

Early Chinese satellites, such as the [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW]] series, have undergone many [[atmospheric reentry]] tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration.

As the [[Space Race]] between the two superpowers culminated to human landing on the Moon, [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] decided on July 14, 1967 that the PRC should not be left behind, and therefore initiated China's own crewed space program. The top-secret Project 714 aimed to put two people into space by 1973 with the [[Shuguang spacecraft|Shuguang]] spacecraft. Nineteen [[PLAAF]] pilots were selected for this goal in March 1971. The Shuguang-1 spacecraft to be launched with the [[CZ-2A]] rocket was designed to carry a crew of two. The program was officially cancelled on May 13, 1972 for economic reasons, though the internal politics of the [[Cultural Revolution]] likely motivated the closure.\n\nThe short-lived second crewed program was based on the successful implementation of landing technology (third in the World after [[USSR]] and United States) by [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW satellite]]s. It was announced a few times in 1978 with the open publishing of some details including photos, but then was abruptly canceled in 1980. It has been argued that the second crewed program was created solely for propaganda purposes, and was never intended to produce results.<ref name=Astronautix>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/chie1978.htm|title=Chinese Crewed Capsule 1978|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-05-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AG9KTvIj?url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/chie1978.htm|archivedate=2012-08-28}} {{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/chidoors.htm |title=Encyclopedia Astronautica Index: 1 |accessdate=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AG9L3TY1?url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/chidoors.htm |archivedate=2012-08-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 under project 921, authorization and funding was given for the first phase, which was a plan to launch a crewed spacecraft. The Shenzhou program had four uncrewed test flights and two crewed missions. The first one was ''[[Shenzhou 1]]'' on November 20, 1999. On January 9, 2001 ''[[Shenzhou 2]]'' launched carrying test animals. ''[[Shenzhou 3]]'' and ''[[Shenzhou 4]]'' were launched in 2002, carrying test dummies. Following these was the successful ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'', China's first crewed mission in space on October 15, 2003, which carried [[Yang Liwei]] in orbit for 21 hours and made China the third nation to launch a human into orbit.\n\n==== Further continual ====\nThe second phase of the Project 921 started with ''[[Shenzhou 7]]'', China's first spacewalk mission. Then, two crewed missions were planned to the first Chinese space laboratory. The PRC initially designed the [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] with docking technologies imported from Russia, therefore compatible with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). On September 29, 2011, China launched [[Tiangong 1]]. This target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, a Long March 2F rocket lifted the [[Shenzhou 8]] uncrewed spacecraft which docked twice with the Tiangong 1 module. The [[Shenzhou 9]] craft took off on 16 June 2012 with a crew of 3. It successfully docked with the Tiangong-1 laboratory on 18 June 2012, at 06:07 UTC, marking China's first crewed spacecraft docking.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=Shenzhou-9 docks with Tiangong-1 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18481806 | work=BBC | date=18 June 2012 | accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> A larger basic permanent space station would be the third and last phase of Project 921.

The [[Hiten]] (Japanese: \"flying angel\") spacecraft (known before the launch as MUSES-A), built by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of Japan, was launched on 24 January 1990. In many ways, the mission did not go as was planned. [[SELENE|Kaguya]], the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft, was launched on 14 September 2007.\n\nChina launched its first lunar probe, [[Chang'e-1]], on 24 October 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 November 2007.\n\nIndia launched its first lunar probe, [[Chandrayaan-1]], on 22 October 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 November 2008. The mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface.\n\n==== Moon landings ====\n{{Main|Moon landing}}\nThe first confirmed Moon landing from Asia was Hiten's mission in 1993. An intentional hard landing at the end of the mission, some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/1994/ISASnews154.pdf|title=ISAS news No.154|language=Japanese|format=PDF}}</ref> Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the [[LUNAR-A]], developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian [[Luna-Glob]] program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are \"relatively\" hard landers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/lunar_a/index_e.html|title=Lunar exploration satellite \"LUNAR-A\" |work = Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|date = 2003}}</ref> but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.\n\nThe first Asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) released from [[Chandrayaan-1]] in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test was to be applied to future soft landings such as [[Chandrayaan-2]], planned for 2019. However, following successful orbital insertion, ISRO lost the contact with lander-rover module which was supposed to conduct soft landing on moon and only limited success could be accomplished. After accomplishment of [[Indian Human Spaceflight Programme|its first manned mission]], India has proposed space stations and manned missions to Moon in long term.<ref name=\"thequint.com\"/><ref>{{Cite news| title = India eying an indigenous station in space |url = https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/india-planning-to-have-own-space-station-isro-chief/article27897953.ece| date = June 13, 2019| accessdate = June 13, 2019| work =[[Business Line|The Hindu Business Line]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese Chang'e-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009, when China became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface. One purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings. A Chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the Chang'e-3 mission. With following [[Chang'e 4]], PRC became world's first country to land on the [[far side of the Moon]].

Japan was world's first country to launch a spacecraft on asteroids. JAXA's [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi probe]] was launched in 1998, but contact was lost with the probe due to electrical failures before visiting the planet Mars. The second Japanese probe for the planet Venus, [[Akatsuki (probe)|Akatsuki]], was launched in 2010. Akatsuki entered orbit around Venus on December 7, 2015. Together with [[European Space Agency]], [[JAXA]] has launched [[BepiColombo|Mio spacecraft]] to for mapping magnetic field of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Spacecraft will have flyby through [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] as well.\n\nChinese scientists expect that China will take 20&nbsp;years to launch independent planetary probes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zjdaily.zjol.com.cn/html/2009-06/08/content_4869055.htm|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a2\u6d4b\u706b\u661f\u8fd8\u970020\u5e74|publisher=\u6d59\u6c5f\u65e5\u62a5|language=Chinese|date=2009-06-08|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> The Chinese manned Mars exploration program is planned for around 2050 by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordchina.co.jp/group/g32328.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616082109/http://www.recordchina.co.jp/group/g32328.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-06-16|script-title=ja:2050\u5e74\u9803\u306b\u6709\u4eba\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u3092\u5b9f\u65bd\uff1d\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u304c\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u767a\u8868\u2015\u4e2d\u56fd|publisher=Recoed China|language=Japanese|date=2009-06-10|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref> After failed attempt to launch [[Yinghuo-1]], China is planning [[Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover|another Mars mission]] with an orbiter as well as rover.

For instance, the first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region and India is the first Asian country to successfully launch a Mars orbiter (and the first country in the world to do so in its first attempt). At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade.

The primary objective is to determine Mars' atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane. The spacecraft completed its journey on 24 September 2014 when it entered its intended orbit around Mars, making India the first Asian country to successfully place a Mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt. ISRO became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to Mars, only behind NASA, ROSCOSMOS, and ESA. China & India have tested their [[Anti-satellite weapon|anti- satellite weapons]] respectively in [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|2007]] and [[2019 Indian anti-satellite missile test|2019]], making them only countries after US & USSR/Russia to possess ASAT weapons.\n\nIn addition to increasing national pride, countries are commercially motivated to operate in space. Commercial satellites are launched for communications, weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. According to a report by the [[Space Frontier Foundation]] released in 2006, the \"space economy\" is estimated to be worth about $180&nbsp;billion, with more than 60% of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news\n | title = Shooting for the moon: The new space race\n | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/05/ww.spacerace/index.html | work=CNN | date=2007-10-10}}</ref> China and India propose the initiation of a commercial launch service.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Chinese space program|China National Space Administration}}\n[[Image:GPO comparison of Long March rockets.jpg|thumb|Several rockets of the Long March family]]\nChina has a space program with an independent [[human spaceflight]] capability.

In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned [[space station]], starting with the launch of [[Tiangong 1]] and followed by [[Tiangong 2]] in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter ([[Yinghuo-1]]) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the [[Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover|2020 Chinese Mars Mission]] with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite news\n |title        = Programming glitch, not radiation or satellites, doomed Phobos-Grunt\n |url          = https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/07/phobos-grunt-programming-glitch\n |date         = 7 February 2012\n |accessdate   = 26 February 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120210215018/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/07/phobos-grunt-programming-glitch\n |archive-date = 10 February 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> China has collaborative projects with Russia, [[ESA]], and [[Brazil]], and has launched commercial satellites for other countries.

Early Chinese satellites, such as the [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW]] series, have undergone many [[atmospheric reentry]] tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] in September 2008. China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in August 2011 and also the first probe to explore both Moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]].

As the [[Space Race]] between the two superpowers culminated to human landing on the Moon, [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] decided on July 14, 1967 that the PRC should not be left behind, and therefore initiated China's own crewed space program. The top-secret Project 714 aimed to put two people into space by 1973 with the [[Shuguang spacecraft|Shuguang]] spacecraft. Nineteen [[PLAAF]] pilots were selected for this goal in March 1971. The Shuguang-1 spacecraft to be launched with the [[CZ-2A]] rocket was designed to carry a crew of two. The program was officially cancelled on May 13, 1972 for economic reasons, though the internal politics of the [[Cultural Revolution]] likely motivated the closure.\n\nThe short-lived second crewed program was based on the successful implementation of landing technology (third in the World after [[USSR]] and United States) by [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW satellite]]s. It was announced a few times in 1978 with the open publishing of some details including photos, but then was abruptly canceled in 1980. It has been argued that the second crewed program was created solely for propaganda purposes, and was never intended to produce results.<ref name=Astronautix>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/chie1978.htm|title=Chinese Crewed Capsule 1978|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-05-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AG9KTvIj?url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/chie1978.htm|archivedate=2012-08-28}} {{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/chidoors.htm |title=Encyclopedia Astronautica Index: 1 |accessdate=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AG9L3TY1?url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/chidoors.htm |archivedate=2012-08-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 under project 921, authorization and funding was given for the first phase, which was a plan to launch a crewed spacecraft. The Shenzhou program had four uncrewed test flights and two crewed missions. The first one was ''[[Shenzhou 1]]'' on November 20, 1999. On January 9, 2001 ''[[Shenzhou 2]]'' launched carrying test animals. ''[[Shenzhou 3]]'' and ''[[Shenzhou 4]]'' were launched in 2002, carrying test dummies. Following these was the successful ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'', China's first crewed mission in space on October 15, 2003, which carried [[Yang Liwei]] in orbit for 21 hours and made China the third nation to launch a human into orbit.\n\n==== Further continual ====\nThe second phase of the Project 921 started with ''[[Shenzhou 7]]'', China's first spacewalk mission. Then, two crewed missions were planned to the first Chinese space laboratory. The PRC initially designed the [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] with docking technologies imported from Russia, therefore compatible with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). On September 29, 2011, China launched [[Tiangong 1]]. This target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, a Long March 2F rocket lifted the [[Shenzhou 8]] uncrewed spacecraft which docked twice with the Tiangong 1 module. The [[Shenzhou 9]] craft took off on 16 June 2012 with a crew of 3. It successfully docked with the Tiangong-1 laboratory on 18 June 2012, at 06:07 UTC, marking China's first crewed spacecraft docking.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=Shenzhou-9 docks with Tiangong-1 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18481806 | work=BBC | date=18 June 2012 | accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref> A larger basic permanent space station would be the third and last phase of Project 921.

The [[Hiten]] (Japanese: \"flying angel\") spacecraft (known before the launch as MUSES-A), built by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of Japan, was launched on 24 January 1990. In many ways, the mission did not go as was planned. [[SELENE|Kaguya]], the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft, was launched on 14 September 2007.\n\nChina launched its first lunar probe, [[Chang'e-1]], on 24 October 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 November 2007.\n\nIndia launched its first lunar probe, [[Chandrayaan-1]], on 22 October 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 November 2008. The mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface.\n\n==== Moon landings ====\n{{Main|Moon landing}}\nThe first confirmed Moon landing from Asia was Hiten's mission in 1993. An intentional hard landing at the end of the mission, some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/1994/ISASnews154.pdf|title=ISAS news No.154|language=Japanese|format=PDF}}</ref> Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the [[LUNAR-A]], developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian [[Luna-Glob]] program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are \"relatively\" hard landers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/lunar_a/index_e.html|title=Lunar exploration satellite \"LUNAR-A\" |work = Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|date = 2003}}</ref> but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.\n\nThe first Asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) released from [[Chandrayaan-1]] in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test was to be applied to future soft landings such as [[Chandrayaan-2]], planned for 2019. However, following successful orbital insertion, ISRO lost the contact with lander-rover module which was supposed to conduct soft landing on moon and only limited success could be accomplished. After accomplishment of [[Indian Human Spaceflight Programme|its first manned mission]], India has proposed space stations and manned missions to Moon in long term.<ref name=\"thequint.com\"/><ref>{{Cite news| title = India eying an indigenous station in space |url = https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/india-planning-to-have-own-space-station-isro-chief/article27897953.ece| date = June 13, 2019| accessdate = June 13, 2019| work =[[Business Line|The Hindu Business Line]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese Chang'e-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009, when China became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface. One purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings. A Chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the Chang'e-3 mission. With following [[Chang'e 4]], PRC became world's first country to land on the [[far side of the Moon]]. China also aims to undertake a manned Moon landing by the late 2020s.<ref>{{cite web |title=China to build moon station in 'about 10 years' |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-to-build-moon-station-in-about-10-years/ar-BBWeJKe |website=MSN|agency = AFP|date = 24 April 2019|archivedate = 24 April 2019 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20190424104632/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-to-build-moon-station-in-about-10-years/ar-BBWeJKe }}</ref>\n\n=== Exploration of the major planets ===\nJapanese interplanetary probes have been mostly limited to [[Small Solar System bodies]] such as [[comets]] and [[asteroids]].

She made her initial impact in the 1950s from her [[improvisational comedy]] routines with [[Mike Nichols]], performing as [[Nichols and May]]. After her duo with Nichols ended, May subsequently developed a career as a director and screenwriter.\n\nHer screenwriting has been twice nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], for [[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|''Heaven Can Wait'']] (1978) and [[Primary Colors (film)|''Primary Colors'']] (1998) which was directed by Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elaine-may-honor-writers-guild-1201682905/|title=Elaine May Honored by Writers Guild of America|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref> May is celebrated for the string of films she directed in the 1970s: her 1971 black comedy ''[[A New Leaf (film)|A New Leaf]]'', in which she also starred; her 1972 dark romantic comedy ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''; and her 1976 gritty drama ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]'', starring [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Peter Falk]]. In 1996, she reunited with Nichols to write the screenplay for ''[[The Birdcage]]'', directed by Nichols.\n\nAfter studying acting with theater coach [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] in Los Angeles, she moved to Chicago in 1955 and became a founding member of the [[Compass Players]], an improvisational theater group. May began working alongside Nichols, who was also in the group, and together they began writing and performing their own comedy sketches, which were enormously popular. In 1957 they both quit the group to form their own stage act, [[Nichols and May]], in New York. [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who produced most of [[Woody Allen]]'s films, said their act was \"so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|340}}\n\nThey performed nightly to mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making TV appearances and radio broadcasts. In their comedy act, they created satirical clich\u00e9s and character types which made fun of the new intellectual, cultural, and social order that was just emerging at the time. In doing so, she was instrumental in removing the stereotype of women being unable to succeed at live comedy. Together, they became an inspiration to many younger comedians, including [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Steve Martin]]. After four years, at the height of their fame, they decided to discontinue their act. May became a screenwriter and playwright, along with acting and directing. Their relatively brief time together as comedy stars led New York talk show host [[Dick Cavett]] to call their act \"one of the comic meteors in the sky.\"  [[Woody Allen]] declared, \u201cthe two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/nichols-and-may-reunion-exclusive | title=Exclusive: The Reunion of Mike Nichols and Elaine May}}</ref> [[Gerald Nachman]] noted that \"Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|319}}\n\nIn 2018, May returned to Broadway after a 60 year absence in [[Lila Neugebauer]]'s revival of [[Kenneth Lonergan]]'s play ''[[The Waverly Gallery]]'' which ran at the [[John Golden Theatre]], the same theatre where Nichols and May started almost 60 years ago.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/person/elaine-may-vault-0000025321 Elaine May] Playbill (vault)</ref> May received rapturous reviews for her performance, and won a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/theater/review-waverly-gallery-elaine-may-kenneth-lonergan.html \"Theater Review.

Rubinfine; they remained married until his death in 1982.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|332}}\n\nMay's longtime companion was director [[Stanley Donen]], whom she dated from 1999 until his death in 2019.<ref name=Feeney>{{cite journal | author = Feeney, Mark | year = 2009 | title = Like His Films, Donen Exudes Style and Wit | journal = [[The Boston Globe]] | issue = October 4 | format = online | pages = 1\u20133, esp. 3 | url = http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/10/04/stanley_donen_visits_town_this_week_during_a_retrospective_at_harvard_film_archive/?page=1 | access-date = 31 January 2016 | quote = Subtitle: Famed director Stanley Donen, the subject of a retrospective at the Harvard Film Archive, visits this week.}}</ref> Donen said he proposed marriage \"about 172 times\".<ref name=Heilpern09>{{cite journal | author = Heilpern, John | others = Tim Shaeffer, illustrations | year = 2013 | title = Hollywood Conversations: Out to Lunch with Stanley Donen | journal = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | issue = February 28 (March, print) | format = online, print |page =  | url = https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/stanley-donan-singin-in-the-rain | access-date = 31 January 2016 | quote = Subtitle: The last of the golden-age Hollywood directors still believes in romance.}}</ref>\n\n==Stage career==\nAfter her marriage to Marvin May, she studied acting with former [[Moscow Art Theatre]] coach [[Maria Ouspenskaya]]. She also held odd jobs during that period and tried to enroll in college. She learned, however, that colleges in California require a high school diploma to apply, which she did not have.<ref name=Quart/>{{rp|39}} After finding out that the [[University of Chicago]] was one of the few colleges that would accept students without diplomas, she set out with $7 and hitchhiked to Chicago.<ref name=Life/>\n\nSoon after moving to Chicago in 1950, May began informally taking classes at the university by [[Academic audit|auditing]], sitting in without enrolling. She nevertheless sometimes engaged in discussions with instructors. [[Mike Nichols]], who was then an actor in the school's theatrical group, remembers her coming to his philosophy class, making \"outrageous\" comments, and leaving.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|324}} They learned about each other from friends, eventually being introduced after one of his stage shows. Six weeks later, they bumped into each other at a train station in Chicago and soon began spending time together over the following weeks as \"dead-broke theatre junkies.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|324f}}\n\n===The Compass Players===\nIn 1955, May joined a new, off-campus improvisational theater group in Chicago, The [[Compass Players]], becoming one of its charter members. The group was founded by [[Paul Sills]] and [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]]. Nichols later joined the group, wherein he resumed his friendship with May. At first he was unable to improvise well on stage, but with inspiration from May, they began developing improvised comedy sketches together.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|333}} Nichols remembered this period:\n\n{{quote|From then on it became mostly pleasure because of Elaine's generosity. The fact of Elaine\u2014her presence\u2014kept me going. She was the only one who had faith in me. I loved it... We had a similar sense of humor and irony... When I was with her I became something more than I had been before.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|333}} }}\n\nActress [[Geraldine Page]] recalled they worked together with great efficiency, \"like a juggernaut.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|336}} Thanks in part to Nichols and May, the Compass Players became an enormously popular satirical comedy troupe. They helped the group devise new stage techniques to adapt the freedom they had during the workshop.<ref name=Seham>{{cite book | author = Seham, Amy E. | year = 2001 | chapter = The First-Wave Paradigm (Chapter 1)  | pages = 11, 14\u201316, 229 | title = Whose Improv Is It Anyway?: Beyond Second City | location = Jackson, MS, USA | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=160473759X | isbn = 160473759X | access-date = 31 January 2016  | quote = }}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n\n[[File:Elaine May Mike Nichols Dorothy Loudon Laugh Line 1959.JPG|thumb|left|240px|May, Nichols and Dorothy Loudon, 1959]]\nMay became prominent as a member of the Compass's acting group, a quality others in the group observed. Bobbi Gordon, an actor, remembers that she was often the center of attention: \"The first time I met her was at Compass... Elaine was this grande dame of letters. With people sitting around her feet, staring up at her, open-mouthed in awe, waiting for 'The Word'.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330f}} A similar impression struck Compass actor Bob Smith:\n\n{{quote|May would hold court, discussing her days as a child actor in the Yiddish theater, as men hung on her every word. Every guy who knew her was in love with her. You'd have been stupid not to have been.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}} }}\n\nAs an integral member of their group, May was open to giving novices a chance, including the hiring of a black actor and generally making the group \"more democratic\". And by observing her high level of performance creativity, everyone's work was improved.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330}} \"She was the strongest woman I ever met,\" adds Compass actor Nancy Ponder.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330}}\n\nIn giving all her attention to acting, however, she neglected her home life. Fellow actress [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] recalled that May lived in a cellar with only one piece of furniture, a ping-pong table. \"She wore basic beatnik black and, like her film characters, was a brilliant disheveled klutz.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330}}\n\nBecause she was physically attractive, some members of the group, including Nichols, became distracted during workshops. Group actor Omar Shapli was \"struck by her piercing, dark-eyed, sultry stare. It was really unnerving,\" he says.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}} Nichols remembers that \"everybody wanted Elaine, and the people who got her couldn't keep her.\" Theater critic [[John Lahr]] agrees, noting that \"her juicy good looks were a particularly disconcerting contrast to her sharp tongue.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}}\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=\"Elaine was too formidable, one of the most intelligent, beautiful, and witty women I had ever met. I hoped I would never see her again.\"|source=[[Richard Burton]]<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|331}}}}\n\nMay's sense of humor, including what she found funny about everyday life, was different from others' in the group. Novelist [[Herbert Gold]], who dated May, says that \"she treated everything funny that men take seriously... She was never serious. Her life was a narrative.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}} Another ex-boyfriend, James Sacks, says that \"Elaine had a genuine beautiful madness.\" Nevertheless, states Gold, \"she was very cute, a lot like [[Debra Winger]], just a pretty Jewish girl.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}}\n\nShe was considered highly intelligent. \"She's about fifty percent more brilliant than she needs to be,\" says actor Eugene Troobnick. Those outside their theater group sometimes noticed that same quality. British actor [[Richard Burton]], who was married to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] at the time, agreed with that impression after he first met May while he was starring in ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' on Broadway.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|331}}\n\n===Nichols and May comedy team===\n[[File:Elaine May and Mike Nichols 1960.JPG|thumb|Nichols and May, 1960]]\nNichols was personally asked to leave the Compass Players in 1957 because he and May became too good, which threw the company off balance, noted club manager Jay Landsman. Nichols was told he had too much talent.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|338}} Nichols then left the group in 1957, with May quitting with him. They next formed their own stand-up comedy team, [[Nichols and May]]. After contacting some agents in New York, they were asked to audition for [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who would later become [[Woody Allen]]'s manager and executive producer. Rollins said he was stunned by how good their act was:\n\n{{quote|Their work was so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were, actually as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy... They were totally adventurous and totally innocent, in a certain sense. That's why it was accepted. They would uncover little dark niches that you felt but had never expressed... I'd never seen this technique before. I thought, My God, these are two people writing hilarious comedy on their feet!<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|340}} }}\n\nBy 1960, they made their Broadway debut with ''An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May'', which later won a Grammy. After performing their act a number of years in New York's various clubs, and then on Broadway, with most of the shows sold out, Nichols could not believe their success:\n{{quote|We were winging it, making it up as we went along. It never even crossed our minds that it had any value beyond the moment. It was great to study and learn and work there. We were ''stunned'' when we got to New York... Never for a moment did we consider that we would do this for a living. It was just a handy way to make some money until we grew up.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|333}} }}\n\nHis feelings were shared by May, who was also taken aback by their success, especially having some real income after living in near-poverty. She told a ''Newsweek'' interviewer, \"When we came to New York, we were practically barefoot. And I still can't get used to walking in high heels.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|343}}\n\nThe uniqueness of their act made them an immediate success in New York. Their style became the \"next big thing\" in live comedy. [[Charles H. Joffe]], their producer, remembers that sometimes the line to their show went around the block. That partly explains why [[Milton Berle]], a major television comedy star, tried three times without success to see their act.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|341}} Critic Lawrence Christon recalls his first impression after seeing their act: \"You just knew it was a defining moment. They caught the urban tempo, like Woody Allen did.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|343}} They performed nightly at mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making TV program and commercial<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziahbVD5Y5o|title=Elaine May & Mike Nichols Commercial (stock footage / archival footage)|last=FilmArchivesNYC|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=29 July 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZc0jL6QMgU|title=Elaine May and Mike Nichols on Tax Day|last=Oscars|date=15 April 2016|accessdate=29 July 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> appearances and radio broadcasts.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|346}}\n\n===Technique===\n[[File:Nichols and May - 1961.jpg|thumb|Theater program from 1961]]\nAmong the qualities of their act, which according to one writer made them a rarity, was that they used both \"snob and mob appeal,\" which gave them a wide audience. Nachman explains that they presented a new kind of comedy team, unlike previous comedy duos which had an intelligent member alongside a much less intelligent one, as with [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Fibber McGee and Molly]], [[Burns and Allen]], [[Abbott and Costello]], and [[Martin and Lewis]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|322}}\n\nWhat differentiated their style was the fact that their stage performance created \"scenes,\" a method very unlike the styles of other acting teams. Nor did they rely on fixed gender or comic roles, but instead adapted their own character to fit a sketch idea they came up with. They chose real-life subjects, often from their own life, which were made into satirical and funny vignettes.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|322}}\n\nThis was accomplished by using subtle joke references which they correctly expected their audiences to recognize, whether through clich\u00e9s or character types. They thereby indirectly poked fun at the new intellectual culture which they saw growing around them. They felt that young Americans were taking themselves too seriously, which became the subject of much of their satire.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|321}}\n\nNichols structured the material for their skits, and May came up with most of their ideas.<ref name=Life/> Improvisation became a fairly simple art for them, as they portrayed the urban couple's \"Age of Anxiety\" in their sketches, and did so on their feet.<ref name=KashnerVanFair08>{{cite journal | author = Kashner, Sam | year = 2008 | title = The Movies: Here\u2019s to You, Mr. Nichols, The Making of The Graduate | journal = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | issue = February 29 | format = online, print | page = | url = https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/graduate200803 | access-date = 31 January 2016 | quote = }} Reprinted in Graydon Carter's ''Vanity Fair's Tales of Hollywood: Rebels, Reds, and Graduates,'', New York, NT, USA: Penguin, p. 169ff.</ref> According to May, it was simple: {{quote|It's nothing more than quickly creating a situation between two people and throwing up some kind of problem for one of them.<ref name=Life/>}}\n\nNichols notes that after coming up with a sketch idea, they would perform it soon after with little extra rehearsal or writing it down. One example he remembered was inspired simply from a phone call from his mother. I called Elaine and I said, \"I've got a really good piece for us tonight.\" They created a six-minute-long, mostly improvised, \"mother and son\" sketch, which they performed later that night.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|335}}<ref name=MotherSon1960>{{cite AV media | people = Nichols, Mike & May, Elaine, acting; Arthur Penn, producer | year = 1998 | orig-year = 1960 | chapter = Mother and Son [track 4] | title = An Evening With Mike Nichols And Elaine May ''(Original Cast Recording)'' |medium=  audio CD [vinyl] | asin = B000007Q8O | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKL1tNv__kU | access-date= 31 January 2016 | format = | time = | location= New York, NY, USA [Chicago, IL, USA] | publisher= PolyGram Records [Mercury Records] | id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nMay helped remove the stereotype of women's roles on stage. Producer [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]] notes that she accomplished that partly by not choosing traditional 1950s female roles for her characters, which were often housewives or women working at menial jobs. Instead, she often played the character of a sophisticated woman, such as a doctor, a psychiatrist, or an employer.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|337}} Shepherd notes that \"Elaine broke through the psychological restrictions of playing comedy as a woman.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|322}}\n\nNichols and May did have different attitudes toward their improvisations, however. Where Nichols always needed to know where a sketch was going and what its ultimate point would be, May preferred exploring ideas as the scene progressed. May says that even when they repeated their improvisations, it was not rote but came from re-creating her original impulse. Such improvisational techniques allowed her to make slight changes during a performance.<ref name=Life/> Although May had a wider improvisational range than Nichols, he was generally the one to shape the pieces and steer them to their end. For their recordings, he also made the decision of what to delete.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|323}}\n\n===Influence===\nNichols and May created a new \"Age of Irony\" for comedy, which showed actors arguing contemporary banalities as a key part of their routine. That style of comedy was picked up and further developed by later comics such as [[Steve Martin]], [[Bill Murray]], and [[David Letterman]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|323}} According to Martin, Nichols and May were among the first to satirize relationships. The word \"relationship,\" notes Martin, was first used in the early sixties: \"It was the first time I ever heard it satirized.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|323}} He recalls that soon after discovering their recorded acts, he went to sleep each night listening to them. \"They influenced us all and changed the face of comedy.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|324}}\n\nIn ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Woody Allen]] declared, \"\u201cIndividually, each one is a genius, and when they worked together, the sum was even greater than the combination of the parts\u2014the two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level\".<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/nichols-and-may-reunion-exclusive</ref>\n\n[[Lily Tomlin]] was also affected by their routines and considers May to be her inspiration as a comedian: \"There was nothing like Elaine May, with her voice, her timing, and her attitude,\" says Tomlin.<ref name=Lavin88>{{cite book | author = Lavin, Suzanne | year = 2004 | chapter = Overview (Chapter 1) | pages = 2, 9f, 43 | title = Women and Comedy in Solo Performance: Phyllis Diller, Lily Tomlin and Roseanne | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Routledge-Taylor & Francis | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0203643461 | isbn = 0203643461 | access-date = 31 January 2016 | quote = }}</ref>{{rp|43}} \"The nuances of the characterizations and the cultured types that they were doing completely appealed to me.

However, at the height of their fame, they decided to discontinue their act that year and took their careers in different directions: Nichols became a leading Broadway stage and film director; May became primarily a screenwriter and playwright, with some acting and directing. Among the reasons they decided to call it quits was that keeping their act fresh was becoming more difficult. Nichols explains:\n{{quote|Several things happened. One was that I, more than Elaine, became more and more afraid of our improvisational material. She was always brave. We never wrote a skit, we just sort of outlined it: I'll try to make you, or we'll fight\u2014whatever it was. We found ourselves doing the same material over and over, especially in our Broadway show. This took a great toll on Elaine.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|349}}}}\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=\"Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era.

No one could touch them.\"|source=Author [[Gerald Nachman]]<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|319}}}}\n\nNichols said that for him personally the breakup was \"cataclysmic\", and he went into a state of depression: \"I didn't know what I was or who I was.\" It was not until 1996, thirty-five years later, that they would work together again as a team, when she wrote the screenplay and he directed ''The Birdcage.'' It \"was like coming home, like getting a piece of yourself back that you thought you'd lost,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|353}} He adds that May had been very important to him from the moment he first saw her,<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|325}} adding that for her \"improv was innate,\" and few people have that gift.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|359}}\n\nDirector [[Arthur Penn]] said of their sudden breakup, \"They set the standard and then they had to move on.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|351}} To New York talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], \"They were one of the comic meteors in the sky.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|348}}\n\nThey reunited for benefits for [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|George McGovern for President]] in 1972.\n\n=== Playwriting ===\nFollowing the break-up, May wrote several plays. Her greatest success was the one-act ''Adaptation''. Other stage plays she has written include ''Not Enough Rope'', ''Mr Gogol and Mr Preen'', ''Hotline'' (which was performed off-Broadway in 1995 as part of the anthology play ''Death Defying Acts''), ''[[After the Night and the Music]]'', ''Power Plays'', ''Taller Than A Dwarf'', ''The Way of All Fish'', and ''Adult Entertainment''. In 1969 she directed the off-Broadway production of ''Adaptation/[[Next (play)|Next]]''.\n\nIn 2002 [[Stanley Donen]] directed her musical play ''Adult Entertainment'' with [[Jeannie Berlin]] and [[Danny Aiello]] at Variety Arts Theater in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=BrantleyNYT02>{{cite journal | author = Brantley, Ben | year = 2002 | title = Theater Review: Is She a Serious Actress?

(Ritchie would later retitle the story ''A New Leaf''.) The unconventional 'romance' starred [[Walter Matthau]] as a Manhattan bachelor faced with bankruptcy and May herself as the wealthy but nerdy botanist he cynically romances and marries in order to salvage his extravagant lifestyle. Director May originally submitted a 180-minute work to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], but the studio cut it back by nearly 80 minutes for release.\n\nMay quickly followed up her debut film with 1972's ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''. She limited her role to directing, using a screenplay by [[Neil Simon]], based on a story by Bruce Jay Friedman. The film starred [[Charles Grodin]], [[Cybill Shepherd]], [[Eddie Albert]], and May's own daughter, [[Jeannie Berlin]]. It was a major critical success (holding a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes). It is listed at #91 in the AFI's 100 funniest movies of all time.\n\nMay's career then suffered a major setback. She followed up her two comedies by writing and directing a bleak crime drama entitled ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]'', starring [[Peter Falk]] and [[John Cassavetes]]. Budgeted at $1.8 million and scheduled for a summer 1975 release, the film ended up costing $4.3 million and not coming out until December 1976. She was eventually fired by [[Paramount Pictures]] (the studio which financed the film), but succeeded in getting herself rehired by hiding two reels of the negative until the studio gave in. The film's subsequent failure at the box office damaged her career in Hollywood and she did not direct again for a decade.\n\nIt was [[Warren Beatty]] who decided to give her one more chance. They collaborated on ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' (1987), starring Beatty and [[Dustin Hoffman]]. Largely shot on location in [[Morocco]], the production was beset by creative differences among the principals and had cost overruns. Long before the picture was ready for release, the troubled production had become the subject of numerous press stories, including a long cover article in New York Magazine. The advance publicity was largely negative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ishtar/critic-reviews|title=Ishtar|publisher=Metacritic}}</ref> and, despite some positive reviews from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the film was a critical failure.\n\nMay did not direct another film for 29 years, when she directed the TV documentary ''[[Mike Nichols: American Masters]]'' in 2016.<ref>[http://thefilmstage.com/news/watch-elaine-mays-american-masters-documentary-on-mike-nichols/ \"Elaine May\u2019s \u2018American Masters\u2019 Documentary on Mike Nichols\"], ''The Film Stage'', Feb. 1, 2016</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn addition to writing three of the films she directed, Elaine May received an Oscar nomination for updating the 1941 film ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' as ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978). She contributed (uncredited) to the screenplay for the 1982 megahit ''[[Tootsie]]'', notably the scenes involving the character played by [[Bill Murray]]. She also contributed to the screenplay for ''[[Dangerous Minds]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unpacking the short but prickly filmography of Elaine May|url=https://film.avclub.com/unpacking-the-short-but-prickly-filmography-of-elaine-m-1798235875|work=AV Club|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay reunited with her former comic partner, [[Mike Nichols]], for an American adaptation of ''[[The Birdcage]]'' in 1996. The film relocated the classic French farce ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' from France to [[South Beach]], Miami. May received her second Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay when she again worked with Nichols on ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' in 1997.\n\nIn December 2013 Stanley Donen was in pre-production for a new film co-written with May, to be produced by Mike Nichols. A [[read-through|table reading]] of the script for potential investors included such actors as [[Christopher Walken]], [[Charles Grodin]], [[Ron Rifkin]], and Jeannie Berlin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2013/12/10/stanley-donen-gearing-up-to-direct-his-first-feature-in-30-years-1196501|title=Stanley Donen gearing up to direct his first feature in 30 years|accessdate=December 14, 2013|publisher=moviepilot.com|date=December 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017004556/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2013/12/10/stanley-donen-gearing-up-to-direct-his-first-feature-in-30-years-1196501|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Nichols died in 2014, however, and nothing further has been reported about this project.\n\n===Acting===\nMay has also acted in comedy films, including ''[[Enter Laughing (film)|Enter Laughing]]'' (1967), directed by [[Carl Reiner]], and ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), costarring [[Peter Falk]] and [[Jack Lemmon]]. The latter film was not well received by critics, although Lemmon said he enjoyed working alongside May: \"She's the finest actress I've ever worked with,\" he said. \"And I've never expressed an opinion about a leading lady before... I think Elaine is touched with genius.

After her duo with Nichols ended, May subsequently developed a career as a director and screenwriter.\n\nHer screenwriting has been twice nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], for [[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|''Heaven Can Wait'']] (1978) and [[Primary Colors (film)|''Primary Colors'']] (1998) which was directed by Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elaine-may-honor-writers-guild-1201682905/|title=Elaine May Honored by Writers Guild of America|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref> May is celebrated for the string of films she directed in the 1970s: her 1971 black comedy ''[[A New Leaf (film)|A New Leaf]]'', in which she also starred; her 1972 dark romantic comedy ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''; and her 1976 gritty drama ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]'', starring [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Peter Falk]]. In 1996, she reunited with Nichols to write the screenplay for ''[[The Birdcage]]'', directed by Nichols.\n\nAfter studying acting with theater coach [[Maria Ouspenskaya]] in Los Angeles, she moved to Chicago in 1955 and became a founding member of the [[Compass Players]], an improvisational theater group. May began working alongside Nichols, who was also in the group, and together they began writing and performing their own comedy sketches, which were enormously popular. In 1957 they both quit the group to form their own stage act, [[Nichols and May]], in New York. [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who produced most of [[Woody Allen]]'s films, said their act was \"so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|340}}\n\nThey performed nightly to mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making TV appearances and radio broadcasts. In their comedy act, they created satirical clich\u00e9s and character types which made fun of the new intellectual, cultural, and social order that was just emerging at the time. In doing so, she was instrumental in removing the stereotype of women being unable to succeed at live comedy. Together, they became an inspiration to many younger comedians, including [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Steve Martin]]. After four years, at the height of their fame, they decided to discontinue their act. May became a screenwriter and playwright, along with acting and directing. Their relatively brief time together as comedy stars led New York talk show host [[Dick Cavett]] to call their act \"one of the comic meteors in the sky.\" [[Gerald Nachman]] noted that \"Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|319}}\n\nIn 2018, May returned to Broadway after a 60 year absence in [[Lila Neugebauer]]'s revival of [[Kenneth Lonergan]]'s play ''[[The Waverly Gallery]]'' which ran at the [[John Golden Theatre]], the same theatre where Nichols and May started almost 60 years ago.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/person/elaine-may-vault-0000025321 Elaine May] Playbill (vault)</ref> May received rapturous reviews for her performance, and won a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/theater/review-waverly-gallery-elaine-may-kenneth-lonergan.html \"Theater Review.

They had one child, [[Jeannie Berlin]] (born 1949), who became an actress and screenwriter. The couple divorced in 1960, and she married lyricist [[Sheldon Harnick]] in 1962; they divorced a year later. In 1964, May married her psychoanalyst, David L.

She also held odd jobs during that period and tried to enroll in college. She learned, however, that colleges in California require a high school diploma to apply, which she did not have.<ref name=Quart/>{{rp|39}} After finding out that the [[University of Chicago]] was one of the few colleges that would accept students without diplomas, she set out with $7 and hitchhiked to Chicago.<ref name=Life/>\n\nSoon after moving to Chicago in 1950, May began informally taking classes at the university by [[Academic audit|auditing]], sitting in without enrolling. She nevertheless sometimes engaged in discussions with instructors. [[Mike Nichols]], who was then an actor in the school's theatrical group, remembers her coming to his philosophy class, making \"outrageous\" comments, and leaving.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|324}} They learned about each other from friends, eventually being introduced after one of his stage shows.

The group was founded by [[Paul Sills]] and [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]]. Nichols later joined the group, wherein he resumed his friendship with May. At first he was unable to improvise well on stage, but with inspiration from May, they began developing improvised comedy sketches together.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|333}} Nichols remembered this period:\n\n{{quote|From then on it became mostly pleasure because of Elaine's generosity.

They helped the group devise new stage techniques to adapt the freedom they had during the workshop.<ref name=Seham>{{cite book | author = Seham, Amy E. | year = 2001 | chapter = The First-Wave Paradigm (Chapter 1)  | pages = 11, 14\u201316, 229 | title = Whose Improv Is It Anyway?: Beyond Second City | location = Jackson, MS, USA | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=160473759X | isbn = 160473759X | access-date = 31 January 2016  | quote = }}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n\n[[File:Elaine May Mike Nichols Dorothy Loudon Laugh Line 1959.JPG|thumb|left|240px|May, Nichols and Dorothy Loudon, 1959]]\nMay became prominent as a member of the Compass's acting group, a quality others in the group observed. Bobbi Gordon, an actor, remembers that she was often the center of attention: \"The first time I met her was at Compass... Elaine was this grande dame of letters. With people sitting around her feet, staring up at her, open-mouthed in awe, waiting for 'The Word'.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330f}} A similar impression struck Compass actor Bob Smith:\n\n{{quote|May would hold court, discussing her days as a child actor in the Yiddish theater, as men hung on her every word. Every guy who knew her was in love with her. You'd have been stupid not to have been.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}} }}\n\nAs an integral member of their group, May was open to giving novices a chance, including the hiring of a black actor and generally making the group \"more democratic\". And by observing her high level of performance creativity, everyone's work was improved.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330}} \"She was the strongest woman I ever met,\" adds Compass actor Nancy Ponder.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330}}\n\nIn giving all her attention to acting, however, she neglected her home life. Fellow actress [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] recalled that May lived in a cellar with only one piece of furniture, a ping-pong table. \"She wore basic beatnik black and, like her film characters, was a brilliant disheveled klutz.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|330}}\n\nBecause she was physically attractive, some members of the group, including Nichols, became distracted during workshops. Group actor Omar Shapli was \"struck by her piercing, dark-eyed, sultry stare. It was really unnerving,\" he says.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}} Nichols remembers that \"everybody wanted Elaine, and the people who got her couldn't keep her.\" Theater critic [[John Lahr]] agrees, noting that \"her juicy good looks were a particularly disconcerting contrast to her sharp tongue.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}}\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=\"Elaine was too formidable, one of the most intelligent, beautiful, and witty women I had ever met. I hoped I would never see her again.\"|source=[[Richard Burton]]<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|331}}}}\n\nMay's sense of humor, including what she found funny about everyday life, was different from others' in the group. Novelist [[Herbert Gold]], who dated May, says that \"she treated everything funny that men take seriously... She was never serious. Her life was a narrative.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}} Another ex-boyfriend, James Sacks, says that \"Elaine had a genuine beautiful madness.\" Nevertheless, states Gold, \"she was very cute, a lot like [[Debra Winger]], just a pretty Jewish girl.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|329}}\n\nShe was considered highly intelligent. \"She's about fifty percent more brilliant than she needs to be,\" says actor Eugene Troobnick. Those outside their theater group sometimes noticed that same quality. British actor [[Richard Burton]], who was married to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] at the time, agreed with that impression after he first met May while he was starring in ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' on Broadway.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|331}}\n\n===Nichols and May comedy team===\n[[File:Elaine May and Mike Nichols 1960.JPG|thumb|Nichols and May, 1960]]\nNichols was personally asked to leave the Compass Players in 1957 because he and May became too good, which threw the company off balance, noted club manager Jay Landsman. Nichols was told he had too much talent.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|338}} Nichols then left the group in 1957, with May quitting with him. They next formed their own stand-up comedy team, [[Nichols and May]]. After contacting some agents in New York, they were asked to audition for [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who would later become [[Woody Allen]]'s manager and executive producer. Rollins said he was stunned by how good their act was:\n\n{{quote|Their work was so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were, actually as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy... They were totally adventurous and totally innocent, in a certain sense. That's why it was accepted. They would uncover little dark niches that you felt but had never expressed... I'd never seen this technique before. I thought, My God, these are two people writing hilarious comedy on their feet!<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|340}} }}\n\nBy 1960, they made their Broadway debut with ''An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May'', which later won a Grammy. After performing their act a number of years in New York's various clubs, and then on Broadway, with most of the shows sold out, Nichols could not believe their success:\n{{quote|We were winging it, making it up as we went along. It never even crossed our minds that it had any value beyond the moment. It was great to study and learn and work there. We were ''stunned'' when we got to New York... Never for a moment did we consider that we would do this for a living. It was just a handy way to make some money until we grew up.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|333}} }}\n\nHis feelings were shared by May, who was also taken aback by their success, especially having some real income after living in near-poverty. She told a ''Newsweek'' interviewer, \"When we came to New York, we were practically barefoot. And I still can't get used to walking in high heels.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|343}}\n\nThe uniqueness of their act made them an immediate success in New York. Their style became the \"next big thing\" in live comedy. [[Charles H. Joffe]], their producer, remembers that sometimes the line to their show went around the block. That partly explains why [[Milton Berle]], a major television comedy star, tried three times without success to see their act.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|341}} Critic Lawrence Christon recalls his first impression after seeing their act: \"You just knew it was a defining moment. They caught the urban tempo, like Woody Allen did.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|343}} They performed nightly at mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making TV program and commercial<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziahbVD5Y5o|title=Elaine May & Mike Nichols Commercial (stock footage / archival footage)|last=FilmArchivesNYC|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=29 July 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZc0jL6QMgU|title=Elaine May and Mike Nichols on Tax Day|last=Oscars|date=15 April 2016|accessdate=29 July 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> appearances and radio broadcasts.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|346}}\n\n===Technique===\n[[File:Nichols and May - 1961.jpg|thumb|Theater program from 1961]]\nAmong the qualities of their act, which according to one writer made them a rarity, was that they used both \"snob and mob appeal,\" which gave them a wide audience. Nachman explains that they presented a new kind of comedy team, unlike previous comedy duos which had an intelligent member alongside a much less intelligent one, as with [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Fibber McGee and Molly]], [[Burns and Allen]], [[Abbott and Costello]], and [[Martin and Lewis]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|322}}\n\nWhat differentiated their style was the fact that their stage performance created \"scenes,\" a method very unlike the styles of other acting teams. Nor did they rely on fixed gender or comic roles, but instead adapted their own character to fit a sketch idea they came up with. They chose real-life subjects, often from their own life, which were made into satirical and funny vignettes.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|322}}\n\nThis was accomplished by using subtle joke references which they correctly expected their audiences to recognize, whether through clich\u00e9s or character types. They thereby indirectly poked fun at the new intellectual culture which they saw growing around them. They felt that young Americans were taking themselves too seriously, which became the subject of much of their satire.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|321}}\n\nNichols structured the material for their skits, and May came up with most of their ideas.<ref name=Life/> Improvisation became a fairly simple art for them, as they portrayed the urban couple's \"Age of Anxiety\" in their sketches, and did so on their feet.<ref name=KashnerVanFair08>{{cite journal | author = Kashner, Sam | year = 2008 | title = The Movies: Here\u2019s to You, Mr. Nichols, The Making of The Graduate | journal = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | issue = February 29 | format = online, print | page = | url = https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/graduate200803 | access-date = 31 January 2016 | quote = }} Reprinted in Graydon Carter's ''Vanity Fair's Tales of Hollywood: Rebels, Reds, and Graduates,'', New York, NT, USA: Penguin, p. 169ff.</ref> According to May, it was simple: {{quote|It's nothing more than quickly creating a situation between two people and throwing up some kind of problem for one of them.<ref name=Life/>}}\n\nNichols notes that after coming up with a sketch idea, they would perform it soon after with little extra rehearsal or writing it down. One example he remembered was inspired simply from a phone call from his mother. I called Elaine and I said, \"I've got a really good piece for us tonight.\" They created a six-minute-long, mostly improvised, \"mother and son\" sketch, which they performed later that night.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|335}}<ref name=MotherSon1960>{{cite AV media | people = Nichols, Mike & May, Elaine, acting; Arthur Penn, producer | year = 1998 | orig-year = 1960 | chapter = Mother and Son [track 4] | title = An Evening With Mike Nichols And Elaine May ''(Original Cast Recording)'' |medium=  audio CD [vinyl] | asin = B000007Q8O | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKL1tNv__kU | access-date= 31 January 2016 | format = | time = | location= New York, NY, USA [Chicago, IL, USA] | publisher= PolyGram Records [Mercury Records] | id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nMay helped remove the stereotype of women's roles on stage. Producer [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]] notes that she accomplished that partly by not choosing traditional 1950s female roles for her characters, which were often housewives or women working at menial jobs. Instead, she often played the character of a sophisticated woman, such as a doctor, a psychiatrist, or an employer.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|337}} Shepherd notes that \"Elaine broke through the psychological restrictions of playing comedy as a woman.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|322}}\n\nNichols and May did have different attitudes toward their improvisations, however. Where Nichols always needed to know where a sketch was going and what its ultimate point would be, May preferred exploring ideas as the scene progressed. May says that even when they repeated their improvisations, it was not rote but came from re-creating her original impulse. Such improvisational techniques allowed her to make slight changes during a performance.<ref name=Life/> Although May had a wider improvisational range than Nichols, he was generally the one to shape the pieces and steer them to their end. For their recordings, he also made the decision of what to delete.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|323}}\n\n===Influence===\nNichols and May created a new \"Age of Irony\" for comedy, which showed actors arguing contemporary banalities as a key part of their routine. That style of comedy was picked up and further developed by later comics such as [[Steve Martin]], [[Bill Murray]], and [[David Letterman]].<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|323}} According to Martin, Nichols and May were among the first to satirize relationships. The word \"relationship,\" notes Martin, was first used in the early sixties: \"It was the first time I ever heard it satirized.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|323}} He recalls that soon after discovering their recorded acts, he went to sleep each night listening to them. \"They influenced us all and changed the face of comedy.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|324}}\n\nIn ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Woody Allen]] declared, \"\u201cIndividually, each one is a genius, and when they worked together, the sum was even greater than the combination of the parts\u2014the two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level\".<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/nichols-and-may-reunion-exclusive</ref>\n\n[[Lily Tomlin]] was also affected by their routines and considers May to be her inspiration as a comedian: \"There was nothing like Elaine May, with her voice, her timing, and her attitude,\" says Tomlin.<ref name=Lavin88>{{cite book | author = Lavin, Suzanne | year = 2004 | chapter = Overview (Chapter 1) | pages = 2, 9f, 43 | title = Women and Comedy in Solo Performance: Phyllis Diller, Lily Tomlin and Roseanne | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Routledge-Taylor & Francis | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0203643461 | isbn = 0203643461 | access-date = 31 January 2016 | quote = }}</ref>{{rp|43}} \"The nuances of the characterizations and the cultured types that they were doing completely appealed to me.

However, at the height of their fame, they decided to discontinue their act that year and took their careers in different directions: Nichols became a leading Broadway stage and film director; May became primarily a screenwriter and playwright, with some acting and directing. Among the reasons they decided to call it quits was that keeping their act fresh was becoming more difficult. Nichols explains:\n{{quote|Several things happened. One was that I, more than Elaine, became more and more afraid of our improvisational material. She was always brave. We never wrote a skit, we just sort of outlined it: I'll try to make you, or we'll fight\u2014whatever it was. We found ourselves doing the same material over and over, especially in our Broadway show. This took a great toll on Elaine.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|349}}}}\n\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=\"Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era. When Nichols and May split up, they left no imitators, no descendants, no blueprints or footprints to follow. No one could touch them.\"|source=Author [[Gerald Nachman]]<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|319}}}}\n\nNichols said that for him personally the breakup was \"cataclysmic\", and he went into a state of depression: \"I didn't know what I was or who I was.\" It was not until 1996, thirty-five years later, that they would work together again as a team, when she wrote the screenplay and he directed ''The Birdcage.'' It \"was like coming home, like getting a piece of yourself back that you thought you'd lost,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|353}} He adds that May had been very important to him from the moment he first saw her,<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|325}} adding that for her \"improv was innate,\" and few people have that gift.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|359}}\n\nDirector [[Arthur Penn]] said of their sudden breakup, \"They set the standard and then they had to move on.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|351}} To New York talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], \"They were one of the comic meteors in the sky.\"<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|348}}\n\nThey reunited for benefits for [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|George McGovern for President]] in 1972.\n\n=== Playwriting ===\nFollowing the break-up, May wrote several plays. Her greatest success was the one-act ''Adaptation''.

(Ritchie would later retitle the story ''A New Leaf''.) The unconventional 'romance' starred [[Walter Matthau]] as a Manhattan bachelor faced with bankruptcy and May herself as the wealthy but nerdy botanist he cynically romances and marries in order to salvage his extravagant lifestyle. Director May originally submitted a 180-minute work to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], but the studio cut it back by nearly 80 minutes for release.\n\nMay quickly followed up her debut film with 1972's ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''. She limited her role to directing, using a screenplay by [[Neil Simon]], based on a story by Bruce Jay Friedman. The film starred [[Charles Grodin]], [[Cybill Shepherd]], [[Eddie Albert]], and May's own daughter, [[Jeannie Berlin]]. It was a major critical success (holding a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes). It is listed at #91 in the AFI's 100 funniest movies of all time.\n\nMay's career then suffered a major setback. She followed up her two comedies by writing and directing a bleak crime drama entitled ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]'', starring [[Peter Falk]] and [[John Cassavetes]]. Budgeted at $1.8 million and scheduled for a summer 1975 release, the film ended up costing $4.3 million and not coming out until December 1976. She was eventually fired by [[Paramount Pictures]] (the studio which financed the film), but succeeded in getting herself rehired by hiding two reels of the negative until the studio gave in. The film's subsequent failure at the box office damaged her career in Hollywood and she did not direct again for a decade.\n\nIt was [[Warren Beatty]] who decided to give her one more chance. They collaborated on ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' (1987), starring Beatty and [[Dustin Hoffman]]. Largely shot on location in [[Morocco]], the production was beset by creative differences among the principals and had cost overruns. Long before the picture was ready for release, the troubled production had become the subject of numerous press stories, including a long cover article in New York Magazine. The advance publicity was largely negative<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ishtar/critic-reviews|title=Ishtar|publisher=Metacritic}}</ref> and, despite some positive reviews from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the film was a critical failure.\n\nMay did not direct another film for 29 years, when she directed the TV documentary ''[[Mike Nichols: American Masters]]'' in 2016.<ref>[http://thefilmstage.com/news/watch-elaine-mays-american-masters-documentary-on-mike-nichols/ \"Elaine May\u2019s \u2018American Masters\u2019 Documentary on Mike Nichols\"], ''The Film Stage'', Feb. 1, 2016</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn addition to writing three of the films she directed, Elaine May received an Oscar nomination for updating the 1941 film ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' as ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978). She contributed (uncredited) to the screenplay for the 1982 megahit ''[[Tootsie]]'', notably the scenes involving the character played by [[Bill Murray]]. She also contributed to the screenplay for ''[[Dangerous Minds]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unpacking the short but prickly filmography of Elaine May|url=https://film.avclub.com/unpacking-the-short-but-prickly-filmography-of-elaine-m-1798235875|work=AV Club|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay reunited with her former comic partner, [[Mike Nichols]], for an American adaptation of ''[[The Birdcage]]'' in 1996. The film relocated the classic French farce ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' from France to [[South Beach]], Miami. May received her second Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay when she again worked with Nichols on ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' in 1997.\n\nIn December 2013 Stanley Donen was in pre-production for a new film co-written with May, to be produced by Mike Nichols. A [[read-through|table reading]] of the script for potential investors included such actors as [[Christopher Walken]], [[Charles Grodin]], [[Ron Rifkin]], and Jeannie Berlin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2013/12/10/stanley-donen-gearing-up-to-direct-his-first-feature-in-30-years-1196501|title=Stanley Donen gearing up to direct his first feature in 30 years|accessdate=December 14, 2013|publisher=moviepilot.com|date=December 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017004556/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2013/12/10/stanley-donen-gearing-up-to-direct-his-first-feature-in-30-years-1196501|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Nichols died in 2014, however, and nothing further has been reported about this project.\n\n===Acting===\nMay has also acted in comedy films, including ''[[Enter Laughing (film)|Enter Laughing]]'' (1967), directed by [[Carl Reiner]], and ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), costarring [[Peter Falk]] and [[Jack Lemmon]]. The latter film was not well received by critics, although Lemmon said he enjoyed working alongside May: \"She's the finest actress I've ever worked with,\" he said. \"And I've never expressed an opinion about a leading lady before... I think Elaine is touched with genius. She approaches a scene like a director and a writer.\"<ref name=Life/>\n\nFilm scholar [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]] notes that May is drawn to material that borders on dry Yiddish humor. As such, it has not always been well received at the box office. Her style of humor, in writing or acting, often has more to do with traditional Yiddish theater than traditional Hollywood cinema.<ref name=foster>Foster, Gwendolyn Audrey. ''Women Film Directors: An International Bio-critical Dictionary'', Greenwood Publishing (1995) p. 246</ref>\n\nMay famously starred in [[A New Leaf (film)|''A New Leaf'']] (1971), which she also wrote and directed. The a dark comedy also co-starred [[Walter Matthau]]. [[Vincent Canby]] called it \"a beautifully and gently cockeyed movie that recalls at least two different traditions of American film comedy...

It is located on [[Interstate 40]] about eighty miles east of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and about thirty-five miles west of [[Petrified Forest National Park]].  In 2010, there were 1,386 inhabitants.<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census Bureau, Population Finder]</ref>\n\nIt is the site of the [[Jack Rabbit Trading Post]], a famous [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] landmark.\n\n==History==\nJoseph City was settled in 1876 by colonists from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].  This band of 73 pioneers was led by Captain William C. Allen.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 16.</ref>  They traveled to the Little Colorado River basin of Arizona.  Joseph City was one of four Little Colorado River colonies.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) xiii.</ref>  The other colonies were [[Brigham City, Arizona|Brigham City]], [[Sunset, Arizona|Sunset]], and [[Obed, Arizona|Obed]].  Joseph City is the only remaining colony.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 21, 32, 34.</ref>\n\nThe hardest trial for the new colonists was trying to get water for their crops. This meant that they had to try to tame the Little Colorado River. This was difficult due to the flooding season that would destroy dams along the river. The first dam was built in 1876, shortly after the colonists arrived in the area.  For the next 18 years the colonists built ten more dams. The eleventh dam was built in 1894.  This dam lasted for 29 years.  In 1923, the eleventh dam was destroyed and the colonists were forced to build a new dam. This dam still currently stands and directs water to the inhabitants still in the city.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 41-50.</ref>\n\nThe name of the colony changed twice since its colonization.  The area settled by Captain Allen's group was called Allen's Camp, in honor of their leader.  There was a name change in January 1878 to St. Joseph.  This change was brought about when the Little Colorado Stake was organized.  This name was suggested in order to honor [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  In 1923 there was a final name change to Joseph City.  Due to mail and freight shipment confusions, the [[Santa Fe Railway]], that also ran through [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]], asked that St. Joseph, Arizona change its name.  The residents of the town voted and the name became Joseph City.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 36.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nJoseph City is located at {{coord|34|57|21|N|110|20|02|W|type:city}} (34.955833, -110.333889).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.41|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|7.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|km2}} of it is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>{{cbignore}}\n}}\n\n==Climate==\n\nJoseph City has a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') with cold to cool winters and hot summers.

(elevation 5,000&nbsp;ft) is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] located in [[Navajo County, Arizona|Navajo County]], [[Arizona]], United States.  It is located on [[Interstate 40]] about eighty miles east of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and about thirty-five miles west of [[Petrified Forest National Park]].  In 2010, there were 1,386 inhabitants.<ref>[https://www.census.gov U.S. Census Bureau, Population Finder]</ref>\n\nIt is the site of the [[Jack Rabbit Trading Post]], a famous [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] landmark.\n\n==History==\nJoseph City was settled in 1876 by colonists from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].  This band of 73 pioneers was led by Captain William C. Allen.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 16.</ref>  They traveled to the Little Colorado River basin of Arizona.  Joseph City was one of four Little Colorado River colonies.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) xiii.</ref>  The other colonies were [[Brigham City, Arizona|Brigham City]], [[Sunset, Arizona|Sunset]], and [[Obed, Arizona|Obed]].  Joseph City is the only remaining colony.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 21, 32, 34.</ref>\n\nThe hardest trial for the new colonists was trying to get water for their crops. This meant that they had to try to tame the Little Colorado River. This was difficult due to the flooding season that would destroy dams along the river. The first dam was built in 1876, shortly after the colonists arrived in the area.  For the next 18 years the colonists built ten more dams. The eleventh dam was built in 1894.  This dam lasted for 29 years.  In 1923, the eleventh dam was destroyed and the colonists were forced to build a new dam. This dam still currently stands and directs water to the inhabitants still in the city.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 41-50.</ref>\n\nThe name of the colony changed twice since its colonization.  The area settled by Captain Allen's group was called Allen's Camp, in honor of their leader.  There was a name change in January 1878 to St. Joseph.  This change was brought about when the Little Colorado Stake was organized.  This name was suggested in order to honor [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  In 1923 there was a final name change to Joseph City.  Due to mail and freight shipment confusions, the [[Santa Fe Railway]], that also ran through [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]], asked that St. Joseph, Arizona change its name.  The residents of the town voted and the name became Joseph City.<ref>Tanner, George S and J Morris Richards, ''Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region'' (Flagstaff, Arizona: 1977) 36.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nJoseph City is located at {{coord|34|57|21|N|110|20|02|W|type:city}} (34.955833, -110.333889).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.41|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|7.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|km2}} of it is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>{{cbignore}}\n}}\n\n==Climate==\n\nJoseph City has a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') with cold to cool winters and hot summers.

{"title_page": "History of the Joseon dynasty", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThis article explains the '''history of the ''[[Joseon]]'' dynasty''', which ruled [[Korea]] from 1392 to 1897.\n\nThe history of [[Joseon]] is largely divided into two parts: the early period and the late period; some divide it into three parts, including a middle period. The standard for dividing the early period and the late period is the [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Imjinwaeran period (Japanese invasions of Korea)]] (1592 ~ 1598). The standard for dividing the early period and the middle period is the [[Jungjong coup]] (1505) and the standard for dividing the middle period and the late period is the [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Imjinwaeran period (Japanese invasions of Korea)]] or the [[Qing invasion of Joseon|Qing (Manchu) invasion of Joseon]] (1636~1637).\n\n==Rise to prominence==\nBy the late 14th century, the 400-year-old [[Goryeo]] dynasty established by [[Wang Geon]] in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and ''de facto'' occupation by the disintegrating [[Mongol Empire]]. The legitimacy of Goryeo itself was also becoming an increasingly disputed issue within the court, as the ruling house not only failed to govern the kingdom effectively, but was also supposedly tarnished by generations of forced intermarriage with the [[Yuan dynasty]] and rivalries among the various family branches. (Even [[U of Goryeo|King U]]'s mother was a known commoner, leading some to dispute his descent from [[Gongmin of Goryeo|King Gongmin]].) Within the kingdom, influential aristocrats, generals, and even prime ministers struggled for royal favor and domination of the court, resulting in deep division among various factions. With the ever-increasing number of raids conducted by [[Wokou]] and the invasions of the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turbans]], those who came to dominate the royal court were the reform-minded [[Sinjin aristocracy]] and the opposing [[Gwonmun aristocracy]], as well as generals who could fight off the foreign threats: namely Yi Seong-gye and a rival, [[Choe Yeong]].\n\nIn the wake of the [[Ming dynasty]] under the charismatic Zhu Yuanzhang (the [[Hongwu Emperor]]), the royal court in Goryeo split into two factions: the group led by General Yi (supporting the Ming Dynasty) and the camp led by General Choe (standing by the Yuan Dynasty). When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 (the 14th year of King U) to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo's northern territory, General Choe seized the chance and argued for the invasion of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. (Goryeo claimed to be the successor to the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo; as such, restoring [[Manchuria]] as part of Korean territory was part of its foreign policy throughout its history.) A staunchly opposed Yi was chosen to lead the invasion; however, at Wuihwa Island on the [[Yalu River]], he revolted and traveled back to Gaegyeong (modern-day [[Gaeseong]] and the capital of Goryeo). He proceeded to eliminate General Choe and his followers and began a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], overthrowing King U in favor of his son, [[Chang of Goryeo|King Chang]], in 1388. He later killed King U and his son after a failed restoration and forcibly placed a royal named Yo on the throne, who became [[Gongyang of Goryeo|King Gongyang]]. After indirectly enforcing his grasp on the royal court through the puppet king, Yi proceeded to ally himself with members of the Sinjin aristocracy, such as [[Jeong Dojeon]] and [[Jo Jun]]. One of his first acts as the ''de facto'' [[generalissimo]] of Goryeo was to pass the Gwajeon Law, which effectively confiscated land from the wealthy and generally conservative Gwonmun aristocrats and redistributed it among Yi's supporters in the Sinjin camp. In 1392 (the fourth year of King Gongyang), Yi's fifth son, [[Taejong of Joseon|Yi Bang-won]]\u2014after failing to persuade a noteworthy aristocrat named Jeong Mong-ju, a supporter of the old dynasty, to swear allegiance to the new reign\u2014had the noble killed by five assassins, including [[Jo Yeong-gyu]], at Seonjuk Bridge near Gaegyeong, eliminating a key figure in the opposition to Yi Seong-gye's rule. That same year, Yi dethroned King Gongyang, exiled him to [[Wonju]], and ascended to the throne. The Goryeo dynasty had come to an end after almost 500 years of rule.\n\n==Elimination of the vestiges of Goryeo==\n[[File:King Taejo Yi 02.jpg|thumb|left|King Taejo's portrait]]\nIn the beginning of his reign, Yi Seong-gye, now [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]], intended to continue using the name Goryeo for the country he ruled and simply change the royal line of descent to his own, thus maintaining the facade of continuing the 500-year-old Goryeo tradition. However, numerous threats of mutiny from the drastically weakened but still influential Gwonmun nobles\u2014who continued to swear allegiance to the remnants of the Goryeo Dynasty, now the demoted Wang clan\u2014and the overall belief in the reformed court that a new dynastic title was needed to signify the change led him to declare a new dynasty in 1393. He called it the Kingdom of Great Joseon in an effort to revive [[Gojoseon|an older dynasty]] by the same name. However, the new dynasty came to be referred to, even by historians today, simply by the name of its ruling house.\n\nWith the declaration of the new royal house, concerns were voiced on how to handle the remaining descendants of the deposed Wang family. King Taejo and his officials felt that if the legitimacy of their rule were ever questioned by the remaining members of the Goryeo Dynasty, they might have to suppress a mass rebellion or even risk losing the recently gained throne. In the end, Taejo had his prime minister, [[Jeong Dojeon]], summon the Wang family to the coast of the [[Yellow Sea]] and instruct them to board a ship bound for Ganghwa Island, where they were told they would live quietly out of the government's sight. However, the entire ploy was a trap. A crew member on board was instructed beforehand to smash a hole in the hull as soon as the ship had entered sufficiently deep waters. The ship sank, and the last members of the Goryeo Dynasty drowned. According to an urban legend, after the fate of the Wangs gullible enough to board the doomed ship reached their relatives on the mainland, most of them changed their surnames from Wang (\u738b) to Ok (\u7389) by adding an extra brush stroke, thus hiding their true descent.\n\nCalls for a new capital followed the demise of the last remnants of the Goryeo Dynasty. Although Gaegyeong had served well as the seat of government for over 400 years, it was a tradition for new dynasties in Korea to move their capitals, as this was considered fortuitous according to the Chinese [[feng shui]] philosophy of [[geomancy]]. Gaegyeong was also thought to have long since lost the energy required to maintain a permanent capital.\n\nThree sites were officially considered for the new capital: the foot of [[Gyeryongsan|Mount Gyeryong]] and the cities of Muak and Hanyang. The location near Mount Gyeryong was rejected because of its relatively rough terrain and lack of convenient communication. Muak was seriously considered before King Taejo decided that Hanyang was the most fitting candidate. Hanyang outranked its rivals in various respects. Not only was it easily accessible from sea and land, and geographically at the center of the [[Korean Peninsula]], but the fertile [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] valley on which the ancient city was situated had historically been the most contested region among the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. For centuries, Hanyang had also been said to be blessed, and Korean geomancers claimed that the city occupied a sacrosanct place flowing with geomantic energy. Furthermore, it had large mountains to the north and smaller mountains to the south for defense, with a large plain in between; thus, the city would fit the customary north\u2013south axis. In 1394, Hanyang was declared the new capital and formally renamed Hanseong. (It would eventually become the current capital of South Korea, [[Seoul]].) That year, the foot of Mount Bugak was chosen for the foundation of the main palace. Development and construction of the city and its complicated system of avenues, gates, walls, civilian residences, educational facilities, government buildings, and five main palace complexes began in 1394 as well. The official royal residence, [[Gyeongbok Palace]], was completed in 1395, while the less important Changdeok Palace was completed in 1405. Other royal palaces followed suit, and by the end of the first half of the 15th century, the capital had been completed.\n\n==Early strife==\n[[File:Gyeonghuigung.01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gyeongbokgung]] ]]\n\nKing Taejo had two wives, both of whom sired sons. His first wife, Queen Sineui, who died before the overthrow of Goryeo, gave birth to six sons. Taejo's wife upon his ascension to the throne, Queen Sindeok, had two sons. When the new dynasty was established, Taejo brought up the issue of which son would be his successor. Although Taejo's fifth son by Queen Sineui, [[Yi Bang-won]], had contributed most to his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred of two of his father's key allies in the court, Prime Minister Jeong Do-jeon and [[Nam Eun]]. Both sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt threatened. When it became clear that Yi Bang-won was the most worthy successor to the throne, Jeong used his influence on the king to convince him that the wisest choice would be the son whom Taejo loved most, not the son he felt was best for the kingdom. In 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo (the second son of Queen Sindeok)\u2014Grand Prince Uian (Yi Bang-seok)\u2014was appointed Prince Royal, or successor to the throne. After the sudden death of the queen, and while King Taejo was still in mourning, Jeong conspired to kill Yi Bang-won and his brothers to secure his position in the court. In 1398, upon hearing of this plan, Yi Bang-won immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Jeong, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This became known as the First Strife of Princes.\n\nAghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill one another for the crown, and psychologically exhausted from the death of his second wife, King Taejo immediately crowned his second son\u2014Yi Bang-gwa, later [[Jeongjong of Joseon|King Jeongjong]]\u2014as the new ruler. Soon after, he departed to the northern city of [[Hamhung]].\n\nOne of King Jeongjong's first acts as monarch was to revert the capital to [[Kaesong]], where he is believed to have been considerably more comfortable. Meanwhile, Yi Bang-won, not discouraged by the fact that his elder brother held the throne, began plotting to be established as Royal Prince Successor, the traditional title for brothers appointed as heir presumptives to the throne when the incumbent had no issue. However, Yi Bang-won's plans were opposed by Taejo's fourth son, Yi Bang-gan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, the tensions between Yi Bang-won's faction and Yi Bang-gan's camp escalated into an all-out conflict that came to be known as the Second Strife of Princes. In the aftermath of the struggle, the defeated Yi Bang-gan was exiled to [[Tosan County|Tosan]], while those who had urged him to battle Yi Bang-won were executed. Thoroughly intimidated, King Jeongjong immediately invested Yi Bang-won as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bang-won finally assumed the throne of Joseon, becoming [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]]. In 1401, the Joseon Dynasty was officially admitted into a [[tribute|tributary]] relationship with the [[Ming dynasty]] of China.\n\nIn the beginning of Taejong's reign, Taejo refused to relinquish the royal seal that signified the legitimacy of a king's rule. Uncomfortable at the fact that his father did not recognize him as a ''de jure'' ruler because of the family deaths he had caused, Taejong sent several messengers, among them his childhood friend Bak Sun, to recover the royal seal. However, Taejo assassinated every messenger that came into sight of his guards as a sign of his fury at Taejong, who remained unaware of their fates. This episode became known as the [[Case of the Hamhung Envoys]], and the term \"Hamhung envoy\" is still used in the [[Korean language]] to refer to a person who has gone on an assignment and has not been heard from.\n\n==Consolidation of power==\nWith his father unwilling to pass over the royal seal he needed for recognition, Taejong began to initiate policies he believed would prove his intelligence and right to rule. One of his first acts as king was to abolish the privilege enjoyed by the upper echelons of the government and aristocracy to maintain private armies. This effectively severed their ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of men employed in the national military.\n\nTaejong's next act as king was to revise the law concerning the taxation of land ownership and the documentation of state subjects. Although many aristocrats who benefited from King Taejo's property redistribution laws, from the Gwonmun aristocrats to the members of the Sinjin faction, had managed to avoid taxation by deliberately hiding land they acquired, King Taejong's re-investigation of land ownership in 1405 put an end to such practices. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national income increased twofold. In addition, King Taejong initiated the first population survey in 1413 and ordered the documentation of family names and clans, places of birth and death, and dates of birth and death for all Korean men. All males over the age of 16, whichever class in society they occupied, were also required by law to carry wooden tablets on which their name, birth date, and other information was engraved. Many historians regard this legislation as the predecessor of the Korean resident identification and social security system. It was also effective in preventing men from evading their mandatory military service.\n\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-KeunJeongJeon-02.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall)]]\n\nIn 1399 (the second year of King Jeongjong), Taejong had played an influential role in scrapping the [[Dopyeong Assembly]]\u2014a council of the old government that held a monopoly on court power during the waning years of the Goryeo Dynasty\u2014in favor of the [[State Council of Joseon]], a new branch of central administration that revolved around the king and his edicts. After passing the subject documentation and taxation laws, King Taejong issued a decree that decisions passed by the Euijeong Department could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom in which court ministers and advisers made decisions by debating and negotiating among themselves, with the king as an onlooker, and thus brought royal power to new heights. Shortly afterward, Taejong also created a branch of the government, known as the [[Sinmun Office]], to hear cases in which subjects felt they had been exploited or treated unfairly by government officials or aristocrats.\n\nIn 1418, Taejong abdicated. Two months later, in August, [[Sejong]] ascended to the throne. However, Taejong retained certain powers at court, particularly regarding military matters, until he died in 1422. King Sejong was an effective military planner. In May 1419, under the advice and guidance of his father, he embarked on the [[\u014cei Invasion|Gihae Eastern Expedition]] against Japanese pirates who had been operating out of [[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]]. (Before the Gihae expedition, Korea had cleared out pirates in 1389 and 1396.)\n\nIn September 1419, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of Tsushima, Sadamori, capitulated to the Joseon court. In 1443, The [[Treaty of Gyehae]] was signed, in which the Daimyo was granted the right to conduct trade with Korea on 50 ships per year, in exchange for sending tribute to Korea and helping stop any Japanese coastal pirate raid on Korean ports.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title= Korea\n |publisher= Routledge/Curzon\n |date=September 1999\n |isbn=978-0-7007-0464-4\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA255&dq=kyehae+treaty&q=kyehae%20treaty\n |pages= 594\n |last1=Pratt |first1=Keith L.\n |last2=Rutt  |first2=Richard\n |last3=Hoare |first3=James\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n |title= The Cambridge history of Japan\n |volume=3\n |publisher= Cambridge University Press\n |date= April 27, 1990\n |isbn=978-0-521-22354-6\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lCd4reJRaG8C&pg=PA442&dq=kyehae+treaty&q=kyehae%20treaty\n |pages= 748\n |last1=Yamamura |first1=K\u014dz\u014d\n |last2=Hall     |first2=John Whitney\n}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=112816&v=42 \uacc4\ud574\uc57d\uc870 \u7678\u4ea5\u7d04\u689d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610053214/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=112816&v=42 |date=2011-06-10 }}[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Britannica]]</ref><ref>{{in lang|ko}}[http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=236670&v=42 \uacc4\ud574\uc870\uc57d \u7678\u4ea5\u7d04\u689d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610053227/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=236670&v=42 |date=2011-06-10 }} [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]</ref>\n\nOn the northern border, Sejong established four forts and six posts ([[Hangul]]: \uc0ac\uad70\uc721\uc9c4; [[Hanja]]: \u56db\u90e1\u516d\u93ad) to safeguard his people from the hostile Chinese and [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] (who later became the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]) living in Manchuria. In 1433, he sent [[Kim Jong-seo (general)|Kim Jong-seo]] ({{lang-ko|\uae40\uc885\uc11c}}; [[Hanja]]: \u91d1\u5b97\u745e), a prominent general, north to destroy the Jurchens. Kim's military campaign captured several castles, pushed north, and restored Korean territory, roughly the present-day border between North Korea and China.<ref><<\ucc45\ud55c\uad8c\uc73c\ub85c \uc77d\ub294 \uc138\uc885\ub300\uc655\uc2e4\ub85d>>(Learning Sejong Silok in one book) {{ISBN|978-89-01-07754-3}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of Sejong, Korea saw technological advances in [[natural science]], [[agriculture]], [[literature]], and [[traditional medicine]]. Because of his success, Sejong received the title \"King Sejong the Great of Joseon\". His most remembered contribution is the creation of [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet, in 1443. Before that, Korean literati had used the [[Hanja]] writing system\u2014traditional Chinese characters with Korean pronunciation and meaning\u2014and a written language known as [[Hanmun]], which was basically [[Classical Chinese]], for official court documents. Everyday written use of Hanja and Hanmun ended gradually in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\n==Six martyred ministers==\nAfter King Sejong's death, his son [[Munjong of Joseon|Munjong]] continued his legacy but died of illness in 1452, two years after becoming king. Munjong's son [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]] then became king at the age of 12, but his uncle [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]] deposed him and took control of the government himself, becoming the seventh king of Joseon in 1455. After [[Six martyred ministers|six ministers loyal to Danjong]] tried to assassinate Sejo in order to return Danjong to the throne, Sejo executed the six ministers and also killed Danjong, who was in exile. Despite having snatched the throne from his young nephew, Sejo proved to be an able ruler. He strengthened the administrative system, enabling the government to determine exact population numbers and to mobilize troops effectively. He also revised land ordinances to improve the national economy and encouraged the publication of books. Most importantly, he compiled the Grand Code for State Administration, which became the cornerstone of dynastic administration and provided the first written form of constitutional law in Korea.\n\nSejo's son [[Yejong of Joseon|Yejong]] succeeded him to become the eighth king, but died two years later in 1469. Yejong's nephew [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] then ascended to the throne. His reign was marked by prosperity, economic growth, and the rise of [[neo-Confucian]] scholars called [[Sarim]], who were encouraged by Seongjong to enter court politics. Seongjong established Hongmungwan (\ud64d\ubb38\uad00, \u5f18\u6587\u9928), a royal library and advisory council composed of Confucian scholars, with whom he discussed philosophy and government policies. He ushered in a cultural golden age that rivaled King Sejong's reign, with the publication of numerous books on geography, ethics, and other topics. He also launched several military campaigns against the Jurchens to stabilize the northern border.\n\n==Literati purges==\n{{Main|Korean literati purges|Jungjong coup}}\n\nSeongjong's son [[Yeonsangun]], whose reign was marked by [[Korean Literati Purges|a series of bloody purges of neo-Confucian scholars]] between 1498 and 1506, is often considered{{Who|date=January 2016}} the worst tyrant in the Joseon Dynasty. His behavior became erratic after he learned that his biological mother was not Queen Jung-hyeon but deposed Consort Yoon, who had been forced to drink poison after poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines out of jealousy and leaving a scratch mark on Seongjong's face. When he was shown a piece of clothing allegedly stained with blood that his mother had vomited after drinking poison, he beat to death two of the concubines who had accused Consort Yoon and pushed Grand Queen Insu, who died afterward. He executed government officials who supported Consort Yoon's death, along with their families; he also executed Sarim scholars for writing texts critical of Sejo's usurpation of the throne. He seized a thousand women from the provinces to serve as palace entertainers and appropriated the [[Seonggyungwan]], the Royal University, as a personal pleasure ground. He abolished Hongmungwan and the Office of Censors, whose function was to criticize inappropriate actions and policies of the king. He banned the use of Hangul after commoners criticized him with posters written in that alphabet. After twelve years, he was deposed in a coup that placed his half-brother [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]] on the throne in 1506.\n\nJungjong was a fundamentally weak king because of the circumstances that placed him on the throne, but his reign also saw significant reforms led by his minister [[Jo Gwang-jo]], the charismatic leader of Sarim scholars. He established a local self-government system called [[Hyang'yak]] to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit; sought to reduce the gap between rich and poor by distributing land to farmers more equally and by limiting the amount of land and the number of slaves that one could own; promulgated Confucian writings widely with vernacular translations; and reduced the number of bureaucrats. According to [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], no official dared to take a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because Jo applied the law so strictly. These radical reforms were very popular with commoners but were fiercely opposed by the conservative officials who had helped to put Jungjong on the throne. They plotted to make Jungjong doubt Jo's loyalty by writing \"Jo will become the king\" (\uc8fc\ucd08\uc704\uc655, \u8d70\u8096\u7232\u738b) with honey on leaves, so that caterpillars left behind the phrase like a supernatural manifestation. Jo was executed, and most of his reform measures died with him in the [[Korean Literati Purges#Third Literati Purge of 1519|Third Literati Purge of 1519]]. For nearly 50 years afterward, court politics were marred by bloody and chaotic struggles between factions backing rival consorts and princes. In-laws of the royal family wielded great power and contributed to much of the corruption.\n\n==Factional struggle==\n{{Main|Sarim}}\n\nThe [[Sarim]] faction, which suffered a series of political defeats during the reign of [[Yeonsangun]], [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]], gained control of the government under [[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]], but was soon split into a [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Western faction]] and an [[Easterners|Eastern faction]], which in turn split into [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northern]] and [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southern]] factions. The Western faction also eventually split into the Old Learning and New Learning factions. Changes in power between these factions were often accomplished with charges of treason and accompanied by bloody purges, initiating a cycle of revenge.\n\nOne example is the Gichuk [[Treason Case of 1589]] (\uae30\ucd95\uc625\uc0ac), in which an Easterner, Jeong Yeo-rip, was accused of conspiracy to start a rebellion. Jeong had formed a society with a group of supporters who had received military training to fight against Japanese marauders. There is still dispute about the nature and purpose of Jeong's group, which reflected a desire for a classless society and spread throughout the Honam region. Jeong Cheol, the head of the Western faction, was in charge of investigating the case and used it to carry out a widespread purge of Easterners who had the slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip. A thousand Easterners were killed or exiled.\n\n==Japanese invasions==\n{{main|Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)}}\n\n[[File:Turtle boat.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Turtle ship]].

The only job of the Korean navy was to secure the maritime trade against the pirates. The navy maintained superiority over the pirates by using advanced gunpowder technologies, such as cannons and [[fire arrows]] (e.g., [[singijeon]] deployed by [[hwacha]]).\n\nDuring [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592 to 1598]], Japanese warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], hoping to conquer [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] China with Portuguese guns, invaded Korea with his [[daimy\u014d]] and their troops in 1592 and 1597. Factional divisions in the Joseon court, inability to assess Japanese military capability, and failed attempts at diplomacy led to poor preparation on Joseon's part. Using European firearms, the Japanese were able to occupy most of the southern peninsula within months, with both [[Pyongyang]] and Hanseong (present-day Seoul) captured. According to the [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], the Japanese were joined by rebelling Korean [[slavery|slaves]], who burned down the palace of [[Gyeongbokgung]] and its storehouse of slave records.<ref>[http://sillok.history.go.kr/inspection/insp_king.jsp?id=wna_12505003_006 \u5ba3\u7956\u5be6\u9304\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u5e74 (1592) \u4e94\u6708\u58ec\u620c (May 3)] \"\u5371\u4ea1\u8feb\u81f3, \u541b\u81e3\u4e4b\u9593, \u4f55\u53ef\u6709\u96b1? \u5927\u62b5\u6536\u62fe\u4eba\u5fc3\u7232\u4e0a\u3002 \u8fd1\u4f86\u5bae\u4eba\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002 \u5167\u9700\u53f8\u4eba, \u5047\u7a31\u5bae\u7269, \u800c\u7a4d\u6028\u65bc\u6c11\u3002 \u4eca\u65e5\u751f\u8b8a\u4e4b\u7531, \u7686\u7de3\u738b\u5b50\u5bae\u4eba\u4f5c\u5f0a, \u6545\u4eba\u5fc3\u6028\u53db, \u8207\u502d\u540c\u5fc3\u77e3\u3002 \u805e\u8cca\u4e4b\u4f86\u4e5f, \u8a00: \u2018\u6211\u4e0d\u6bba\u6c5d\u8f29, \u6c5d\u541b\u8650\u6c11, \u6545\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u2019 \u4e91\u6211\u6c11\u4ea6\u66f0: \u2018\u502d\u4ea6\u4eba\u4e5f, \u543e\u7b49\u4f55\u5fc5\u68c4\u5bb6\u800c\u907f\u4e5f?\u2019 \u8acb\u8a85\u5167\u9700\u53f8\u4f5c\u5f0a\u4eba, \u4e14\u514d\u5e73\u5b89\u9053\u7a4d\u5e74\u900b\u6b20\u3002\" \"\u6176\u5c19\u9053\u4eba\u7686\u53db\u4e91, \u7136\u8036?\"-[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty|The annals of the Choson Dynasty]]-[[National Institute of Korean History]]</ref>\n\n[[Righteous Army|Local resistance]], however, slowed down the Japanese advance, and decisive naval victories by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] left control of sea routes in Korean hands, severely hampering Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] China intervened on the side of the Koreans, sending a large force in 1593 that helped push back the Japanese. During the war, the Koreans developed powerful firearms, high-quality gunpowder, and [[Turtle ship]]s.\n\nThe Joseon and Ming forces defeated the Japanese, who retreated back to their homeland, but victory came at a deep price. Farmlands were devastated, irrigation dikes were destroyed, and villages and towns were burned down. The population was first plundered and then dispersed, and tens of thousands of skilled workers ([[celadon]] ware makers, craftsmen, artisans, etc.) were either killed or kidnapped and taken to Japan as captives to help the Japanese develop their crafts. The Japanese also pilfered many thousands of Joseon historical and royal boiis, many of which are preserved in Japanese museums.\n\nIn 1598, the Japanese withdrew their troops from Korea after Hideyoshi died. As the Japanese retreated, Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered a vigorous pursuit by the Koreans. However, Yi was killed by a single bullet in the [[Battle of Noryang]] on December 16, 1598.\n\nAs a result of the wars, the Japanese took the ears and noses of some 38,000 Koreans as trophies (a common [[samurai]] practice) and built the [[Mimizuka]] monument in [[Ky\u014dto]]. The long war reduced the productive capacity of farmlands from 1,708,000 kyol (a land unit) to 541,000 kyol. Following the war, relations between Korea and Japan were completely suspended, and Japan was cut off from the technology of continental Asia. After the death of Hideyoshi, however, negotiations between the Korean court and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] were carried out via the Japanese lord on Tsushima.\n\nIn 1604, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], needing to restore commercial relations with Korea in order to regain access to the technology of the mainland, met Korea's demands and released some 3,000 captive Koreans. As a result, in 1607, a Korean mission visited [[Edo]], and diplomatic and trade relations were restored on a limited basis.\n\n==Manchu invasions==\nFollowing these events, the Korean kingdom became increasingly [[isolationist]]. In addition, the Ming dynasty was weakened, partly because of the war between Korea and Japan, and the new [[Qing dynasty]] was established. The Koreans decided to build tighter borders, exert more control over inter-border traffic, and wait out the initial turbulence of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] overthrow of the Ming.\n\nDespite these limits, Korea had extensive trade with [[Mongolia]], [[North Asia|Northern Asia]], China, and Japan. However, at times, trade with Japan was limited to missions appointed by the king in order to prevent piracy and maintain orderly trade, which had been a problem even in the Goryeo period.\n\nKorea was twice invaded by the Manchus, in 1627 (the [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|First Manchu Invasion of Korea]]) and 1637 (the [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|Second Manchu Invasion of Korea]]). Korea surrendered to the Manchus and became a tributary state of the Qing dynasty, which at that time involved two-way trade missions with China.\n\n==Political factions==\n{{main|Political factions in Joseon Dynasty}}\n\nThroughout the Joseon era, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance of the political system. In the earliest years of Joseon, tension between the capital faction and the [[Yeongnam]]-based [[Sarim]] faction predominated. Village [[Seowon]], which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elites. In areas where the Western faction dominated, key figures of Western thought were enshrined. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the [[Easterners (Korean political faction)|Eastern faction]] (''Dong-in'') and [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Western faction]] (''Seo-in''). The Eastern faction in turn split under the reign of [[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]] between the hard-line [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northern faction]] (''Buk-in'') and the moderate [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southern faction]] (''Nam-in'').<ref>Lee (1984), p. 221.</ref> The Western faction later split between the [[Old Learning]] (''Noron'') and the [[Young Learning]] (''Soron'') factions.\n\nThese splits were often driven by questions of royal succession or appropriate royal conduct. For example, the split between the Northerners and Southerners was driven by questions involving the proper successor to Seonjo, who had no legitimate son. The Northerners came to support the [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghaegun]]; accordingly, they flourished under his reign (1608\u20131623) but were swept from power by the Westerners after the succession of [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]].\n\nUnder the reigns of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] in the 18th century, the kings pursued a strict policy of equality, favoring no faction over another.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 223.</ref> However, during Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged between the [[Byeokpa]] and [[Sipa (Korean Faction)|Sipa]], two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes toward Yeongjo's murder of his son, who was also Jeongjo's father. In the 19th century, the playing field shifted once more, and in-law families rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the [[Andong Kim clan]] was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang Jo clan.\n\nWhen [[Heungseon Daewongun]] took power, factional politics started to decline, and disappeared by the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Late Joseon period==\n[[File:Bifyu 8.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Hwaseong Fortress]] in [[Suwon]].]]\nAfter the Manchu invasions, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]] led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty. [[Sukjong of Joseon|King Sukjong]] and his son [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] tried to solve the problems resulting from factional politics.\n\nYeongjo's grandson, [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]], made various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing [[Kyujanggak]], an imperial library. Its purpose was to improve the cultural and political position of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to run the nation. King Jeongjo also spearheaded bold new social initiatives, opening government positions to those who would have previously been barred because of their social status. He had the support of many [[Silhak]] scholars, and in addition, the Silhak scholars supported Jeongjo's regal power. King Jeongjo's reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture.\n\nDuring the 19th century, drought and floods alternately struck rice fields and farms in Korea and caused great famines. Making matters worse, rulers increased taxes on crops and required more free labor from the starving peasants. Anti-government and anti-landlord sentiment boiled over into violent uprisings.\n\nIn 1812, [[Hong Gyeong-nae]] led the peasants of Gasan in the northern part of Korea in an armed rebellion and occupied the region for several months. An army was sent to quell the rebellion but only succeeded after a savage scorched-earth campaign. Throughout Korea, all the way to [[Jeju Island]], peasants continued to defy the king and ministers in [[Seoul]], as well as the local nobility and wealthy landlords. In 1862, a group of farmers in [[Jinju]], in [[Gyeongsang Province]], rose up against their provincial officials and the wealthy landowners in response to exploitation of destitute farmers. The whole of Joseon was plunged in confusion. [[Choe Je-u]] (\ucd5c\uc81c\uc6b0, \u5d14\u6fdf\u611a, 1824\u20131894) established the ideology of [[Donghak]] (Eastern learning) in the 1860s. [[Roman Catholic]]ism was also introduced in this period, but [[Christianity]] in all its forms was brutally oppressed by the Korean government until the late 1880s.\n\nIn 1863, [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] took the throne. His father, Regent [[Heungseon Daewongun]], ruled for him until Gojong reached adulthood. Daewongun is largely said to have been responsible for the brutal suppression of Christianity in Korea during his regency. In the mid-1860s, he was the main proponent of isolationism and the instrument of the persecution of native and foreign Catholics, a policy that led directly to the [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|French campaign against Korea in 1866]]. The early years of his rule also witnessed an effort to restore the dilapidated [[Gyeongbok Palace]], the seat of royal authority. During Daewongun's reign, factional politics and power wielded by the Andong Kim clan disappeared.\n\nIn 1873, King Gojong announced his direct royal rule. With the subsequent retirement of Daewongun, Queen Min (later called [[Empress Myeongseong]]) gained complete control over her court and placed her family in high positions.\n\n===Western intervention===\n{{See also|French Campaign against Korea, 1866|United States expedition to Korea (1871)|Treaty of Ganghwa}}\n\nThe French campaign against Korea in 1866 is also known as Byeonginyangyo (Korean: \ubcd1\uc778\uc591\uc694, Western Disturbance of the Byeong-in Year). It refers to the French occupation of [[Ganghwa Island]] in retaliation for the execution of French [[Jesuit]] priests proselytizing illicitly in Korea. The campaign, which lasted nearly six weeks, was the first armed encounter between Korea and a Western power. The overall result was a French retreat and a check on France's influence in the region. The violent encounter also confirmed Korea in its isolationism for another decade.\n\nThe [[United States expedition to Korea (1871)|United States expedition to Korea in 1871]], also known as Sinmiyangyo (Korean: \uc2e0\ubbf8\uc591\uc694, Western Disturbance of the Sinmi Year), was the first American military action in Korea. It, too, took place predominantly on and around Ganghwa Island. The American military expeditionary force arrived to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea, to ascertain the fate of the [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'']] merchant ship, and to establish a treaty assuring aid for shipwrecked sailors. The conservative nature of the Joseon government and the assertiveness of the Americans led to a misunderstanding between the two parties that changed a diplomatic expedition into an armed conflict. The United States won a minor military victory, but because the Koreans refused to open the country to the Americans (and the U.S. forces in Korea did not have the authority or strength to press the issue), the United States failed to secure its diplomatic objectives.\n\nIn 1875, the [[Japanese gunboat Un'y\u014d|''Un'y\u014d'']], a small Japanese warship, was dispatched to survey coastal waters without Korean permission. It attacked a Korean port and withdrew back to Japan. The Japanese took the opportunity to demand a treaty. The [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] became the first [[unequal treaty]] signed by Korea; it gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea, forced the Korean government to open three ports\u2014[[Busan]], [[Incheon]], and [[Wonsan]]\u2014to Japanese and foreign trade, and made Korea establish its independence from China in foreign relations.\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Taegukgi.jpg|thumb|An early version of the [[Korean flag]].]]\n\nIn the 19th century, tensions mounted between [[Qing China]] and [[Japan]], culminating in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895). Much of this war was fought on the Korean Peninsula. Japan, having acquired Western military technology after the [[Meiji Restoration]], had forced Joseon to sign the Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876. Japan encroached on Korean territory in search of fish, iron ore, and natural resources. It also established a strong economic presence, heralding the beginning of Japanese imperial expansion in East Asia.\n\n===Imo Rebellion and Gapsin Coup===\n{{main|Imo Incident|Gapsin Coup}}\nAs the dynasty declined, the king began to rely on newer, rifle-using armies. They were paid well, and members of the old army, who used spears and old [[matchlock]]s, lost much of their pay. The old army revolted in response. Heungseon Daewongun was restored to power, but the Qing general [[Yuan Shikai]] soon had him abducted by Chinese troops and taken to China, thus foiling his return. Four years later, Daewongun returned to Korea.\n\nOn December 4, 1884, five revolutionaries led a small army to [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]]'s brother's house and initiated a [[coup d'\u00e9t\u00e2t]]. It failed in three days. Some coup leaders, including [[Kim Ok-gyun]], fled to Japan, and others were executed.\n\n===Donghak Peasant Revolution===\n{{Main|Donghak Peasant Revolution}}\n\nThe [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] was an anti-government, anti-[[yangban]], and anti-foreign campaign.\n\nThe peasants demanded land redistribution, lower taxes, democracy, and human rights. Taxes were so high that most farmers had been forced to sell their ancestral homesteads to rich landowners at bargain prices. As a result, the peasant class developed intense anti-Japanese and anti-yangban sentiments. The immediate causes of the rebellion were the actions of [[Jo Byong-gap]], a government official whose rule was viewed by some as tyrannical and corrupt. On January 11, 1894, peasant leader [[Jeon Bong-jun]] defeated the government forces at the battle of [[Jeongeup|Go-bu]], and Jo's properties were handed out to the peasants. In the meantime, the Joseon government army attacked Jeonju, and the government and the peasant army concluded an agreement. However, the Joseon government then asked the Chinese government for urgent assistance in ending the revolt. After notifying the Japanese in accordance with the [[Convention of Tientsin]], China sent troops into Korea. It was the catalyst for the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nIn late June 1894, pro-Japanese forces hatched a plan to wipe out the peasant army in cooperation with the Japanese troops stationed in [[Incheon]] and [[Seoul]]. On October 16, the peasant army moved toward [[Gongju]] for the final battle, which was a trap: The Japanese and the pro-Japanese government troops were waiting for them. The peasant army was defeated in the [[Battle of Ugeumchi]]. The Japanese had cannons and other modern weapons, whereas the Korean peasants were armed only with bows and arrows, spears, swords, and some [[flintlock]] muskets. A few months later, Jeon was captured and executed.\n\nThe revolution failed, but many of the peasants' grievances would later be addressed through the [[Gabo Reform]].\n\n===Eulmi Incident===\n{{main|Eulmi Incident}}\n\nIn 1895, Empress Myeongseong (referred to as \"Queen Min\" by the United States<ref name=\"queen min\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/11/10/106073098.pdf Characteristics of Queen of Corea] ''[[The New York Times]]'' Nov 10, 1895</ref> and Japan) was assassinated by Japanese agents;<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2004/11/09/200411090500053/200411090500053_1.html\n |script-title=ko:\uc77c\ubcf8\uc778 \ud3ed\ub3c4\uac00 \uac00\uc2b4\uc744 \uc138 \ubc88 \uc9d3\ubc1f\uace0 \uc77c\ubcf8\ub3c4\ub85c \ub09c\uc790\ud588\ub2e4\n |newspaper=[[Dong-a Ilbo]]\n |author=Park Jong-hyo (\ubc15\uc885\ud6a8)\n |date= 2002-01-01\n |issue= 508\n |pages=472\u2013485\n |language=Korean\n}}</ref> she had tried to counter Japanese interference in Korea and was considering turning to Russia or China for support. The Japanese minister to Korea, [[Miura Gor\u014d]], orchestrated the plot against her. A group of Japanese agents, along with the [[Hullyeondae]] Army,<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\"/> entered the royal palace in Seoul, and an agent killed the empress and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.\n\n===Establishment of the Korean Empire===\n{{Main|Korean Empire}}\n[[File:Dokripmun.jpg|thumb|[[Independence Gate]], built in 1896]]\n\nThe Chinese defeat in the 1894 war led to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] between [[China]] and [[Japan]], which officially guaranteed Korea's independence from its tributary status with China. For Japan, it was a step toward regional [[hegemony]] in Korea. After that, Korea built the [[Independence Gate]] and stopped paying tributes to the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Joseon court, pressured by encroachment from larger powers, felt the need to reinforce national integrity and declared the [[Korean Empire]] in 1897. [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] assumed the title of emperor in order to assert Korea's independence. He tried to promote the [[Gwangmu Reform]], but failed because of opposition from the general populace and the Japanese.\n\nTechnically, 1897 marks the end of the Joseon period, as the official name of the empire was changed. However, the dynasty continued to reign, albeit perturbed by Japanese interventions.\n\n===Japanese occupation===\nIn a complicated series of maneuvers and counter-maneuvers, Japan pushed back a Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in 1905. After the conclusion of the 1904\u20131905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], the way was open for Japan to take control of Korea.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Eulsa Treaty|Protectorate Treaty]] in 1905, Korea became a [[protectorate]] of Japan. [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] became the first resident general of Korea. He was assassinated by a [[Korean independence activist]], [[An Jung-geun]], in 1909 at the train station at [[Harbin]].\n\nFollowing the Protectorate Treaty, Gojong sent representatives to the [[Hague Peace Conference#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Peace Convention]] of 1907 to try to re-assert his sovereignty over Korea. Although the Korean representatives were blocked by the Japanese delegates, they did not give up, and later held interviews with newspapers. The Japanese forced Gojong to abdicate, and his son [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]] succeeded to the throne.\n\nIn 1910, in the face of opposition from many Koreans, the [[Japanese Empire]] [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] Korea by force.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Korea]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Joseon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Joseon Dynasty}}\n[[Category:Joseon dynasty|.]]\n[[Category:History of Korea]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThis article explains the '''history of the ''[[Joseon]]'' dynasty''', which ruled [[Korea]] from 1392 to 1897.\n\nThe history of [[Joseon]] is largely divided into two parts: the early period and the late period; some divide it into three parts, including a middle period. The standard for dividing the early period and the late period is the [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Imjinwaeran period (Japanese invasions of Korea)]] (1592 ~ 1598). The standard for dividing the early period and the middle period is the [[Jungjong coup]] (1505) and the standard for dividing the middle period and the late period is the [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Imjinwaeran period (Japanese invasions of Korea)]] or the [[Qing invasion of Joseon|Qing (Manchu) invasion of Joseon]] (1636~1637).\n\n==Rise to prominence==\nBy the late 14th century, the 400-year-old [[Goryeo]] dynasty established by [[Wang Geon]] in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and ''de facto'' occupation by the disintegrating [[Mongol Empire]]. The legitimacy of Goryeo itself was also becoming an increasingly disputed issue within the court, as the ruling house not only failed to govern the kingdom effectively, but was also supposedly tarnished by generations of forced intermarriage with the [[Yuan dynasty]] and rivalries among the various family branches. (Even [[U of Goryeo|King U]]'s mother was a known commoner, leading some to dispute his descent from [[Gongmin of Goryeo|King Gongmin]].) Within the kingdom, influential aristocrats, generals, and even prime ministers struggled for royal favor and domination of the court, resulting in deep division among various factions. With the ever-increasing number of raids conducted by [[Wokou]] and the invasions of the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turbans]], those who came to dominate the royal court were the reform-minded [[Sinjin aristocracy]] and the opposing [[Gwonmun aristocracy]], as well as generals who could fight off the foreign threats: namely Yi Seong-gye and a rival, [[Choe Yeong]].\n\nIn the wake of the [[Ming dynasty]] under the charismatic Zhu Yuanzhang (the [[Hongwu Emperor]]), the royal court in Goryeo split into two factions: the group led by General Yi (supporting the Ming Dynasty) and the camp led by General Choe (standing by the Yuan Dynasty). When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 (the 14th year of King U) to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo\u2019s northern territory, General Choe seized the chance and argued for the invasion of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. (Goryeo claimed to be the successor to the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo; as such, restoring [[Manchuria]] as part of Korean territory was part of its foreign policy throughout its history.) A staunchly opposed Yi was chosen to lead the invasion; however, at Wuihwa Island on the [[Yalu River]], he revolted and traveled back to Gaegyeong (modern-day [[Gaeseong]] and the capital of Goryeo). He proceeded to eliminate General Choe and his followers and began a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], overthrowing King U in favor of his son, [[Chang of Goryeo|King Chang]], in 1388. He later killed King U and his son after a failed restoration and forcibly placed a royal named Yo on the throne, who became [[Gongyang of Goryeo|King Gongyang]]. After indirectly enforcing his grasp on the royal court through the puppet king, Yi proceeded to ally himself with members of the Sinjin aristocracy, such as [[Jeong Dojeon]] and [[Jo Jun]]. One of his first acts as the ''de facto'' [[generalissimo]] of Goryeo was to pass the Gwajeon Law, which effectively confiscated land from the wealthy and generally conservative Gwonmun aristocrats and redistributed it among Yi's supporters in the Sinjin camp. In 1392 (the fourth year of King Gongyang), Yi's fifth son, [[Taejong of Joseon|Yi Bang-won]]\u2014after failing to persuade a noteworthy aristocrat named Jeong Mong-ju, a supporter of the old dynasty, to swear allegiance to the new reign\u2014had the noble killed by five assassins, including [[Jo Yeong-gyu]], at Seonjuk Bridge near Gaegyeong, eliminating a key figure in the opposition to Yi Seong-gye's rule. That same year, Yi dethroned King Gongyang, exiled him to [[Wonju]], and ascended to the throne. The Goryeo dynasty had come to an end after almost 500 years of rule.\n\n==Elimination of the vestiges of Goryeo==\n[[File:King Taejo Yi 02.jpg|thumb|left|King Taejo's portrait]]\nIn the beginning of his reign, Yi Seong-gye, now [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]], intended to continue using the name Goryeo for the country he ruled and simply change the royal line of descent to his own, thus maintaining the facade of continuing the 500-year-old Goryeo tradition. However, numerous threats of mutiny from the drastically weakened but still influential Gwonmun nobles\u2014who continued to swear allegiance to the remnants of the Goryeo Dynasty, now the demoted Wang clan\u2014and the overall belief in the reformed court that a new dynastic title was needed to signify the change led him to declare a new dynasty in 1393. He called it the Kingdom of Great Joseon in an effort to revive [[Gojoseon|an older dynasty]] by the same name. However, the new dynasty came to be referred to, even by historians today, simply by the name of its ruling house.\n\nWith the declaration of the new royal house, concerns were voiced on how to handle the remaining descendants of the deposed Wang family. King Taejo and his officials felt that if the legitimacy of their rule were ever questioned by the remaining members of the Goryeo Dynasty, they might have to suppress a mass rebellion or even risk losing the recently gained throne. In the end, Taejo had his prime minister, [[Jeong Dojeon]], summon the Wang family to the coast of the [[Yellow Sea]] and instruct them to board a ship bound for Ganghwa Island, where they were told they would live quietly out of the government's sight. However, the entire ploy was a trap. A crew member on board was instructed beforehand to smash a hole in the hull as soon as the ship had entered sufficiently deep waters. The ship sank, and the last members of the Goryeo Dynasty drowned. According to an urban legend, after the fate of the Wangs gullible enough to board the doomed ship reached their relatives on the mainland, most of them changed their surnames from Wang (\u738b) to Ok (\u7389) by adding an extra brush stroke, thus hiding their true descent.\n\nCalls for a new capital followed the demise of the last remnants of the Goryeo Dynasty. Although Gaegyeong had served well as the seat of government for over 400 years, it was a tradition for new dynasties in Korea to move their capitals, as this was considered fortuitous according to the Chinese [[feng shui]] philosophy of [[geomancy]]. Gaegyeong was also thought to have long since lost the energy required to maintain a permanent capital.\n\nThree sites were officially considered for the new capital: the foot of [[Gyeryongsan|Mount Gyeryong]] and the cities of Muak and Hanyang. The location near Mount Gyeryong was rejected because of its relatively rough terrain and lack of convenient communication. Muak was seriously considered before King Taejo decided that Hanyang was the most fitting candidate. Hanyang outranked its rivals in various respects. Not only was it easily accessible from sea and land, and geographically at the center of the [[Korean Peninsula]], but the fertile [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] valley on which the ancient city was situated had historically been the most contested region among the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. For centuries, Hanyang had also been said to be blessed, and Korean geomancers claimed that the city occupied a sacrosanct place flowing with geomantic energy. Furthermore, it had large mountains to the north and smaller mountains to the south for defense, with a large plain in between; thus, the city would fit the customary north-south axis. In 1394, Hanyang was declared the new capital and formally renamed Hanseong. (It would eventually become the current capital of South Korea, [[Seoul]].) That year, the foot of Mount Bugak was chosen for the foundation of the main palace. Development and construction of the city and its complicated system of avenues, gates, walls, civilian residences, educational facilities, government buildings, and five main palace complexes began in 1394 as well. The official royal residence, [[Gyeongbok Palace]], was completed in 1395, while the less important Changdeok Palace was completed in 1405. Other royal palaces followed suit, and by the end of the first half of the 15th century, the capital had been completed.\n\n==Early strife==\n[[File:Gyeonghuigung.01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gyeongbokgung]] ]]\n\nKing Taejo had two wives, both of whom sired sons. His first wife, Queen Sineui, who died before the overthrow of Goryeo, gave birth to six sons. Taejo's wife upon his ascension to the throne, Queen Sindeok, had two sons. When the new dynasty was established, Taejo brought up the issue of which son would be his successor. Although Taejo's fifth son by Queen Sineui, [[Yi Bang-won]], had contributed most to his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred of two of his father's key allies in the court, Prime Minister Jeong Do-jeon and [[Nam Eun]]. Both sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt threatened. When it became clear that Yi Bang-won was the most worthy successor to the throne, Jeong used his influence on the king to convince him that the wisest choice would be the son whom Taejo loved most, not the son he felt was best for the kingdom. In 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo (the second son of Queen Sindeok)\u2014Grand Prince Uian (Yi Bang-seok)\u2014was appointed Prince Royal, or successor to the throne. After the sudden death of the queen, and while King Taejo was still in mourning, Jeong conspired to kill Yi Bang-won and his brothers to secure his position in the court. In 1398, upon hearing of this plan, Yi Bang-won immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Jeong, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This became known as the First Strife of Princes.\n\nAghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill one another for the crown, and psychologically exhausted from the death of his second wife, King Taejo immediately crowned his second son\u2014Yi Bang-gwa, later [[Jeongjong of Joseon|King Jeongjong]]\u2014as the new ruler. Soon after, he departed to the northern city of [[Hamhung]].\n\nOne of King Jeongjong's first acts as monarch was to revert the capital to [[Kaesong]], where he is believed to have been considerably more comfortable. Meanwhile, Yi Bang-won, not discouraged by the fact that his elder brother held the throne, began plotting to be established as Royal Prince Successor, the traditional title for brothers appointed as heir presumptives to the throne when the incumbent had no issue. However, Yi Bang-won's plans were opposed by Taejo's fourth son, Yi Bang-gan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, the tensions between Yi Bang-won's faction and Yi Bang-gan's camp escalated into an all-out conflict that came to be known as the Second Strife of Princes. In the aftermath of the struggle, the defeated Yi Bang-gan was exiled to [[Tosan County|Tosan]], while those who had urged him to battle Yi Bang-won were executed. Thoroughly intimidated, King Jeongjong immediately invested Yi Bang-won as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bang-won finally assumed the throne of Joseon, becoming [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]]. In 1401, the Joseon Dynasty was officially admitted into a [[tribute|tributary]] relationship with the [[Ming dynasty]] of China.\n\nIn the beginning of Taejong's reign, Taejo refused to relinquish the royal seal that signified the legitimacy of a king's rule. Uncomfortable at the fact that his father did not recognize him as a ''de jure'' ruler because of the family deaths he had caused, Taejong sent several messengers, among them his childhood friend Bak Sun, to recover the royal seal. However, Taejo assassinated every messenger that came into sight of his guards as a sign of his fury at Taejong, who remained unaware of their fates. This episode became known as the [[Case of the Hamhung Envoys]], and the term \"Hamhung envoy\" is still used in the [[Korean language]] to refer to a person who has gone on an assignment and has not been heard from.\n\n==Consolidation of power==\nWith his father unwilling to pass over the royal seal he needed for recognition, Taejong began to initiate policies he believed would prove his intelligence and right to rule. One of his first acts as king was to abolish the privilege enjoyed by the upper echelons of the government and aristocracy to maintain private armies. This effectively severed their ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of men employed in the national military.\n\nTaejong's next act as king was to revise the law concerning the taxation of land ownership and the documentation of state subjects. Although many aristocrats who benefited from King Taejo's property redistribution laws, from the Gwonmun aristocrats to the members of the Sinjin faction, had managed to avoid taxation by deliberately hiding land they acquired, King Taejong's re-investigation of land ownership in 1405 put an end to such practices. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national income increased twofold. In addition, King Taejong initiated the first population survey in 1413 and ordered the documentation of family names and clans, places of birth and death, and dates of birth and death for all Korean men. All males over the age of 16, whichever class in society they occupied, were also required by law to carry wooden tablets on which their name, birth date, and other information was engraved. Many historians regard this legislation as the predecessor of the Korean resident identification and social security system. It was also effective in preventing men from evading their mandatory military service.\n\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-KeunJeongJeon-02.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall)]]\n\nIn 1399 (the second year of King Jeongjong), Taejong had played an influential role in scrapping the [[Dopyeong Assembly]]\u2014a council of the old government that held a monopoly on court power during the waning years of the Goryeo Dynasty\u2014in favor of the [[State Council of Joseon]], a new branch of central administration that revolved around the king and his edicts. After passing the subject documentation and taxation laws, King Taejong issued a decree that decisions passed by the Euijeong Department could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom in which court ministers and advisers made decisions by debating and negotiating among themselves, with the king as an onlooker, and thus brought royal power to new heights. Shortly afterward, Taejong also created a branch of the government, known as the [[Sinmun Office]], to hear cases in which subjects felt they had been exploited or treated unfairly by government officials or aristocrats.\n\nIn 1418, Taejong abdicated. Two months later, in August, [[Sejong]] ascended to the throne. However, Taejong retained certain powers at court, particularly regarding military matters, until he died in 1422. King Sejong was an effective military planner. In May 1419, under the advice and guidance of his father, he embarked on the [[\u014cei Invasion|Gihae Eastern Expedition]] against Japanese pirates who had been operating out of [[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]]. (Before the Gihae expedition, Korea had cleared out pirates in 1389 and 1396.)\n\nIn September 1419, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of Tsushima, Sadamori, capitulated to the Joseon court. In 1443, The [[Treaty of Gyehae]] was signed, in which the Daimyo was granted the right to conduct trade with Korea on 50 ships per year, in exchange for sending tribute to Korea and helping stop any Japanese coastal pirate raid on Korean ports.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title= Korea\n |publisher= Routledge/Curzon\n |date=September 1999\n |isbn=978-0-7007-0464-4\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA255&dq=kyehae+treaty&q=kyehae%20treaty\n |pages= 594\n |last1=Pratt |first1=Keith L.\n |last2=Rutt  |first2=Richard\n |last3=Hoare |first3=James\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n |title= The Cambridge history of Japan\n |volume=3\n |publisher= Cambridge University Press\n |date= April 27, 1990\n |isbn=978-0-521-22354-6\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lCd4reJRaG8C&pg=PA442&dq=kyehae+treaty&q=kyehae%20treaty\n |pages= 748\n |last1=Yamamura |first1=K\u014dz\u014d\n |last2=Hall     |first2=John Whitney\n}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=112816&v=42 \uacc4\ud574\uc57d\uc870 \u7678\u4ea5\u7d04\u689d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610053214/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=112816&v=42 |date=2011-06-10 }}[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Britannica]]</ref><ref>{{in lang|ko}}[http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=236670&v=42 \uacc4\ud574\uc870\uc57d \u7678\u4ea5\u7d04\u689d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610053227/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=236670&v=42 |date=2011-06-10 }} [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]</ref>\n\nOn the northern border, Sejong established four forts and six posts ([[Hangul]]: \uc0ac\uad70\uc721\uc9c4; [[Hanja]]: \u56db\u90e1\u516d\u93ad) to safeguard his people from the hostile Chinese and [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] (who later became the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]) living in Manchuria. In 1433, he sent [[Kim Jong-seo (general)|Kim Jong-seo]] ({{lang-ko|\uae40\uc885\uc11c}}; [[Hanja]]: \u91d1\u5b97\u745e), a prominent general, north to destroy the Jurchens. Kim's military campaign captured several castles, pushed north, and restored Korean territory, roughly the present-day border between North Korea and China.<ref><<\ucc45\ud55c\uad8c\uc73c\ub85c \uc77d\ub294 \uc138\uc885\ub300\uc655\uc2e4\ub85d>>(Learning Sejong Silok in one book) {{ISBN|978-89-01-07754-3}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of Sejong, Korea saw technological advances in [[natural science]], [[agriculture]], [[literature]], and [[traditional medicine]]. Because of his success, Sejong received the title \"King Sejong the Great of Joseon\". His most remembered contribution is the creation of [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet, in 1443. Before that, Korean literati had used the [[Hanja]] writing system\u2014traditional Chinese characters with Korean pronunciation and meaning\u2014and a written language known as [[Hanmun]], which was basically [[Classical Chinese]], for official court documents. Everyday written use of Hanja and Hanmun ended gradually in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\n==Six martyred ministers==\nAfter King Sejong's death, his son [[Munjong of Joseon|Munjong]] continued his legacy but died of illness in 1452, two years after becoming king. Munjong's son [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]] then became king at the age of 12, but his uncle [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]] deposed him and took control of the government himself, becoming the seventh king of Joseon in 1455. After [[Six martyred ministers|six ministers loyal to Danjong]] tried to assassinate Sejo in order to return Danjong to the throne, Sejo executed the six ministers and also killed Danjong, who was in exile. Despite having snatched the throne from his young nephew, Sejo proved to be an able ruler. He strengthened the administrative system, enabling the government to determine exact population numbers and to mobilize troops effectively. He also revised land ordinances to improve the national economy and encouraged the publication of books. Most importantly, he compiled the Grand Code for State Administration, which became the cornerstone of dynastic administration and provided the first written form of constitutional law in Korea.\n\nSejo's son [[Yejong of Joseon|Yejong]] succeeded him to become the eighth king, but died two years later in 1469. Yejong's nephew [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] then ascended to the throne. His reign was marked by prosperity, economic growth, and the rise of [[neo-Confucian]] scholars called [[Sarim]], who were encouraged by Seongjong to enter court politics. Seongjong established Hongmungwan (\ud64d\ubb38\uad00, \u5f18\u6587\u9928), a royal library and advisory council composed of Confucian scholars, with whom he discussed philosophy and government policies. He ushered in a cultural golden age that rivaled King Sejong's reign, with the publication of numerous books on geography, ethics, and other topics. He also launched several military campaigns against the Jurchens to stabilize the northern border.\n\n==Literati purges==\n{{Main|Korean literati purges|Jungjong coup}}\n\nSeongjong's son [[Yeonsangun]], whose reign was marked by [[Korean Literati Purges|a series of bloody purges of neo-Confucian scholars]] between 1498 and 1506, is often considered{{Who|date=January 2016}} the worst tyrant in the Joseon Dynasty. His behavior became erratic after he learned that his biological mother was not Queen Jung-hyeon but deposed Consort Yoon, who had been forced to drink poison after poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines out of jealousy and leaving a scratch mark on Seongjong's face. When he was shown a piece of clothing allegedly stained with blood that his mother had vomited after drinking poison, he beat to death two of the concubines who had accused Consort Yoon and pushed Grand Queen Insu, who died afterward. He executed government officials who supported Consort Yoon's death, along with their families; he also executed Sarim scholars for writing texts critical of Sejo's usurpation of the throne. He seized a thousand women from the provinces to serve as palace entertainers and appropriated the [[Seonggyungwan]], the Royal University, as a personal pleasure ground. He abolished Hongmungwan and the Office of Censors, whose function was to criticize inappropriate actions and policies of the king. He banned the use of Hangul after commoners criticized him with posters written in that alphabet. After twelve years, he was deposed in a coup that placed his half-brother [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]] on the throne in 1506.\n\nJungjong was a fundamentally weak king because of the circumstances that placed him on the throne, but his reign also saw significant reforms led by his minister [[Jo Gwang-jo]], the charismatic leader of Sarim scholars. He established a local self-government system called [[Hyang'yak]] to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit; sought to reduce the gap between rich and poor by distributing land to farmers more equally and by limiting the amount of land and the number of slaves that one could own; promulgated Confucian writings widely with vernacular translations; and reduced the number of bureaucrats. According to [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], no official dared to take a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because Jo applied the law so strictly. These radical reforms were very popular with commoners but were fiercely opposed by the conservative officials who had helped to put Jungjong on the throne. They plotted to make Jungjong doubt Jo's loyalty by writing \"Jo will become the king\" (\uc8fc\ucd08\uc704\uc655, \u8d70\u8096\u7232\u738b) with honey on leaves, so that caterpillars left behind the phrase like a supernatural manifestation. Jo was executed, and most of his reform measures died with him in the [[Korean Literati Purges#Third Literati Purge of 1519|Third Literati Purge of 1519]]. For nearly 50 years afterward, court politics were marred by bloody and chaotic struggles between factions backing rival consorts and princes. In-laws of the royal family wielded great power and contributed to much of the corruption.\n\n==Factional struggle==\n{{Main|Sarim}}\n\nThe [[Sarim]] faction, which suffered a series of political defeats during the reign of [[Yeonsangun]], [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]], gained control of the government under [[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]], but was soon split into a [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Western faction]] and an [[Easterners|Eastern faction]], which in turn split into [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northern]] and [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southern]] factions. The Western faction also eventually split into the Old Learning and New Learning factions. Changes in power between these factions were often accomplished with charges of treason and accompanied by bloody purges, initiating a cycle of revenge.\n\nOne example is the Gichuk [[Treason Case of 1589]] (\uae30\ucd95\uc625\uc0ac), in which an Easterner, Jeong Yeo-rip, was accused of conspiracy to start a rebellion. Jeong had formed a society with a group of supporters who had received military training to fight against Japanese marauders. There is still dispute about the nature and purpose of Jeong's group, which reflected a desire for a classless society and spread throughout the Honam region.

The only job of the Korean navy was to secure the maritime trade against the pirates. The navy maintained superiority over the pirates by using advanced gunpowder technologies, such as cannons and [[fire arrows]] (e.g., [[singijeon]] deployed by [[hwacha]]).\n\nDuring [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592 to 1598]], Japanese warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], hoping to conquer [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] China with Portuguese guns, invaded Korea with his [[daimy\u014d]] and their troops in 1592 and 1597. Factional divisions in the Joseon court, inability to assess Japanese military capability, and failed attempts at diplomacy led to poor preparation on Joseon's part. Using European firearms, the Japanese were able to occupy most of the southern peninsula within months, with both [[Pyongyang]] and Hanseong (present-day Seoul) captured. According to the [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], the Japanese were joined by rebelling Korean [[slavery|slaves]], who burned down the palace of [[Gyeongbokgung]] and its storehouse of slave records.<ref>[http://sillok.history.go.kr/inspection/insp_king.jsp?id=wna_12505003_006 \u5ba3\u7956\u5be6\u9304\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u5e74 (1592) \u4e94\u6708\u58ec\u620c (May 3)] \"\u5371\u4ea1\u8feb\u81f3, \u541b\u81e3\u4e4b\u9593, \u4f55\u53ef\u6709\u96b1? \u5927\u62b5\u6536\u62fe\u4eba\u5fc3\u7232\u4e0a\u3002 \u8fd1\u4f86\u5bae\u4eba\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002 \u5167\u9700\u53f8\u4eba, \u5047\u7a31\u5bae\u7269, \u800c\u7a4d\u6028\u65bc\u6c11\u3002 \u4eca\u65e5\u751f\u8b8a\u4e4b\u7531, \u7686\u7de3\u738b\u5b50\u5bae\u4eba\u4f5c\u5f0a, \u6545\u4eba\u5fc3\u6028\u53db, \u8207\u502d\u540c\u5fc3\u77e3\u3002 \u805e\u8cca\u4e4b\u4f86\u4e5f, \u8a00: \u2018\u6211\u4e0d\u6bba\u6c5d\u8f29, \u6c5d\u541b\u8650\u6c11, \u6545\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u2019 \u4e91\u6211\u6c11\u4ea6\u66f0: \u2018\u502d\u4ea6\u4eba\u4e5f, \u543e\u7b49\u4f55\u5fc5\u68c4\u5bb6\u800c\u907f\u4e5f?\u2019 \u8acb\u8a85\u5167\u9700\u53f8\u4f5c\u5f0a\u4eba, \u4e14\u514d\u5e73\u5b89\u9053\u7a4d\u5e74\u900b\u6b20\u3002\" \"\u6176\u5c19\u9053\u4eba\u7686\u53db\u4e91, \u7136\u8036?\"-[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty|The annals of the Choson Dynasty]]-[[National Institute of Korean History]]</ref>\n\n[[Righteous Army|Local resistance]], however, slowed down the Japanese advance, and decisive naval victories by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] left control of sea routes in Korean hands, severely hampering Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] China intervened on the side of the Koreans, sending a large force in 1593 that helped push back the Japanese. During the war, the Koreans developed powerful firearms, high-quality gunpowder, and [[Turtle ship]]s.\n\nThe Joseon and Ming forces defeated the Japanese, who retreated back to their homeland, but victory came at a deep price. Farmlands were devastated, irrigation dikes were destroyed, and villages and towns were burned down. The population was first plundered and then dispersed, and tens of thousands of skilled workers ([[celadon]] ware makers, craftsmen, artisans, etc.) were either killed or kidnapped and taken to Japan as captives to help the Japanese develop their crafts. The Japanese also pilfered many thousands of Joseon historical and royal boiis, many of which are preserved in Japanese museums.\n\nIn 1598, the Japanese withdrew their troops from Korea after Hideyoshi died. As the Japanese retreated, Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered a vigorous pursuit by the Koreans. However, Yi was killed by a single bullet in the [[Battle of Noryang]] on December 16, 1598.\n\nAs a result of the wars, the Japanese took the ears and noses of some 38,000 Koreans as trophies (a common [[samurai]] practice) and built the [[Mimizuka]] monument in [[Ky\u014dto]]. The long war reduced the productive capacity of farmlands from 1,708,000 kyol (a land unit) to 541,000 kyol. Following the war, relations between Korea and Japan were completely suspended, and Japan was cut off from the technology of continental Asia. After the death of Hideyoshi, however, negotiations between the Korean court and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] were carried out via the Japanese lord on Tsushima.\n\nIn 1604, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], needing to restore commercial relations with Korea in order to regain access to the technology of the mainland, met Korea's demands and released some 3,000 captive Koreans. As a result, in 1607, a Korean mission visited [[Edo]], and diplomatic and trade relations were restored on a limited basis.\n\n==Manchu invasions==\nFollowing these events, the Korean kingdom became increasingly [[isolationist]]. In addition, the Ming dynasty was weakened, partly because of the war between Korea and Japan, and the new [[Qing dynasty]] was established. The Koreans decided to build tighter borders, exert more control over inter-border traffic, and wait out the initial turbulence of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] overthrow of the Ming.\n\nDespite these limits, Korea had extensive trade with [[Mongolia]], [[North Asia|Northern Asia]], China, and Japan. However, at times, trade with Japan was limited to missions appointed by the king in order to prevent piracy and maintain orderly trade, which had been a problem even in the Goryeo period.\n\nKorea was twice invaded by the Manchus, in 1627 (the [[First Manchu invasion of Korea|First Manchu Invasion of Korea]]) and 1637 (the [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea|Second Manchu Invasion of Korea]]). Korea surrendered to the Manchus and became a tributary state of the Qing dynasty, which at that time involved two-way trade missions with China.\n\n==Political factions==\n{{main|Political factions in Joseon Dynasty}}\n\nThroughout the Joseon era, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance of the political system. In the earliest years of Joseon, tension between the capital faction and the [[Yeongnam]]-based [[Sarim]] faction predominated. Village [[Seowon]], which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elites. In areas where the Western faction dominated, key figures of Western thought were enshrined. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the [[Easterners (Korean political faction)|Eastern faction]] (''Dong-in'') and [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Western faction]] (''Seo-in''). The Eastern faction in turn split under the reign of [[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]] between the hard-line [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northern faction]] (''Buk-in'') and the moderate [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southern faction]] (''Nam-in'').<ref>Lee (1984), p. 221.</ref> The Western faction later split between the [[Old Learning]] (''Noron'') and the [[Young Learning]] (''Soron'') factions.\n\nThese splits were often driven by questions of royal succession or appropriate royal conduct. For example, the split between the Northerners and Southerners was driven by questions involving the proper successor to Seonjo, who had no legitimate son. The Northerners came to support the [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghaegun]]; accordingly, they flourished under his reign (1608\u20131623) but were swept from power by the Westerners after the succession of [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]].\n\nUnder the reigns of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] in the 18th century, the kings pursued a strict policy of equality, favoring no faction over another.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 223.</ref> However, during Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged between the [[Byeokpa]] and [[Sipa (Korean Faction)|Sipa]], two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes toward Yeongjo's murder of his son, who was also Jeongjo's father. In the 19th century, the playing field shifted once more, and in-law families rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the [[Andong Kim clan]] was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang Jo clan.\n\nWhen [[Heungseon Daewongun]] took power, factional politics started to decline, and disappeared by the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Late Joseon period==\n[[File:Bifyu 8.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Hwaseong Fortress]] in [[Suwon]].]]\nAfter the Manchu invasions, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]] led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty. [[Sukjong of Joseon|King Sukjong]] and his son [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]] tried to solve the problems resulting from factional politics.\n\nYeongjo's grandson, [[Jeongjo of Joseon|King Jeongjo]], made various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing [[Kyujanggak]], an imperial library. Its purpose was to improve the cultural and political position of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to run the nation. King Jeongjo also spearheaded bold new social initiatives, opening government positions to those who would have previously been barred because of their social status. He had the support of many [[Silhak]] scholars, and in addition, the Silhak scholars supported Jeongjo's regal power. King Jeongjo's reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture.\n\nDuring the 19th century, drought and floods alternately struck rice fields and farms in Korea and caused great famines. Making matters worse, rulers increased taxes on crops and required more free labor from the starving peasants. Anti-government and anti-landlord sentiment boiled over into violent uprisings.\n\nIn 1812, [[Hong Gyeong-nae]] led the peasants of Gasan in the northern part of Korea in an armed rebellion and occupied the region for several months. An army was sent to quell the rebellion but only succeeded after a savage scorched-earth campaign. Throughout Korea, all the way to [[Jeju Island]], peasants continued to defy the king and ministers in [[Seoul]], as well as the local nobility and wealthy landlords. In 1862, a group of farmers in [[Jinju]], in [[Gyeongsang Province]], rose up against their provincial officials and the wealthy landowners in response to exploitation of destitute farmers. The whole of Joseon was plunged in confusion. [[Choe Je-u]] (\ucd5c\uc81c\uc6b0, \u5d14\u6fdf\u611a, 1824\u20131894) established the ideology of [[Donghak]] (Eastern learning) in the 1860s. [[Roman Catholic]]ism was also introduced in this period, but [[Christianity]] in all its forms was brutally oppressed by the Korean government until the late 1880s.\n\nIn 1863, [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] took the throne. His father, Regent [[Heungseon Daewongun]], ruled for him until Gojong reached adulthood. Daewongun is largely said to have been responsible for the brutal suppression of Christianity in Korea during his regency. In the mid-1860s, he was the main proponent of isolationism and the instrument of the persecution of native and foreign Catholics, a policy that led directly to the [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|French campaign against Korea in 1866]]. The early years of his rule also witnessed an effort to restore the dilapidated [[Gyeongbok Palace]], the seat of royal authority. During Daewongun's reign, factional politics and power wielded by the Andong Kim clan disappeared.\n\nIn 1873, King Gojong announced his direct royal rule. With the subsequent retirement of Daewongun, Queen Min (later called [[Empress Myeongseong]]) gained complete control over her court and placed her family in high positions.\n\n===Western intervention===\n{{See also|French Campaign against Korea, 1866|United States expedition to Korea (1871)|Treaty of Ganghwa}}\n\nThe French campaign against Korea in 1866 is also known as Byeonginyangyo (Korean: \ubcd1\uc778\uc591\uc694, Western Disturbance of the Byeong-in Year). It refers to the French occupation of [[Ganghwa Island]] in retaliation for the execution of French [[Jesuit]] priests proselytizing illicitly in Korea. The campaign, which lasted nearly six weeks, was the first armed encounter between Korea and a Western power. The overall result was a French retreat and a check on France's influence in the region. The violent encounter also confirmed Korea in its isolationism for another decade.\n\nThe [[United States expedition to Korea (1871)|United States expedition to Korea in 1871]], also known as Sinmiyangyo (Korean: \uc2e0\ubbf8\uc591\uc694, Western Disturbance of the Sinmi Year), was the first American military action in Korea. It, too, took place predominantly on and around Ganghwa Island. The American military expeditionary force arrived to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea, to ascertain the fate of the [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'']] merchant ship, and to establish a treaty assuring aid for shipwrecked sailors. The conservative nature of the Joseon government and the assertiveness of the Americans led to a misunderstanding between the two parties that changed a diplomatic expedition into an armed conflict. The United States won a minor military victory, but because the Koreans refused to open the country to the Americans (and the U.S. forces in Korea did not have the authority or strength to press the issue), the United States failed to secure its diplomatic objectives.\n\nIn 1875, the [[Japanese gunboat Un'y\u014d|''Un'y\u014d'']], a small Japanese warship, was dispatched to survey coastal waters without Korean permission. It attacked a Korean port and withdrew back to Japan. The Japanese took the opportunity to demand a treaty. The [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] became the first [[unequal treaty]] signed by Korea; it gave extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens in Korea, forced the Korean government to open three ports\u2014[[Busan]], [[Incheon]], and [[Wonsan]]\u2014to Japanese and foreign trade, and made Korea establish its independence from China in foreign relations.\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Taegukgi.jpg|thumb|An early version of the [[Korean flag]].]]\n\nIn the 19th century, tensions mounted between [[Qing China]] and [[Japan]], culminating in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895). Much of this war was fought on the Korean Peninsula. Japan, having acquired Western military technology after the [[Meiji Restoration]], had forced Joseon to sign the Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876. Japan encroached on Korean territory in search of fish, iron ore, and natural resources. It also established a strong economic presence, heralding the beginning of Japanese imperial expansion in East Asia.\n\n===Imo Rebellion and Gapsin Coup===\n{{main|Imo Incident|Gapsin Coup}}\nAs the dynasty declined, the king began to rely on newer, rifle-using armies. They were paid well, and members of the old army, who used spears and old [[matchlock]]s, lost much of their pay. The old army revolted in response. Heungseon Daewongun was restored to power, but the Qing general [[Yuan Shikai]] soon had him abducted by Chinese troops and taken to China, thus foiling his return. Four years later, Daewongun returned to Korea.\n\nOn December 4, 1884, five revolutionaries led a small army to [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]]'s brother's house and initiated a [[coup d'\u00e9t\u00e2t]]. It failed in three days. Some coup leaders, including [[Kim Ok-gyun]], fled to Japan, and others were executed.\n\n===Donghak Peasant Revolution===\n{{Main|Donghak Peasant Revolution}}\n\nThe [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] was an anti-government, anti-[[yangban]], and anti-foreign campaign.\n\nThe peasants demanded land redistribution, lower taxes, democracy, and human rights. Taxes were so high that most farmers had been forced to sell their ancestral homesteads to rich landowners at bargain prices. As a result, the peasant class developed intense anti-Japanese and anti-yangban sentiments. The immediate causes of the rebellion were the actions of [[Jo Byong-gap]], a government official whose rule was viewed by some as tyrannical and corrupt. On January 11, 1894, peasant leader [[Jeon Bong-jun]] defeated the government forces at the battle of [[Jeongeup|Go-bu]], and Jo's properties were handed out to the peasants. In the meantime, the Joseon government army attacked Jeonju, and the government and the peasant army concluded an agreement. However, the Joseon government then asked the Chinese government for urgent assistance in ending the revolt. After notifying the Japanese in accordance with the [[Convention of Tientsin]], China sent troops into Korea. It was the catalyst for the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nIn late June 1894, pro-Japanese forces hatched a plan to wipe out the peasant army in cooperation with the Japanese troops stationed in [[Incheon]] and [[Seoul]]. On October 16, the peasant army moved toward [[Gongju]] for the final battle, which was a trap: The Japanese and the pro-Japanese government troops were waiting for them. The peasant army was defeated in the [[Battle of Ugeumchi]]. The Japanese had cannons and other modern weapons, whereas the Korean peasants were armed only with bows and arrows, spears, swords, and some [[flintlock]] muskets. A few months later, Jeon was captured and executed.\n\nThe revolution failed, but many of the peasants' grievances would later be addressed through the [[Gabo Reform]].\n\n===Eulmi Incident===\n{{main|Eulmi Incident}}\n\nIn 1895, Empress Myeongseong (referred to as \"Queen Min\" by the United States<ref name=\"queen min\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/11/10/106073098.pdf Characteristics of Queen of Corea] ''[[The New York Times]]'' Nov 10, 1895</ref> and Japan) was assassinated by Japanese agents;<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2004/11/09/200411090500053/200411090500053_1.html\n |script-title=ko:\uc77c\ubcf8\uc778 \ud3ed\ub3c4\uac00 \uac00\uc2b4\uc744 \uc138 \ubc88 \uc9d3\ubc1f\uace0 \uc77c\ubcf8\ub3c4\ub85c \ub09c\uc790\ud588\ub2e4\n |newspaper=[[Dong-a Ilbo]]\n |author=Park Jong-hyo (\ubc15\uc885\ud6a8)\n |date= 2002-01-01\n |issue= 508\n |pages=472\u2013485\n |language=Korean\n}}</ref> she had tried to counter Japanese interference in Korea and was considering turning to Russia or China for support. The Japanese minister to Korea, [[Miura Gor\u014d]], orchestrated the plot against her. A group of Japanese agents, along with the [[Hullyeondae]] Army,<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\"/> entered the royal palace in Seoul, and an agent killed the empress and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.\n\n===Establishment of the Korean Empire===\n{{Main|Korean Empire}}\n[[File:Dokripmun.jpg|thumb|[[Independence Gate]], built in 1896]]\n\nThe Chinese defeat in the 1894 war led to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] between [[China]] and [[Japan]], which officially guaranteed Korea's independence from its tributary status with China. For Japan, it was a step toward regional [[hegemony]] in Korea. After that, Korea built the [[Independence Gate]] and stopped paying tributes to the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Joseon court, pressured by encroachment from larger powers, felt the need to reinforce national integrity and declared the [[Korean Empire]] in 1897. [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] assumed the title of emperor in order to assert Korea's independence. He tried to promote the [[Gwangmu Reform]], but failed because of opposition from the general populace and the Japanese.\n\nTechnically, 1897 marks the end of the Joseon period, as the official name of the empire was changed. However, the dynasty continued to reign, albeit perturbed by Japanese interventions.\n\n===Japanese occupation===\nIn a complicated series of maneuvers and counter-maneuvers, Japan pushed back a Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in 1905. After the conclusion of the 1904\u20131905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], the way was open for Japan to take control of Korea.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Eulsa Treaty|Protectorate Treaty]] in 1905, Korea became a [[protectorate]] of Japan. [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] became the first resident general of Korea. He was assassinated by a [[Korean independence activist]], [[An Jung-geun]], in 1909 at the train station at [[Harbin]].\n\nFollowing the Protectorate Treaty, Gojong sent representatives to the [[Hague Peace Conference#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Peace Convention]] of 1907 to try to re-assert his sovereignty over Korea. Although the Korean representatives were blocked by the Japanese delegates, they did not give up, and later held interviews with newspapers. The Japanese forced Gojong to abdicate, and his son [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]] succeeded to the throne.\n\nIn 1910, in the face of opposition from many Koreans, the [[Japanese Empire]] [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] Korea by force.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Korea]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Joseon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Joseon Dynasty}}\n[[Category:Joseon dynasty|.]]\n[[Category:History of Korea]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: north-south \u2192 north\u2013south, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Joseon_dynasty"}

The terrace was initially built in the 1870s by the builder George Frederick Tippett, as single family residences, but from the 1880s the houses began to be subdivided into flats. By 1928 the neighbourhood was described as \"rapidly becoming poorer\", and by 1935 as a \"largely slum area\". The gentrification of [[Notting Hill]] in the 1980s and 1980s greatly improved the character of the building, which now forms a part of one of London's most fashionable neighbourhoods.\n\n==History==\nThe terrace was initially built in the 1870s by the builder [[George Frederick Tippett]], who also developed much of the rest of the neighbourhood. The houses were intended as single family homes for the well-to-do but from the beginning it proved difficult to attract wealthy buyers to the area, and as early as 1888 the buildings began to be subdivided into flats.<ref name=\"O'Malley p.33\">O'Malley, p.33</ref>\n\nIn 1885 Tippett was declared bankrupt. He attributed his failure to \"his inability to let a large portion of his property and to the pressure of secured creditors\". Gradually the character of the buildings changed as wealthier tenants left the area.\n\n===20th century===\nBy 1928 the neighbourhood was described as \"rapidly becoming poorer\", and by 1935 as a \"largely slum area... large houses turned into one-room tenements and small flats\". \n\nFurther decline set in as many residents moved away during [[World War II]] to escape [[The Blitz]].<ref name=\"O'Malley p.33\"/> One of the buildings at the end of the terrace was destroyed during a bombing raid; it has since been rebuilt in the modern style. The same raid severely damaged other neighbouring buildings including [[All Saints Notting Hill|All Saints Church]].\n\nIn 1953 1-9 Colville Gardens was bought by Fernbank Investments Ltd (a subsidiary of Davies Investments Ltd) for \u00a38,000.<ref name=\"O'Malley p.33\" /> Some questionable business practices followed, mostly involving attempts to displace sitting tenants (in some cases by intimidation) which however significantly increased the income from the property. At the same time the quality of the building deteriorated, and in around 1966 some of the residents began to approach the Council in order to attempt to improve living conditions.\n\nIn 1967 Fernbank Investments declared bankruptcy. Its owner, Bowen Davies, took his own life, saying that he had \"caused suffering... to very many, and the burden on my conscience is intolerable\".<ref>O'Malley, 38</ref> \n\nIn October 1967 1-9 Colville Gardens was sold to another investment company, Trade and General Investments (Bahamas) Ltd, for \u00a365,000.<ref>O'Malley, 101</ref> The building continued to deteriorate and in February 1969 it was again sold, this time to Cledro Developments for \u00a3120,000, whose Director Robert Gubay described conditions in the buildings as \"truly terrible\".<ref>O'Malley, \u00b4103</ref> In 1970 the block was sold to Crown Agents of Overseas territories, who renamed the building Trident House. The building was then again sold, changing hands several times before being purchased by Elkington's (PIF) Ltd in 1972 and renamed \"Pinehurst Court\". Elkington's began to invest in the building, selling off the flats on long leases, mostly to the occupying tenants.<ref>O'Malley, 104</ref>\n\n===Modern Revival===\nOver recent years the quality of the building gradually improved, reflecting the general revival of Notting Hill.\n\nToday the building comprises around 105 one and two bedroom flats, mostly leased to private tenants on long leases of 100 years or more. The building is currently well maintained and forms a part of one of London's most fashionable neighbourhoods.\n\n==References==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=U6p0VR12ZSgC&pg=PA41&dq=colville+gardens&hl=en&ei=bRasTtqgOIec-waI6onMDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=colville%20gardens&f=false Holmes, Chris, p.41, ''Housing, Equality and Choice'' ] Retrieved October 2011\n* O'Malley, Jan, ''The Politics of Community Action in Notting Hill'', Spokesman Press, 1977\n*''The Portobello and St. Quintin estates'', Survey of London: volume 37: Northern Kensington (1973)\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49881#s7/ History of the Portobello and St Quintin Estates] Retrieved February 20, 2010\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{coord|51.5157|-0.2029|type:landmark_region:GB-KEC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Notting Hill]]\n[[Category:History of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox building\n| name        = Pinehurst Court\n| native_name = \n| former_names         =\n| alternate_names      = 1-3 Colville Gardens\n| image                = PinehurstCourt.jpg\n| alt                  = \n| caption              = Pinehurst Court, showing [[All Saints Notting Hill|All Saints]] church in the background\n| map_type             = \n| map_alt              = \n| map_caption          = \n| altitude             = \n| building_type        = Mansion Block\n| architectural_style  = [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]\n| structural_system    = Timber frame, brick, stucco.\n| cost                 = \n| ren_cost             =\n| location             = [[Notting Hill]]\n| location_town        =[[London]]\n| location_country     =[[United Kingdom]]\n| address              = \n| client               = \n| owner                = \n| current_tenants      = \n| landlord             = \n| coordinates          = \n| start_date           = c1870s\n| completion_date      = c1870s\n| inauguration_date    =\n| renovation_date      = \n| demolition_date      = \n| destruction_date     = \n| height               = \n| diameter             = \n| other_dimensions     = \n| floor_count          = \n| floor_area           = \n| main_contractor      = \n| architect            = George Frederick Tippett\n| architecture_firm    =\n| structural_engineer  = \n| services_engineer    = \n| civil_engineer       = \n| other_designers      = Builder: George Frederick Tippett\n| quantity_surveyor    = \n| awards               = \n| ren_architect        =\n| ren_firm             =\n| ren_str_engineer     = \n| ren_serv_engineer    = \n| ren_civ_engineer     = \n| ren_oth_designers    = \n| ren_qty_surveyor     = \n| ren_awards           = \n| url                  = \n| references           = \n}}\n\n'''Pinehurst Court''' is a portered [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansion block at 1-9 [[Colville Gardens]], just off Colville Terrace and near the [[Portobello Market]] in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]], [[England]].

Jos]''' {{IPAc-en|'|d\u0292|o\u02d0|s}} is a city in the [[Middle Belt]] of [[Nigeria]]. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 census.<ref name=\"nigerianstat.gov.ng\"/> Popularly called \"'''J-Town'''\", it is the administrative capital and largest city of [[Plateau State]].\n\nThe city is located on the [[Jos Plateau]] at about {{convert|1238|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level. During [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial rule]], Jos was an important centre for [[Tin|tin mining]] and is the trading hub of the state as commercial activities are steadily increasing.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] (circa 1000&nbsp;BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-62-74.jpg|thumb|left|Early British settlement in Jos, 1905]]\nAccording to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt,<ref>History of Jos and political development of Nigeria; Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt</ref> the area known as Jos today was inhabited by [[indigenous]] [[ethnic groups of Nigeria|ethnic groups]] who were mostly farmers. According to Billy J. Dudley,<ref>Billy J. Dudley. Parties and politics in Northern Nigeria</ref> the British colonialists used direct rule for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the [[Fulani]] [[emirate]]s where indirect rule was used. According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara,<ref>Samuel N Nwabara; The Fulani conquest and the rule of the Hausa kingdom of Northern  Nigeria (1804\u20131900){{Page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref> the [[Fula people|Fulani]] empire controlled most of [[northern Nigeria]], except the Plateau province and the [[Berom people|Berom]], [[Mwaghavul language|Mwaghavul]], [[Ngas language|Ngas]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic groups. It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa\u2013Fulani|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], thus making Jos a cosmopolitan city.\n\nAccording to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1994 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was Gwosh which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] wrongly pronounced Gwosh as Jos and it stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com|title=Petition Online - Petition Online has been retired|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Another version was that \"Jos\" came from the word \"Jasad\" meaning body. To distinguish it from the hill tops, it was called \"Jas\", which was mis-pronounced by the British as \"Jos\". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as \"Tin City\". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967, and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975.\n[[File:CENTRAL MOSQUE JOS NIGERIA - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Jos Central Mosque]]\n[[File:Gunshot victim and mother.jpg|thumb|A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots]]\nJos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[Human migration|migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This \"melting pot\" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the \"home of peace and tourism\". \n\n==Religious violence==\nJos is inhabited by predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] communities, but clashes have occurred between [[Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]]. In September 2001, [[2001 Jos riots|riots]] occurred in Jos between the divided and Christian and [[Muslim]] populations, in which about a thousand people were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|title = A Deadly Cycle of Ethno-religious violence|last = Krause|first = Jana|date = 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015|pages = 13|isbn = 978-2-9700771-0-7|publisher = Geneva Declaration}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 17\u201318}}</ref> In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, [[Joshua Dariye]], was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. \n[[File:Residential Area In Tudun Wada, Jos, Plateau State (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Residential area in Jos]]\nIn [[2008 Jos riots|November 2008]] and [[2010 Jos riots|January 2010]], further riots occurred in Jos.

The city proper lies between Jos north and Jos south. Jos east houses the prestigious National Center For Remote Sensing. Jos north is the state capital and the area where most commercial activities of the state takes place, although due to the recent communal clashes a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos south. The Governor's office is located in an area in Jos North called \"Jise\" in Berom language, \"Gise\" in Afizere (Jarawa) language or \"Tudun-Wada\" in Hausa language. Jos south is the seat of the Deputy Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos south also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos north is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital.

Jos]''' {{IPAc-en|'|d\u0292|o\u02d0|s}} is a city in the [[Middle Belt]] of [[Nigeria]]. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 census.<ref name=\"nigerianstat.gov.ng\"/> Popularly called \"'''J-Town'''\", it is the administrative capital and largest city of [[Plateau State]].\n\nThe city is located on the [[Jos Plateau]] at about {{convert|1238|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level. During [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial rule]], Jos was an important centre for [[Tin|tin mining]] and is the trading hub of the state as commercial activities are steadily increasing.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] (circa 1000&nbsp;BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-62-74.jpg|thumb|left|Early British settlement in Jos, 1905]]\nAccording to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt,<ref>History of Jos and political development of Nigeria; Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt</ref> the area known as Jos today was inhabited by [[indigenous]] [[ethnic groups of Nigeria|ethnic groups]] who were mostly farmers. According to Billy J. Dudley,<ref>Billy J. Dudley. Parties and politics in Northern Nigeria</ref> the British colonialists used direct rule for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the [[Fulani]] [[emirate]]s where indirect rule was used. According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara,<ref>Samuel N Nwabara; The Fulani conquest and the rule of the Hausa kingdom of Northern  Nigeria (1804\u20131900){{Page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref> the [[Fula people|Fulani]] empire controlled most of [[northern Nigeria]], except the Plateau province and the [[Berom people|Berom]], [[Mwaghavul language|Mwaghavul]], [[Ngas language|Ngas]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic groups. It was the discovery of [[tin]] by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa\u2013Fulani|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], thus making Jos a cosmopolitan city.\n\nAccording to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1994 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was Gwosh which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] wrongly pronounced Gwosh as Jos and it stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petitiononline.com|title=Petition Online - Petition Online has been retired|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> Another version was that \"Jos\" came from the word \"Jasad\" meaning body. To distinguish it from the hill tops, it was called \"Jas\", which was mis-pronounced by the British as \"Jos\". It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast [[tin]] deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and [[columbite]] were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both [[Port Harcourt]] and [[Lagos]] on the coast, then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as \"Tin City\". It was made capital of [[Benue-Plateau State]] in 1967, and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975.\n[[File:CENTRAL MOSQUE JOS NIGERIA - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Jos Central Mosque]]\n[[File:Gunshot victim and mother.jpg|thumb|A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots]]\nJos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining has led to the influx of [[Human migration|migrant]]s (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This \"melting pot\" of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, [[Plateau State]] is known in Nigeria as the \"home of peace and tourism\". \n\n==Religious violence==\nJos is inhabited by predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] communities, but clashes have occurred between [[Christians]] and [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims]]. In September 2001, [[2001 Jos riots|riots]] occurred in Jos between the divided and Christian and [[Muslim]] populations, in which about a thousand people were killed.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/regional-publications/GD-WP-Jos-deadly-cycle.pdf|title = A Deadly Cycle of Ethno-religious violence|last = Krause|first = Jana|date = 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015|pages = 13|isbn = 978-2-9700771-0-7|publisher = Geneva Declaration}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 17\u201318}}</ref> In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, [[Joshua Dariye]], was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. \n[[File:Residential Area In Tudun Wada, Jos, Plateau State (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Residential area in Jos]]\nIn [[2008 Jos riots|November 2008]] and [[2010 Jos riots|January 2010]], further riots occurred in Jos.

The city proper lies between Jos north and Jos south. Jos east houses the prestigious National Center For Remote Sensing. Jos north is the state capital and the area where most commercial activities of the state takes place, although due to the recent communal clashes a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos south. The Governor's office is located in an area in Jos North called \"Jise\" in Berom language, \"Gise\" in Afizere (Jarawa) language or \"Tudun-Wada\" in Hausa language. Jos south is the seat of the Deputy Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos south also houses prestigious institutions like the [[National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies]] (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute, the Police Staff College, the [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]] television college and the [[Nigerian Film Corporation]]. Jos north is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital.

The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5\u20136 metres height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archivedate=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|title=Prunus domestica Plum, European plum PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122110734/http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|archivedate=2012-11-22}}</ref>\n\nFruits are usually of medium size, between 2 and 7 centimetres in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.\n[[File:Plum blossom on the first day of spring - geograph.org.uk - 1214413.jpg|thumb|Plum flowers]]\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg|thumb|Sloe or blackthorn, ''Prunus spinosa'']]\n\nPlum [[cultivar]]s include:\n* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)\n* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)\n* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])\n* [[Satsuma plum]] (firm red flesh with a red skin)\n* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)\n* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Different plum cultivars\">\nFile:Slivka.JPG|Damsons\nFile:Greengages 0.jpg|Greengages\nFile:Mirabellen.jpg|Mirabelles\nFile:Prunus domestica 'Reine Victoria'.jpg|Victoria plums\n</gallery>\n\nWhen it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5\u20136 metres height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archivedate=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres.

The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.\n[[File:Plum blossom on the first day of spring - geograph.org.uk - 1214413.jpg|thumb|Plum flowers]]\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg|thumb|Sloe or blackthorn, ''Prunus spinosa'']]\n\nPlum [[cultivar]]s include:\n* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)\n* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)\n* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])\n* [[Satsuma plum]] (firm red flesh with a red skin)\n* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)\n* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Different plum cultivars\">\nFile:Slivka.JPG|Damsons\nFile:Greengages 0.jpg|Greengages\nFile:Mirabellen.jpg|Mirabelles\nFile:Prunus domestica 'Reine Victoria'.jpg|Victoria plums\n</gallery>\n\nWhen it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.\n\nIf the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].\n[[File:970718-DriedGoldenPlum-IMG 7527-2.jpg|thumb|Dried yellow plums]]\n\nThe taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[\u0161ljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159\u2013165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Vel\u00ed\u0161ek |author2=Franti\u0161ek Pudil |author3=Ji\u0159\u00ed Dav\u00eddek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463\u2013466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726}}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.\n\nAs with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064\u20131094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum.

The area was settled by nomadic tribes in the Bronze Age, which consolidated in small kingdoms during the Iron Age \u2013 such as the [[Edomites]] and [[Ammon]]ites, with partial areas controlled by the [[Israelites]]. In the classic period, Transjordan came under Greek and later Roman influence. Under the Romans and the Byzantines, Transjordan was home to the [[Decapolis]] in the North, with much of the region being designated as [[Byzantine Arabia]]. Classical kingdoms located in the region of Transjordan, such as the Roman-era [[Nabatean kingdom]], which had its capital in [[Petra]], left particularly dramatic ruins popular today with tourists and filmmakers. The history of Transjordan continued with the [[Caliphate|Muslim empires]] starting in the 7th century, partial crusader control in the mid-Middle Ages (country of [[Oultrejordain]]) and finally, [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)]] since 13th century and the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 16th century until World War I.\n\nWith the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] in 1916 and the consequent British invasion, the area came under the Anglo-Arab ruled [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] East in 1917, which was declared as the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920. Following the French occupation of only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom, [[Interregnum (Transjordan)|Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum]]. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, [[Abdullah's entry into Transjordan|arrived into Transjordan]]. With the [[Transjordan memorandum|British mandate of Transjordan]] in early 1920s, it became the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] under the Hashemite Emir. In 1946, independent [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan]] was formed and shortly admitted to the [[United Nations]] and the [[Arab League]]. In 1948, Jordan fought with the newly born state of Israel over lands of former [[Mandatory Palestine]], effectively gaining control of the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexing]] it with its Palestinian population. Jordan lost West Bank in the 1967 War with Israel, and since became the central base of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) in its struggle against Israel. The alliance between the PLO and the Jordanians, active during the [[War of Attrition]], came to an end in the bloody [[Black September in Jordan]] in 1970, when a civil war between Jordanians and Palestinians (with Syrian Ba'athist support) took thousands of lives. In the aftermath, the defeated PLO was forced out of Jordan together with tens of thousands of its fighters and their Palestinian families, relocating to South Lebanon.\n\n==Ancient history==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nEvidence of human activity in [[Jordan]] dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period. While there is no architectural evidence from this era, archaeologists have found tools, such as flint and basalt hand-axes, knives and scraping implements.\n[[File:Ruins of a Roman temple in Erak al Amir, Jordan.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An old Roman Temple in [[Iraq al-Amir]]]]\nIn the [[Neolithic]] period (8500\u20134500 BC) three major shifts occurred. First, people became [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], living in small villages, and discovering and domesticating new food sources such as cereal grains, peas and lentils, as well as goats. The human population increased to tens of thousands.\n\nSecond, this shift in settlement patterns appears to have been catalyzed by a marked change in climate. The eastern desert, in particular, grew warmer and drier, eventually to the point where it became uninhabitable for most of the year. This watershed climate change is believed to have occurred between 6500 and 5500 BC.\n\nThird, beginning sometime between 5500 and 4500 BC, the inhabitants began to make [[pottery]] from clay rather than plaster. Pottery-making technologies were probably introduced to the area by craftsmen from Mesopotamia.\n\nThe largest Neolithic site in Jordan is at [[Ein Ghazal]] in [[Amman]]. The many buildings were divided into three distinct districts. Houses were rectangular and had several rooms, some with plastered floors. Archaeologists have unearthed [[Plastered human skulls|skulls covered with plaster]] and with bitumen in the eye sockets at sites throughout [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Territories]] and [[Syria]]. A statue discovered at Ein Ghazal is thought to be 8,000 years old. Just over one meter high, it depicts a woman with huge eyes, skinny arms, knobby knees and a detailed rendering of her toes.\n\n{{History of the Levant}}\nDuring the Chalcolithic period (4500\u20133200 BC), copper began to be smelted and used to make axes, arrowheads and hooks. The cultivation of barley, dates, olives and lentils, and the domestication of sheep and goats, rather than hunting, predominated. The lifestyle in the desert was probably very similar to that of modern [[Bedouins]].\n\n[[Teleilat el Ghassul|Tuleitat Ghassul]] is a large Chalcolithic era village located in the [[Jordan|Jordan Valley]]. The walls of its houses were made of sun-dried mud bricks; its roofs of wood, reeds and mud. Some had stone foundations, and many had large central courtyards. The walls are often painted with bright images of masked men, stars, and geometric motifs, which may have been connected to religious beliefs.<ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_ancient.html Jordan \u2013 History \u2013 Ancient Jordan]</ref>\n\nMany of the villages built during the Early Bronze Age (3200\u20131950 BC) included simple water infrastructures, as well as defensive fortifications probably designed to protect against raids by neighboring nomadic tribes.\n\nAt [[Bab al-Dhra]] in [[Wadi `Araba]], archaeologists discovered more than 20,000 shaft tombs with multiple chambers as well as houses of mud-brick containing human bones, pots, jewelry and weapons. Hundreds of [[dolmens]] scattered throughout the mountains have been dated to the late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages.<ref>Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan; an introduction and field guide''. Amman, Jordan: The American Center of Oriental Research. {{ISBN|978-9957-8543-3-1}}</ref>\n\nAlthough writing was developed before 3000 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was generally not used in [[Jordan]], Canaan and Syria until some thousand years later, even though archeological evidence indicates that the [[Jordan]]ians were trading with Egypt and Mesopotamia.\n\nBetween 2300 and 1950 BC, many of the large, fortified hilltop towns were abandoned in favor of either small, unfortified villages or a pastoral lifestyle. There is no consensus on what caused this shift, though it is thought to have been a combination of climatic and political changes that brought an end to the city-state network.\n\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age (1950\u20131550 BC), migration across the Middle East increased. Trading continued to develop between Egypt, Syria, Arabia, Canaan and [[Jordan]], resulting in the spread of technology and other hallmarks of civilization. Bronze, forged from copper and tin, enabled the production of more durable axes, knives, and other tools and weapons. Large, distinct communities seem to have arisen in northern and central [[Jordan]], while the south was populated by a nomadic, Bedouin-type of people known as the [[Shasu]].\n\nNew fortifications appeared at sites like Amman's Citadel, [[Irbid]], and [[Tabaqat Fahl]] (or Pella). Towns were surrounded by ramparts made of earth embankments, and the slopes were covered in hard plaster, making the climb slippery and difficult. Pella was enclosed by massive walls and watch towers.\n\nArchaeologists usually date the end of the Middle Bronze Age to about 1550 BC, when the [[Hyksos]] were driven out of Egypt during the 17th and 18th Dynasties. A number of Middle Bronze Age towns in Canaan and [[Jordan]] were destroyed during this time.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe most prominent Iron Age kingdoms in [[Jordan]] were [[Ammon]], [[Moab]], and [[Edom]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sm7BOubDYcC&pg=PA1&lpg=PP1&output=html B. Mcdonald, Younker Ancient Ammon]</ref> The [[Ammon]]ites had their capital in [[Amman|Rabbath Ammon]]. The [[Moab]]ites settled [[Kerak Governorate]] with their capital at Kir of Moab ([[Kerak]]),<ref>[http://www.studylight.org/dic/sbd/view.cgi?number=T2596 Smith's Bible Dictionary]</ref> and the kingdom of Edom settled in southern [[Jordan]] and southern [[Israel]], and their capital was in [[Bozrah]] in [[Tafilah Governorate]]. The kingdom of [[Ammon]] maintained its independence from the [[Assyria]]n empire, unlike all other kingdoms in the region which were conquered.<ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan]</ref>\n\nIn about 840 BC, Meshe, the King of the [[Moabites]], revolted against the \"House of David.\" Moab lay east of the [[Dead Sea]], about 70 kilometers south of [[Amman]]. This battle is recorded in the Bible's [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] chapter 3. The Bible's story is corroborated by the [[Mesha Stele]], the Moabite Stone that was found in the [[Jordan]]ian town of [[Dhiban]] in 1868. This find indicated that the Moabites worked with inscriptions on bluish basalt stone.\n\n==Classical period==\n[[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|right|210px|[[Petra]], the capital of the [[Nabatean kingdom]], is where the Nabatean alphabet was developed, from which the current [[Arabic alphabet]] further evolved.{{cn|date=December 2019}}]]\n\nLater antiquity saw the rise of the [[Nabatean kingdom]] ({{Lang-ar| \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0637}} ''Al-Anbat''){{cn|date=December 2019}} with its capital at [[Petra]], which in time became a border, client state of the [[Roman Empire]] that got absorbed into the Empire in 106 CE. The city of [[Salt, Jordan|Saltus]] was probably established by [[Alexander the Great]]. During the Greco-Roman period of influence, a number of semi-independent city-states also developed in the region, grouped by general [[Pompey]] into a city-league, the [[Decapolis]], including on the territory of modern-day Jordan the cities of [[Gerasa]] ([[Jerash]]), Philadelphia ([[Amman]]), [[Abila (Decapolis)|Abila]] (probably identical with ancient [[Raphana]]; today's Quweilbeh), [[Dion, Palestine|Dion]] and [[Capitolias]] (Beit Ras; possibly the same as ancient Dion, with various identification attempts), [[Gadara]] (Umm Qays), and [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] (Tabaqat Fahl, west of [[Irbid]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Middle Ages==\nIn the early 7th century, the area of modern [[Jordan]] became integrated into the new Arab-Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Empire]] (the first Muslim dynasty), which ruled much of the Middle East from 661 until 750 CE. At the time, [[Amman]], today the capital of the Kingdom of [[Jordan]], became a major town in \"Jund Dimashq\" (the military district of Damascus) and became the seat of the provincial governor. In fact, the name \"Al-Urdun\" ([[Jordan]]) was used on Umayyad post-reform copper coins beginning in the early 8th century and represent the earliest official usage of the name for the modern state. Additionally, lead seals with the Arabic phrase \"Halahil Ardth Al-Urdun\" (Master of the Land of [[Jordan]]), dating from the late 7th to early 8th century CE, have been found in [[Jordan]] as well. Additionally, Arab-Byzantine \"Standing Caliph\" coins minted under the Umayyads also have been found bearing the mint-mark of \"Amman.\" Thus, usage of the names Al-Urdun/Jordan and Amman date back, to at least, the early decades of the Arab-Muslim takeover of the region\n\n[[File:Al Urdun Coin.jpg|right|thumb|Umayyad post-reform fals, c. 8th century]]\nUnder the Umayyad's successors, the Abbasids (750\u20131258), [[Jordan]] was neglected and began to languish due to the geo-political shift that occurred when the Abassids moved their capital from Damascus to Kufa and later to Baghdad.\n\nAfter the decline of the Abbasids, parts of [[Jordan]] were ruled by various powers and empires including the Crusaders, the Ayyubids, the Mamlukes as well as the Ottomans, who captured major parts of the Arab World around 1517.\n\n{{anchor|Modern history}}\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{main article|Ottoman Syria}}\n\nIn 1516, Ottoman forces invaded the Levant and [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|gained control]].<ref name=\"Cambridge 498\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0KYzOISv_4C&pg=PA498|page=498|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|title=The Cambridge history of Egypt|author=M.

Their decisions, most notably the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]], led to the establishment of the [[French Mandate for Syria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]]. The latter included the territory of Transjordan, which had been allocated to [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] approximately a year prior to the finalization of the Mandate document (the Mandate officially introduced in 1923).\n\nOne reason was that the British government had at that point to find a role for Abdullah, after his brother Faisal had lost his control in Syria.

Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with de jure recognition.\"<ref>Clea Lutz Bunch, \"Balancing Acts: Jordan and the United States during the Johnson Administration,\" Canadian Journal of History 41.3 (2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the U.S. State Department published a memorandum of conversation between Mr. Stuart W. Rockwell of the Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation, on 5 June 1950. Mr. Rifai asked when the United States was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Mr. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the United States to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the US accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Mr. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the US did in fact recognize the union.<ref>Foreign relations of the United States, 1950.

His son, Hussein Ibn Talal, became king on his eighteenth birthday, in 1953.\n\nThe 1950s have been labelled as a time of \"Jordan's Experiment with Liberalism\". Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association were guaranteed in the newly written constitution as with the already firmly established freedom of religion doctrine. Jordan had one of the freest and most liberal societies in the Middle East and in the greater Arab world during the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nJordan ended its special defense treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and British troops completed their withdrawal in 1957. In February 1958, following announcement of the merger of Syria and Egypt into the [[United Arab Republic]], Iraq and Jordan announced the [[Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan]], also known as the Arab Union. The Union was dissolved in August 1958.\n\n[[File:Jordan frontiers-en.svg|thumb|Image showing the approximate land exchanged in 1965 between Jordan (gaining green) and [[Saudi Arabia]] (gaining red).]]\nIn 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded a bilateral agreement that realigned the border. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan's coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about eighteen kilometers. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.\n[[File:Gov.archives.arc.652926.ogv|thumb|left|Video of developments regarding Jordan during 1980]]\n\nJordan signed a mutual defense pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated, along with Syria, Egypt, and Iraq in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967 against Israel. During the war, Israel took control of [[East Jerusalem]] and West Bank, leading to another major influx of Palestinian refugees into Jordan. Its [[Palestinian refugee]] population\u2014700,000 in 1966\u2014grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank.\n\nThe period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian militants (''fedayeen'') in Jordan. Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September 1970, known as the [[Black September in Jordan]], continuing ''fedayeen'' actions in Jordan \u2014 including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked and held in the desert east of Amman \u2014 prompted the Jordanian government to take action. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force took up positions in northern Jordan to support the ''fedayeen'' but was forced to retreat. By September 22, Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces won a decisive victory over the ''fedayeen'' in July 1971, expelling them from the country.\n\nAn attempted military coup was thwarted in 1972. No fighting occurred along the 1967 cease-fire line during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory.\n\nIn 1974, King Hussein recognised the [[PLO]] as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. However, in 1986, Hussein severed political links with the PLO and ordered its main offices to be closed. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement. Hussein also publicly backed the Palestinian uprising, or [[First Intifada]], against Israeli rule.\n\nJordan witnessed some of the most severe protests and social upheavals in its history during the 1980s, protests in Jordanian universities especially [[Yarmouk University]] and urban areas protested inflation and lack of political freedom. A massive upheaval occurred in the southern city of Ma'an. There was rioting in several cities over price increases in 1989. The same year saw the first general election since 1967. It was contested only by independent candidates because of the ban on political parties in 1963. Martial law was lifted and a period of rapid political liberalization began. Parliament was restored and some thirty political parties, including the Islamic Action Front, were created.\n\nJordan did not participate directly in the [[Gulf War]] of 1990\u20131991, but it broke with the Arab majority and supported the Iraqi position of [[Saddam Hussein]]. This position led to the temporary repeal of U.S. aid to Jordan. As a result, Jordan came under severe economic and diplomatic strain. After the Iraqi defeat in 1991, Jordan, along with [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] representatives, agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with [[Israel]] sponsored by the U.S. and [[Russia]]. Eventually, Jordan negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on July 25, 1994; the [[Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty]] was concluded on October 26, 1994, ending 46-year official state of war.\n\nFood price riots occurred in 1996, after subsidies were removed under an economic plan supervised by the International Monetary Fund. By the late 1990s, Jordan's unemployment rate was almost 25%, while nearly 50% of those who were employed were on the government payroll. The 1997 parliamentary elections were boycotted by several parties, associations and leading figures.\n\nIn 1998, King Hussein was treated for lymphatic cancer in the United States. After six months of treatment he returned home to a rousing welcome in January 1999. Soon after, however, he had to fly back to the US for further treatment. King Hussein died in February 1999. More than 50 heads of state attended his funeral. His eldest son Crown Prince Abdullah succeeded to the throne.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14636713 | title=Jordan profile| work=BBC News| date=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n\n===Reign of King Abdullah II===\n{{Jordan Series}}\n\n====Economy====\n[[Economic liberalization]] policies under [[King Abdullah II]] have helped to create one of the [[Index of Economic Freedom|freest economies]] in the [[Middle East]].\n\nIn March 2001, King Abdullah and presidents Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt inaugurated a $300m (\u00a3207m) electricity line linking the grids of the three countries. In September 2002, Jordan and Israel agreed on a plan to pipe water from the Red Sea to the shrinking Dead Sea. The project, costing $800m, is the two nations' biggest joint venture to date. King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the Wahdah Dam project at a ceremony on the [[Yarmuk River]] in February 2004.\n\n====Foreign relations====\nJordan has sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbors. In September 2000, a military court sentenced six men to death for plotting attacks against Israeli and US targets. Following the outbreak of [[Second Intifada|Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000]], Amman withdrew its ambassador to Israel for four years. In 2003, Jordan's Central Bank retracted an earlier decision to freeze accounts belonging to leaders of [[Hamas]]. When senior US diplomat [[Laurence Foley]] was gunned down outside his home in Amman in October 2002, in the first assassination of a Western diplomat in Jordan, scores of political activists were rounded up. Eight militants were later found guilty and executed in 2004. King Abdullah did, however, criticise the United States and Israel over the conflict in Lebanon in 2006.\n\n====Politics====\nJordan's gradual institution of political and [[civil liberty]] has continued, but the slow pace of reform has led to increasing discontent. Following the death of a youth in custody, riots erupted in the southern town of Maan in January 2002, the worst public disturbances in more than three years.\n\nThe first parliamentary elections under King Abdullah II were held in June 2003. Independent candidates loyal to the king won two-thirds of the seats. A new cabinet was appointed in October 2003 following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Ali Abu al-Ragheb]]. [[Faisal al-Fayez]] was appointed prime minister. The king also appointed three female ministers. However, in April 2005, amid reports of the king's dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reforms, the government resigned and a new cabinet was sworn in, led by Prime Minister [[Adnan Badran]].\n\nThe first local elections since 1999 were held in July 2007. The main opposition party, the Islamist Action Front, withdrew after accusing the government of vote-rigging. The parliamentary elections of November 2007 strengthened the position of tribal leaders and other pro-government candidates. Support for the opposition Islamic Action Front declined. Political moderate [[Nader Dahabi]] was appointed prime minister.\n\nIn November 2009, the King once more dissolved parliament halfway through its four-year term. The following month, he appointed a new premier to push through economic reform. A new electoral law was introduced May 2010, but pro-reform campaigners said it did little to make the system more representational. The parliamentary elections of November 2010 were boycotted by the opposition Islamic Action Front. Riots broke out after it was announced that pro-government candidates had won a sweeping victory.\n\n====Arab Spring====\nOn 14 January, the [[Jordanian protests (2011\u2013present)|Jordanian protests]] began in Jordan's capital [[Amman]], and at [[Ma'an]], [[Al Karak]], [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] and [[Irbid]], and other cities. The following month, King Abdullah appointed a new prime minister, former army general [[Marouf Bakhit]], and charged him with quelling the protests whilst carrying out political reforms. The street protests continued through the summer, albeit on a smaller scale, prompting the King to replace Bakhit with [[Awn al-Khasawneh]], a judge at the International Court of Justice (October 2011). However, Prime Minister Awn al-Khasawneh resigned abruptly after just six months having been unable to satisfy either the demands for reform or allay establishment fears of empowering the Islamist opposition. King Abdullah appointed former prime minister Fayez al-Tarawneh to succeed him.\n\nIn October 2012, King Abdullah called for early parliamentary elections, to be held at some time in 2013. The Islamic Action Front, continued in its calls for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. The King appointed [[Abdullah Ensour]], a former minister and vocal advocate of democratic reform, as prime minister.\n\nMass demonstrations took place in Amman (November 2012) against the lifting of fuel subsidies. Public calls for the end of the monarchy were heard. Clashes between protesters and supporters of the king followed. The government reversed the fuel price rise following the protest.<ref name=\"aljaz_totyrants\">{{Cite news |first=Lamis |last=Andoni |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world&nbsp;... |date=2011-01-16 |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117231003/http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' stated that protests are expected to continue for several weeks because of increasing food prices.<ref name=\"aljaz_totyrants\"/>\n\n====Arab Winter====\n{{main article|June 2014 Northern Iraq offensive}}\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] into northern and eastern Iraq in summer of 2014, Jordan became threatened by the radical Jihadist organization, boosting troops on the Iraqi and Syrian borders.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[History of Asia]]\n* [[History of the Middle East]]\n* [[History of the Levant]]\n* [[Jordan]]\n* [[List of kings of Jordan]]\n* [[Politics of Jordan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Al Sarhan, Atallah. \"United States' Foreign Policy toward the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan: 1990-2014.\" (2016).

The area was settled by nomadic tribes in the Bronze Age, which consolidated in small kingdoms during the Iron Age \u2013 such as the [[Edomites]] and [[Ammon]]ites, with partial areas controlled by the [[Israelites]]. In the classic period, Transjordan came under Greek and later Roman influence. Under the Romans and the Byzantines, Transjordan was home to the [[Decapolis]] in the North, with much of the region being designated as [[Byzantine Arabia]]. Classical kingdoms located in the region of Transjordan, such as the Roman-era [[Nabatean kingdom]], which had its capital in [[Petra]], left particularly dramatic ruins popular today with tourists and filmmakers. The history of Transjordan continued with the [[Caliphate|Muslim empires]] starting in the 7th century, partial crusader control in the mid-Middle Ages (country of [[Oultrejordain]]) and finally, [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)]] since 13th century and the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 16th century until World War I.\n\nWith the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] in 1916 and the consequent British invasion, the area came under the Anglo-Arab ruled [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] East in 1917, which was declared as the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920. Following the French occupation of only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom, [[Interregnum (Transjordan)|Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum]]. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, [[Abdullah's entry into Transjordan|arrived into Transjordan]]. With the [[Transjordan memorandum|British mandate of Transjordan]] in early 1920s, it became the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] under the Hashemite Emir. In 1946, independent [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan]] was formed and shortly admitted to the [[United Nations]] and the [[Arab League]]. In 1948, Jordan fought with the newly born state of Israel over lands of former [[Mandatory Palestine]], effectively gaining control of the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexing]] it with its Palestinian population. Jordan lost West Bank in the 1967 War with Israel, and since became the central base of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) in its struggle against Israel. The alliance between the PLO and the Jordanians, active during the [[War of Attrition]], came to an end in the bloody [[Black September in Jordan]] in 1970, when a civil war between Jordanians and Palestinians (with Syrian Ba'athist support) took thousands of lives. In the aftermath, the defeated PLO was forced out of Jordan together with tens of thousands of its fighters and their Palestinian families, relocating to South Lebanon.\n\n==Ancient history==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nEvidence of human activity in [[Jordan]] dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period. While there is no architectural evidence from this era, archaeologists have found tools, such as flint and basalt hand-axes, knives and scraping implements.\n[[File:Ruins of a Roman temple in Erak al Amir, Jordan.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An old Roman Temple in [[Iraq al-Amir]]]]\nIn the [[Neolithic]] period (8500\u20134500 BC) three major shifts occurred. First, people became [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], living in small villages, and discovering and domesticating new food sources such as cereal grains, peas and lentils, as well as goats. The human population increased to tens of thousands.\n\nSecond, this shift in settlement patterns appears to have been catalyzed by a marked change in climate. The eastern desert, in particular, grew warmer and drier, eventually to the point where it became uninhabitable for most of the year. This watershed climate change is believed to have occurred between 6500 and 5500 BC.\n\nThird, beginning sometime between 5500 and 4500 BC, the inhabitants began to make [[pottery]] from clay rather than plaster. Pottery-making technologies were probably introduced to the area by craftsmen from Mesopotamia.\n\nThe largest Neolithic site in Jordan is at [[Ein Ghazal]] in [[Amman]]. The many buildings were divided into three distinct districts. Houses were rectangular and had several rooms, some with plastered floors. Archaeologists have unearthed [[Plastered human skulls|skulls covered with plaster]] and with bitumen in the eye sockets at sites throughout [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Territories]] and [[Syria]]. A statue discovered at Ein Ghazal is thought to be 8,000 years old. Just over one meter high, it depicts a woman with huge eyes, skinny arms, knobby knees and a detailed rendering of her toes.\n\n{{History of the Levant}}\nDuring the Chalcolithic period (4500\u20133200 BC), copper began to be smelted and used to make axes, arrowheads and hooks. The cultivation of barley, dates, olives and lentils, and the domestication of sheep and goats, rather than hunting, predominated. The lifestyle in the desert was probably very similar to that of modern [[Bedouins]].\n\n[[Teleilat el Ghassul|Tuleitat Ghassul]] is a large Chalcolithic era village located in the [[Jordan|Jordan Valley]]. The walls of its houses were made of sun-dried mud bricks; its roofs of wood, reeds and mud. Some had stone foundations, and many had large central courtyards. The walls are often painted with bright images of masked men, stars, and geometric motifs, which may have been connected to religious beliefs.<ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_ancient.html Jordan \u2013 History \u2013 Ancient Jordan]</ref>\n\nMany of the villages built during the Early Bronze Age (3200\u20131950 BC) included simple water infrastructures, as well as defensive fortifications probably designed to protect against raids by neighboring nomadic tribes.\n\nAt [[Bab al-Dhra]] in [[Wadi `Araba]], archaeologists discovered more than 20,000 shaft tombs with multiple chambers as well as houses of mud-brick containing human bones, pots, jewelry and weapons. Hundreds of [[dolmens]] scattered throughout the mountains have been dated to the late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages.<ref>Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan; an introduction and field guide''. Amman, Jordan: The American Center of Oriental Research. {{ISBN|978-9957-8543-3-1}}</ref>\n\nAlthough writing was developed before 3000 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was generally not used in [[Jordan]], Canaan and Syria until some thousand years later, even though archeological evidence indicates that the [[Jordan]]ians were trading with Egypt and Mesopotamia.\n\nBetween 2300 and 1950 BC, many of the large, fortified hilltop towns were abandoned in favor of either small, unfortified villages or a pastoral lifestyle. There is no consensus on what caused this shift, though it is thought to have been a combination of climatic and political changes that brought an end to the city-state network.\n\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age (1950\u20131550 BC), migration across the Middle East increased. Trading continued to develop between Egypt, Syria, Arabia, Canaan and [[Jordan]], resulting in the spread of technology and other hallmarks of civilization. Bronze, forged from copper and tin, enabled the production of more durable axes, knives, and other tools and weapons. Large, distinct communities seem to have arisen in northern and central [[Jordan]], while the south was populated by a nomadic, Bedouin-type of people known as the [[Shasu]].\n\nNew fortifications appeared at sites like Amman's Citadel, [[Irbid]], and [[Tabaqat Fahl]] (or Pella). Towns were surrounded by ramparts made of earth embankments, and the slopes were covered in hard plaster, making the climb slippery and difficult. Pella was enclosed by massive walls and watch towers.\n\nArchaeologists usually date the end of the Middle Bronze Age to about 1550 BC, when the [[Hyksos]] were driven out of Egypt during the 17th and 18th Dynasties. A number of Middle Bronze Age towns in Canaan and [[Jordan]] were destroyed during this time.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe most prominent Iron Age kingdoms in [[Jordan]] were [[Ammon]], [[Moab]], and [[Edom]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sm7BOubDYcC&pg=PA1&lpg=PP1&output=html B. Mcdonald, Younker Ancient Ammon]</ref> The [[Ammon]]ites had their capital in [[Amman|Rabbath Ammon]]. The [[Moab]]ites settled [[Kerak Governorate]] with their capital at Kir of Moab ([[Kerak]]),<ref>[http://www.studylight.org/dic/sbd/view.cgi?number=T2596 Smith's Bible Dictionary]</ref> and the kingdom of Edom settled in southern [[Jordan]] and southern [[Israel]], and their capital was in [[Bozrah]] in [[Tafilah Governorate]]. The kingdom of [[Ammon]] maintained its independence from the [[Assyria]]n empire, unlike all other kingdoms in the region which were conquered.<ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan]</ref>\n\nIn about 840 BC, Meshe, the King of the [[Moabites]], revolted against the \"House of David.\" Moab lay east of the [[Dead Sea]], about 70 kilometers south of [[Amman]]. This battle is recorded in the Bible's [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] chapter 3. The Bible's story is corroborated by the [[Mesha Stele]], the Moabite Stone that was found in the [[Jordan]]ian town of [[Dhiban]] in 1868.

At the time, [[Amman]], today the capital of the Kingdom of [[Jordan]], became a major town in \"Jund Dimashq\" (the military district of Damascus) and became the seat of the provincial governor. In fact, the name \"Al-Urdun\" ([[Jordan]]) was used on Umayyad post-reform copper coins beginning in the early 8th century and represent the earliest official usage of the name for the modern state. Additionally, lead seals with the Arabic phrase \"Halahil Ardth Al-Urdun\" (Master of the Land of [[Jordan]]), dating from the late 7th to early 8th century CE, have been found in [[Jordan]] as well. Additionally, Arab-Byzantine \"Standing Caliph\" coins minted under the Umayyads also have been found bearing the mint-mark of \"Amman.\" Thus, usage of the names Al-Urdun/Jordan and Amman date back, to at least, the early decades of the Arab-Muslim takeover of the region\n\n[[File:Al Urdun Coin.jpg|right|thumb|Umayyad post-reform fals, c. 8th century]]\nUnder the Umayyad's successors, the Abbasids (750\u20131258), [[Jordan]] was neglected and began to languish due to the geo-political shift that occurred when the Abassids moved their capital from Damascus to Kufa and later to Baghdad.\n\nAfter the decline of the Abbasids, parts of [[Jordan]] were ruled by various powers and empires including the Crusaders, the Ayyubids, the Mamlukes as well as the Ottomans, who captured major parts of the Arab World around 1517.\n\n{{anchor|Modern history}}\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{main article|Ottoman Syria}}\n\nIn 1516, Ottoman forces invaded the Levant and [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|gained control]].<ref name=\"Cambridge 498\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0KYzOISv_4C&pg=PA498|page=498|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|title=The Cambridge history of Egypt|author=M.

The latter included the territory of Transjordan, which had been allocated to [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] approximately a year prior to the finalization of the Mandate document (the Mandate officially introduced in 1923).\n\nOne reason was that the British government had at that point to find a role for Abdullah, after his brother Faisal had lost his control in Syria.

Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association were guaranteed in the newly written constitution as with the already firmly established freedom of religion doctrine.

In February 1958, following announcement of the merger of Syria and Egypt into the [[United Arab Republic]], Iraq and Jordan announced the [[Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan]], also known as the Arab Union. The Union was dissolved in August 1958.\n\n[[File:Jordan frontiers-en.svg|thumb|Image showing the approximate land exchanged in 1965 between Jordan (gaining green) and [[Saudi Arabia]] (gaining red).]]\nIn 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded a bilateral agreement that realigned the border. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan's coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about eighteen kilometers. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.\n[[File:Gov.archives.arc.652926.ogv|thumb|left|Video of developments regarding Jordan during 1980]]\n\nJordan signed a mutual defense pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated, along with Syria, Egypt, and Iraq in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967 against Israel. During the war, Israel took control of [[East Jerusalem]] and West Bank, leading to another major influx of Palestinian refugees into Jordan. Its [[Palestinian refugee]] population\u2014700,000 in 1966\u2014grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank.\n\nThe period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian militants (''fedayeen'') in Jordan. Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September 1970, known as the [[Black September in Jordan]], continuing ''fedayeen'' actions in Jordan \u2014 including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked and held in the desert east of Amman \u2014 prompted the Jordanian government to take action. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force took up positions in northern Jordan to support the ''fedayeen'' but was forced to retreat. By September 22, Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces won a decisive victory over the ''fedayeen'' in July 1971, expelling them from the country.\n\nAn attempted military coup was thwarted in 1972. No fighting occurred along the 1967 cease-fire line during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory.\n\nIn 1974, King Hussein recognised the [[PLO]] as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. However, in 1986, Hussein severed political links with the PLO and ordered its main offices to be closed. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement. Hussein also publicly backed the Palestinian uprising, or [[First Intifada]], against Israeli rule.\n\nJordan witnessed some of the most severe protests and social upheavals in its history during the 1980s, protests in Jordanian universities especially [[Yarmouk University]] and urban areas protested inflation and lack of political freedom. A massive upheaval occurred in the southern city of Ma'an. There was rioting in several cities over price increases in 1989. The same year saw the first general election since 1967. It was contested only by independent candidates because of the ban on political parties in 1963. Martial law was lifted and a period of rapid political liberalization began. Parliament was restored and some thirty political parties, including the Islamic Action Front, were created.\n\nJordan did not participate directly in the [[Gulf War]] of 1990\u20131991, but it broke with the Arab majority and supported the Iraqi position of [[Saddam Hussein]]. This position led to the temporary repeal of U.S. aid to Jordan. As a result, Jordan came under severe economic and diplomatic strain. After the Iraqi defeat in 1991, Jordan, along with [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] representatives, agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with [[Israel]] sponsored by the U.S. and [[Russia]]. Eventually, Jordan negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on July 25, 1994; the [[Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty]] was concluded on October 26, 1994, ending 46-year official state of war.\n\nFood price riots occurred in 1996, after subsidies were removed under an economic plan supervised by the International Monetary Fund. By the late 1990s, Jordan's unemployment rate was almost 25%, while nearly 50% of those who were employed were on the government payroll. The 1997 parliamentary elections were boycotted by several parties, associations and leading figures.\n\nIn 1998, King Hussein was treated for lymphatic cancer in the United States. After six months of treatment he returned home to a rousing welcome in January 1999. Soon after, however, he had to fly back to the US for further treatment. King Hussein died in February 1999. More than 50 heads of state attended his funeral. His eldest son Crown Prince Abdullah succeeded to the throne.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14636713 | title=Jordan profile| work=BBC News| date=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n\n===Reign of King Abdullah II===\n{{Jordan Series}}\n\n====Economy====\n[[Economic liberalization]] policies under [[King Abdullah II]] have helped to create one of the [[Index of Economic Freedom|freest economies]] in the [[Middle East]].\n\nIn March 2001, King Abdullah and presidents Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt inaugurated a $300m (\u00a3207m) electricity line linking the grids of the three countries. In September 2002, Jordan and Israel agreed on a plan to pipe water from the Red Sea to the shrinking Dead Sea. The project, costing $800m, is the two nations' biggest joint venture to date. King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the Wahdah Dam project at a ceremony on the [[Yarmuk River]] in February 2004.\n\n====Foreign relations====\nJordan has sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbors. In September 2000, a military court sentenced six men to death for plotting attacks against Israeli and US targets. Following the outbreak of [[Second Intifada|Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000]], Amman withdrew its ambassador to Israel for four years. In 2003, Jordan's Central Bank retracted an earlier decision to freeze accounts belonging to leaders of [[Hamas]]. When senior US diplomat [[Laurence Foley]] was gunned down outside his home in Amman in October 2002, in the first assassination of a Western diplomat in Jordan, scores of political activists were rounded up. Eight militants were later found guilty and executed in 2004. King Abdullah did, however, criticise the United States and Israel over the conflict in Lebanon in 2006.\n\n====Politics====\nJordan's gradual institution of political and [[civil liberty]] has continued, but the slow pace of reform has led to increasing discontent. Following the death of a youth in custody, riots erupted in the southern town of Maan in January 2002, the worst public disturbances in more than three years.\n\nThe first parliamentary elections under King Abdullah II were held in June 2003. Independent candidates loyal to the king won two-thirds of the seats. A new cabinet was appointed in October 2003 following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Ali Abu al-Ragheb]]. [[Faisal al-Fayez]] was appointed prime minister. The king also appointed three female ministers. However, in April 2005, amid reports of the king's dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reforms, the government resigned and a new cabinet was sworn in, led by Prime Minister [[Adnan Badran]].\n\nThe first local elections since 1999 were held in July 2007. The main opposition party, the Islamist Action Front, withdrew after accusing the government of vote-rigging. The parliamentary elections of November 2007 strengthened the position of tribal leaders and other pro-government candidates. Support for the opposition Islamic Action Front declined. Political moderate [[Nader Dahabi]] was appointed prime minister.\n\nIn November 2009, the King once more dissolved parliament halfway through its four-year term. The following month, he appointed a new premier to push through economic reform. A new electoral law was introduced May 2010, but pro-reform campaigners said it did little to make the system more representational. The parliamentary elections of November 2010 were boycotted by the opposition Islamic Action Front. Riots broke out after it was announced that pro-government candidates had won a sweeping victory.\n\n====Arab Spring====\nOn 14 January, the [[Jordanian protests (2011\u2013present)|Jordanian protests]] began in Jordan's capital [[Amman]], and at [[Ma'an]], [[Al Karak]], [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] and [[Irbid]], and other cities. The following month, King Abdullah appointed a new prime minister, former army general [[Marouf Bakhit]], and charged him with quelling the protests whilst carrying out political reforms. The street protests continued through the summer, albeit on a smaller scale, prompting the King to replace Bakhit with [[Awn al-Khasawneh]], a judge at the International Court of Justice (October 2011). However, Prime Minister Awn al-Khasawneh resigned abruptly after just six months having been unable to satisfy either the demands for reform or allay establishment fears of empowering the Islamist opposition. King Abdullah appointed former prime minister Fayez al-Tarawneh to succeed him.\n\nIn October 2012, King Abdullah called for early parliamentary elections, to be held at some time in 2013. The Islamic Action Front, continued in its calls for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. The King appointed [[Abdullah Ensour]], a former minister and vocal advocate of democratic reform, as prime minister.\n\nMass demonstrations took place in Amman (November 2012) against the lifting of fuel subsidies. Public calls for the end of the monarchy were heard. Clashes between protesters and supporters of the king followed. The government reversed the fuel price rise following the protest.<ref name=\"aljaz_totyrants\">{{Cite news |first=Lamis |last=Andoni |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world&nbsp;... |date=2011-01-16 |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117231003/http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' stated that protests are expected to continue for several weeks because of increasing food prices.<ref name=\"aljaz_totyrants\"/>\n\n====Arab Winter====\n{{main article|June 2014 Northern Iraq offensive}}\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] into northern and eastern Iraq in summer of 2014, Jordan became threatened by the radical Jihadist organization, boosting troops on the Iraqi and Syrian borders.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[History of Asia]]\n* [[History of the Middle East]]\n* [[History of the Levant]]\n* [[Jordan]]\n* [[List of kings of Jordan]]\n* [[Politics of Jordan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Al Sarhan, Atallah. \"United States' Foreign Policy toward the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan: 1990-2014.\" (2016).
