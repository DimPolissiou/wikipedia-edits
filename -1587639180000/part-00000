While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], \"espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish) derives from the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word ''espaignol'' and that, in turn, derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''Hispaniolus'', which means \"from \u2014or pertaining to\u2014 [[Hispania]]\". The Latin form {{smallcaps|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cOLUS</small>}} comes from the Latin name of the province of [[Hispania|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cA</small>]] that included the current territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In late Latin, the /<small>H</small>/ was silent and /<small>\u012c</small>/ evolved into a short /e/, resulting in the word <small>ESPA\u0147OL(U)</small>.\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Some [[Philology|philologists]] argue that \"espa\u00f1ol\" comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''espaignon''. On the other hand, Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal|Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] suggested that the classic ''hispanus'' or ''hispanicus'' took the suffix ''-one'' from [[Vulgar Latin]], as it happened with other words such as ''bret\u00f3n'' (Breton) or ''saj\u00f3n'' (Saxon). The term ''hispanione'' evolved into the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''espa\u00f1\u00f3n'', which eventually, became ''espa\u00f1ol''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}\n\n[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402124945/http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])\u2014some related to Latin via Indo-European, and some that are not related at all\u2014were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]\u2014[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\nAccording to the theories of [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.<ref name=Penny1>{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20\u201321}}</ref> In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}</ref> The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.<ref name=Penny1 />\n\nThe development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|v\u012bta}}}} > Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}).

The {{lang|es|h-}}, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects it is still aspirated in some words.

For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Spanish grammar}}\n[[File:Cervantes J\u00e1uregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]\n\nMost of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]. In addition, articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)\n\nSpanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.\n\nThe language is classified as a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a \"[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]\", or \"[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]\" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nSubject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]\n{{Main|Spanish phonology}}\n\nThe Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects\u2014especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]\u2014as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}</ref> The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[\u028e]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u028e]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[\u0292]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[\u028e]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).\n\n=== Segmental phonology ===\n[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]\nThe Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}</ref>). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides\u2014{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s\u2014{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\u2014which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"[[Flap consonant|tapped]]\" and \"[[Trill consonant|trilled]]\" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/\u028e/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u029d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|p=255}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}</ref>\n* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.\n* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capit\u00e1n}}, {{lang|es|almac\u00e9n}}, {{lang|es|jard\u00edn}}, {{lang|es|coraz\u00f3n}}).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guard\u00e1ndoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|s\u00e1bana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|l\u00edmite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limit\u00e9}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|l\u00edquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquid\u00f3}} ('he/she sold off').\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable.

The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years. \nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines, which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish. \n\n====Chavacano====\n{{main article|Chavacano}}\nChavacano or Chabacano [t\u0283a\u03b2a\u02c8kano] is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines.

the main dialects of Spanish.]]\n{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}\nThere are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\nThe variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.<ref>Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154\u2013155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&pg=PA154&dq=Mexican+vowels&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Mexican%20vowels&f=false URL]</ref><ref>Lope Blanch, Juan M.

Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[ye\u00edsmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.<ref>{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831041048/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}</ref> However, the variety used in the media is that of Madrid's educated classes, where southern traits are less evident, in contrast with the variety spoken by working-class Madrid, where those traits are pervasive. The educated variety of Madrid is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}]] (\"theta\"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/\u028e/}}]] (\"turned ''y''\"),<ref>The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol \"turned ''y''\" (\u028e), with its \"tail\" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), whose tail leans to the left.</ref>\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinci\u00f3n]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiraci\u00f3n}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} (also described acoustically as \"[[Grave and acute|grave]]\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} (\"curly-tail ''j''\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zhe\u00edsmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|she\u00edsmo}}).<ref>Charles B.

The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.<ref name=\"rae.es site\">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos dec\u00eds}}, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}: {{lang|es|Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan}} (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\nThe verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pens\u00e1'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos pens\u00e1s}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volv\u00e9'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos volv\u00e9s}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|pens\u00e1!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|volv\u00e9!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General voseo <small>([[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]])</small>\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indicative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Subjunctive\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imperative\n|-\n!

Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.<ref>Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto L\u00f3pez Morales, ''Estudios sobre el espa\u00f1ol de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Am\u00e9ricas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138\u2013146.</ref>\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.\n\nAreas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].<ref name=\"rae.es site\" />\n\n==== Ustedes ====\n{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.\n\n==== Usted ====\n{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n==== Third-person object pronouns ====\nMost speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"{{lang|es|[[le\u00edsmo]]}}\", \"{{lang|es|[[lo\u00edsmo]]}}\", or \"{{lang|es|[[la\u00edsmo]]}}\", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.\n\n== Relation to other languages ==\n{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}\nSpanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}</ref><ref name=\"ezglot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}</ref> And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.<ref name=\"Ladino\" /> Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.\n\nA related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Spanish orthography}}\n{{Spanish language}}\nSpanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} ({{lang|es|e\u00f1e}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|\u0272]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|\u028e]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhisp\u00e1nico de Dudas], 1st ed.</ref><ref>[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{in lang|es|en}}</ref>\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n:{{lang|es|A, B, C,<!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --> D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,<!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --> M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R, <!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --> S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}\n\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario|title=Exclusi\u00f3n de ch y ll del abecedario &#124; Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|website=www.rae.es}}</ref>\n\nThe letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[M\u00e9xico]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|\u00e9l}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|t\u00e9}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|d\u00e9}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|s\u00e9}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\nThe interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qu\u00e9}}, {{lang|es|cu\u00e1l}}, {{lang|es|d\u00f3nde}}, {{lang|es|qui\u00e9n}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|\u00e9se}}, {{lang|es|\u00e9ste}}, {{lang|es|aqu\u00e9l}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\nWhen {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a \"[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]\" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|\u00fc}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cig\u00fce\u00f1a}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigue\u00f1a}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]}}).\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|\u00bf}} and {{lang|es|\u00a1}}, respectively).\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Academia de la Lengua.jpg|thumb|The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] Headquarters in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n\n=== Royal Spanish Academy ===\n{{main|Royal Spanish Academy}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.27|Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\nThe Royal Spanish Academy ({{lang-es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}}), founded in 1713,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234545/http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> together with the 21 other national ones (see [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language ([[Standard Spanish]]) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===\n{{main|Association of Spanish Language Academies}}\n[[File:Pa\u00edses con academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|Countries members of the ASALE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |title=Association of Spanish Language Academies |language=Spanish |publisher=Asale |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923155313/http://asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies ({{lang|es|Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola}}, or {{lang|es|ASALE}}) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

headquarters, [[Madrid]]]]\nThe {{lang|es|Instituto Cervantes}} (Cervantes Institute) is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 75 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"[https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2018/noticias/np_presentacion-anuario.htm El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018]\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.<ref>Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain \u2013 only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Official use by international organizations ===\n{{Main|List of countries where Spanish is an official language#International organizations where Spanish is official}}\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]], the [[Latin Union]], the [[Caricom]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and numerous other international organizations.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{col-start-fixed|width=calc(100% \u2013 256px)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Spanish-language poets]]\n* [[Fund\u00e9u BBVA]]\n* [[Spanish as a second or foreign language]]\n\n; Spanish words and phrases\n* [[Longest word in Spanish]]\n* [[Most common words in Spanish]]\n* [[Spanish profanity]]\n* [[Spanish proverbs]]\n* [[List of English\u2013Spanish interlingual homographs]]\n* [[Cuento]]\n\n; [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking world]]\n* [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Countries where Spanish is an official language]]\n* [[Hispanic culture]]\n* [[Hispanicization]]\n* [[Hispanidad]]\n* [[Hispanism]]\n* [[Hispanosphere]]\n* [[Panhispanism]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Influences on the Spanish language]]\n* [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Nahuatl origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Indigenous American Indian origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Philippine origin]]\n; [[Spanish-based creole languages|Dialects and languages influenced by Spanish]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 language|Cal\u00f3]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[Frespa\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]\n* [[Llanito]]\n* [[Palenquero]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Philippine languages]]\n* [[Portu\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Spanglish]]\n* [[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Spanish origin]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* '''European Spanish'''\n** [[Peninsular Spanish]]\n*** [[Andalusian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castilian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castrapo]] (Galician Spanish)\n*** [[Cast\u00fao]] (Extremaduran Spanish)\n*** [[Murcian Spanish]]\n** Insular Spanish\n*** [[Canarian Spanish]]\n* '''[[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in the Americas]]'''\n** [[North American Spanish]]\n** [[Central American Spanish]]\n** [[Caribbean Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in South America|South American Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish in the United States]]\n* '''Spanish in Africa'''\n** [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]\n** [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]\n* '''Spanish in Asia'''\n** [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish in the Philippines]]<ref>A First Spanish Reader, by Erwin W.

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], \"espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish) derives from the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word ''espaignol'' and that, in turn, derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''Hispaniolus'', which means \"from \u2014or pertaining to\u2014 [[Hispania]]\". The Latin form {{smallcaps|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cOLUS</small>}} comes from the Latin name of the province of [[Hispania|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cA</small>]] that included the current territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In late Latin, the /<small>H</small>/ was silent and /<small>\u012c</small>/ evolved into a short /e/, resulting in the word <small>ESPA\u0147OL(U)</small>.\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Some [[Philology|philologists]] argue that \"espa\u00f1ol\" comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''espaignon''. On the other hand, Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal|Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] suggested that the classic ''hispanus'' or ''hispanicus'' took the suffix ''-one'' from [[Vulgar Latin]], as it happened with other words such as ''bret\u00f3n'' (Breton) or ''saj\u00f3n'' (Saxon). The term ''hispanione'' evolved into the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''espa\u00f1\u00f3n'', which eventually, became ''espa\u00f1ol''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}\n\n[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402124945/http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])\u2014some related to Latin via Indo-European, and some that are not related at all\u2014were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]\u2014[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\nAccording to the theories of [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.<ref name=Penny1>{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20\u201321}}</ref> In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}</ref> The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.<ref name=Penny1 />\n\nThe development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|v\u012bta}}}} > Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}).

Because of borrowings from Latin and from neighboring Romance languages, there are many {{lang|es|f}}-/{{lang|es|h}}-doublets in modern Spanish: {{lang|es|Fernando}} and {{lang|es|Hernando}} (both Spanish for \"Ferdinand\"), {{lang|es|ferrero}} and {{lang|es|herrero}} (both Spanish for \"smith\"), {{lang|es|fierro}} and {{lang|es|hierro}} (both Spanish for \"iron\"), and {{lang|es|fondo}} and {{lang|es|hondo}} (both Spanish for \"deep\", but {{lang|es|fondo}} means \"bottom\" while {{lang|es|hondo}} means \"deep\"); {{lang|es|hacer}} (Spanish for \"to make\") is cognate to the root word of {{lang|es|satisfacer}} (Spanish for \"to satisfy\"), and {{lang|es|hecho}} (\"made\") is similarly cognate to the root word of {{lang|es|satisfecho}} (Spanish for \"satisfied\").\n\nCompare the examples in the following table:\n<div style=\"overflow: auto;\">\n<!-- The words in each cell are tagged with the first language whose column intersects the cell. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Spanish grammar}}\n[[File:Cervantes J\u00e1uregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]\n\nMost of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]. In addition, articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)\n\nSpanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.\n\nThe language is classified as a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a \"[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]\", or \"[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]\" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nSubject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]\n{{Main|Spanish phonology}}\n\nThe Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects\u2014especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]\u2014as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}</ref> The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[\u028e]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u028e]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[\u0292]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[\u028e]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).\n\n=== Segmental phonology ===\n[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]\nThe Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}</ref>). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides\u2014{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s\u2014{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\u2014which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"[[Flap consonant|tapped]]\" and \"[[Trill consonant|trilled]]\" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/\u028e/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u029d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|p=255}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}</ref>\n* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.\n* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capit\u00e1n}}, {{lang|es|almac\u00e9n}}, {{lang|es|jard\u00edn}}, {{lang|es|coraz\u00f3n}}).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guard\u00e1ndoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|s\u00e1bana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|l\u00edmite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limit\u00e9}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|l\u00edquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquid\u00f3}} ('he/she sold off').\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable.

The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years. \nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines, which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish. \n\n====Chavacano====\n{{main article|Chavacano}}\nChavacano or Chabacano [t\u0283a\u03b2a\u02c8kano] is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines.

the main dialects of Spanish.]]\n{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}\nThere are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\nThe variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.<ref>Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154\u2013155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&pg=PA154&dq=Mexican+vowels&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Mexican%20vowels&f=false URL]</ref><ref>Lope Blanch, Juan M.

Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[ye\u00edsmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.<ref>{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831041048/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}</ref> However, the variety used in the media is that of Madrid's educated classes, where southern traits are less evident, in contrast with the variety spoken by working-class Madrid, where those traits are pervasive. The educated variety of Madrid is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}]] (\"theta\"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/\u028e/}}]] (\"turned ''y''\"),<ref>The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol \"turned ''y''\" (\u028e), with its \"tail\" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), whose tail leans to the left.</ref>\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinci\u00f3n]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiraci\u00f3n}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} (also described acoustically as \"[[Grave and acute|grave]]\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} (\"curly-tail ''j''\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zhe\u00edsmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|she\u00edsmo}}).<ref>Charles B.

The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.<ref name=\"rae.es site\">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos dec\u00eds}}, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}: {{lang|es|Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan}} (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\nThe verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pens\u00e1'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos pens\u00e1s}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volv\u00e9'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos volv\u00e9s}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|pens\u00e1!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|volv\u00e9!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General voseo <small>([[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]])</small>\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indicative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Subjunctive\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imperative\n|-\n!

Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.<ref>Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto L\u00f3pez Morales, ''Estudios sobre el espa\u00f1ol de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Am\u00e9ricas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138\u2013146.</ref>\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.\n\nAreas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].<ref name=\"rae.es site\" />\n\n==== Ustedes ====\n{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.\n\n==== Usted ====\n{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n==== Third-person object pronouns ====\nMost speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"{{lang|es|[[le\u00edsmo]]}}\", \"{{lang|es|[[lo\u00edsmo]]}}\", or \"{{lang|es|[[la\u00edsmo]]}}\", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.\n\n== Relation to other languages ==\n{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}\nSpanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}</ref><ref name=\"ezglot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}</ref> And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.<ref name=\"Ladino\" /> Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.\n\nA related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Spanish orthography}}\n{{Spanish language}}\nSpanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} ({{lang|es|e\u00f1e}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|\u0272]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|\u028e]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhisp\u00e1nico de Dudas], 1st ed.</ref><ref>[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{in lang|es|en}}</ref>\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n:{{lang|es|A, B, C,<!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --> D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,<!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --> M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R, <!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --> S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}\n\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario|title=Exclusi\u00f3n de ch y ll del abecedario &#124; Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|website=www.rae.es}}</ref>\n\nThe letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[M\u00e9xico]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|\u00e9l}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|t\u00e9}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|d\u00e9}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|s\u00e9}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\nThe interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qu\u00e9}}, {{lang|es|cu\u00e1l}}, {{lang|es|d\u00f3nde}}, {{lang|es|qui\u00e9n}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|\u00e9se}}, {{lang|es|\u00e9ste}}, {{lang|es|aqu\u00e9l}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\nWhen {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a \"[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]\" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|\u00fc}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cig\u00fce\u00f1a}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigue\u00f1a}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]}}).\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|\u00bf}} and {{lang|es|\u00a1}}, respectively).\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Academia de la Lengua.jpg|thumb|The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] Headquarters in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n\n=== Royal Spanish Academy ===\n{{main|Royal Spanish Academy}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.27|Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\nThe Royal Spanish Academy ({{lang-es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}}), founded in 1713,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234545/http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> together with the 21 other national ones (see [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language ([[Standard Spanish]]) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===\n{{main|Association of Spanish Language Academies}}\n[[File:Pa\u00edses con academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|Countries members of the ASALE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |title=Association of Spanish Language Academies |language=Spanish |publisher=Asale |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923155313/http://asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies ({{lang|es|Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola}}, or {{lang|es|ASALE}}) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 75 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"[https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2018/noticias/np_presentacion-anuario.htm El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018]\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.<ref>Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain \u2013 only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Official use by international organizations ===\n{{Main|List of countries where Spanish is an official language#International organizations where Spanish is official}}\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]], the [[Latin Union]], the [[Caricom]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and numerous other international organizations.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{col-start-fixed|width=calc(100% \u2013 256px)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Spanish-language poets]]\n* [[Fund\u00e9u BBVA]]\n* [[Spanish as a second or foreign language]]\n\n; Spanish words and phrases\n* [[Longest word in Spanish]]\n* [[Most common words in Spanish]]\n* [[Spanish profanity]]\n* [[Spanish proverbs]]\n* [[List of English\u2013Spanish interlingual homographs]]\n* [[Cuento]]\n\n; [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking world]]\n* [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Countries where Spanish is an official language]]\n* [[Hispanic culture]]\n* [[Hispanicization]]\n* [[Hispanidad]]\n* [[Hispanism]]\n* [[Hispanosphere]]\n* [[Panhispanism]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Influences on the Spanish language]]\n* [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Nahuatl origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Indigenous American Indian origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Philippine origin]]\n; [[Spanish-based creole languages|Dialects and languages influenced by Spanish]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 language|Cal\u00f3]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[Frespa\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]\n* [[Llanito]]\n* [[Palenquero]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Philippine languages]]\n* [[Portu\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Spanglish]]\n* [[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Spanish origin]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* '''European Spanish'''\n** [[Peninsular Spanish]]\n*** [[Andalusian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castilian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castrapo]] (Galician Spanish)\n*** [[Cast\u00fao]] (Extremaduran Spanish)\n*** [[Murcian Spanish]]\n** Insular Spanish\n*** [[Canarian Spanish]]\n* '''[[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in the Americas]]'''\n** [[North American Spanish]]\n** [[Central American Spanish]]\n** [[Caribbean Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in South America|South American Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish in the United States]]\n* '''Spanish in Africa'''\n** [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]\n** [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]\n* '''Spanish in Asia'''\n** [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish in the Philippines]]<ref>A First Spanish Reader, by Erwin W.

But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia.\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do so until her dying day.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}\n\nBy the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either\".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was \"the best singer in the business\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had \"perfected the art of intimacy.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Frank Sinatra Reader|last = White|first = John|year = 1996|journal = Journal of American Studies|access-date = }}</ref> According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a \"fairly rangy voice\",{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C. Sinatra could \"surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low E at 0:41 in the recording of \"[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]\" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that \"His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

If someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible.\"|source=\u2014Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}\nSinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a \"brooding melancholy\", such as \"[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]\", \"[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]\", \"[[My One and Only Love]]\" and \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists\". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art\".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}\n\n== Film career ==\n{{See also|Frank Sinatra filmography}}\n\n=== Debut, musical films, and career slump (1941\u20131952) ===\n\n[[File:Frank Sinatra in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\n\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s.

Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]\". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia.\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do so until her dying day.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}\n\nBy the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either\".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was \"the best singer in the business\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had \"perfected the art of intimacy.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Frank Sinatra Reader|last = White|first = John|year = 1996|journal = Journal of American Studies|access-date = }}</ref> According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a \"fairly rangy voice\",{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C. Sinatra could \"surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low E at 0:41 in the recording of \"[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]\" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that \"His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

If someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible.\"|source=\u2014Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}\nSinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a \"brooding melancholy\", such as \"[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]\", \"[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]\", \"[[My One and Only Love]]\" and \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists\". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art\".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}\n\n== Film career ==\n{{See also|Frank Sinatra filmography}}\n\n=== Debut, musical films, and career slump (1941\u20131952) ===\n\n[[File:Frank Sinatra in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\n\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s.

Despite the wild surrounding country, which was covered with woodlands, he laid the foundation of the present town. In 1628 Coote obtained for the inhabitants a grant of two weekly markets and two fairs, and established a very extensive [[linen]] and [[fustian]] manufactory. In the year 1641, as a Royalist supporter, much of his property was destroyed during the Irish Confederacy in the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]].{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nHis son Sam Coote regained the castle and estate of Mountrath, along with other properties and following [[the Restoration]], was created [[Earl of Mountrath]]. This title was extant until the death of Charles Henry, the 7th Earl, in 1802, when it became extinct. Newpark, adjoining the town, was the residence of the Earl of Mountrath. In 1831 the town contained 429 houses; iron was made and wrought here till the neighbouring woods were consumed for charcoal fuel. The Post Chaise Companion, published in 1805, states that:{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n:''\"Near Mountrath is an extensive bank containing, or rather, formed of excellent iron ore, within a few metres of the surface; here an iron and metal foundry has been established and wrought some years since with great success; but at present, from the scarcity of charcoal, on the destruction of the neighbouring woods, the furnaces are seldom employed; it is much to be regretted that such a valuable manufacture should be discontinued on the above account, as the country abounds with bogs, and charred turf might probably be substituted in the place of charcoal for most purposes.\"''\n\nIn his 1837 ''[[A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland|Topographical Dictionary of Ireland]]'' entry for Mountrath, Samuel Lewis states that:<ref>{{cite book |url = https://www.libraryireland.com/topog/M/Mount-Rath-Maryborough-West-Queens.php | via = libraryireland.com | author = Samuel Lewis | title = A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland | date = 1837 }}</ref>\n\n:''\"an extensive factory for spinning and weaving cotton is carried on by Mr. Greenham, who employs 150 persons in the spinning mills, and about 500 in weaving calicoes at their own houses; the average quantity manufactured is from 200 to 250 pieces weekly. Stuff-weaving is also carried on extensively; there is a large brewery and malting establishment, and an extensive oil mill; and the inhabitants carry on a very extensive country trade.\"''\n\nIn the latter portion of the eighteenth and early nineteenth twentieth century, the [[Orange Order]] was strong in the town of Mountrath and surrounding townships. Older leases granted on the Castlecoote estate, on which the town was built, were written in strict accordance with the Penal Laws,  and contained a clause prohibiting the letting, selling, or bestowal of ground for the purpose of erecting a [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In consequence of this prohibition, the place of worship used by local Catholics stood upon a sand-bank beside a tributary of the [[River Nore]] called 'The Brook\".{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1794, Dr. Delany, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin proposed to build a parish church. Lord Castlecoote was publicly opposed to the proposal but the political climate of toleration that followed the Relief Act of 1793 encouraged the bishop. He made application for a site to Mr. Hawkesworth, agent to Lord Castlecoote. This gentleman found Dr. Delany a suitable plot from his own landholdings and shortly after, through his influence with the proprietor, procured a perpetual peppercorn lease as a site for a parish church. Building commenced about 1795.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn 18 April 1809, the Convent of St. Brigid, at Mountrath, was founded by three sisters from the mother house at Tullow. Soon after, the Monastery of St. Patrick was established. Both convent and monastery communities were employed in the education of Roman Catholic pupils. A new church was completed in 1867.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn October 2017 the Bridgidine Sisters gifted the Convent to the community of Mountrath for the long term benefit and development of the town and surrounding areas. In 2018 a fitness and martial arts academy opened its doors to the public offering Karate, Jujitsu, Kickboxing and Fitness classes. In 2018, building work commenced on a new Enterprise Hub and Community Centre within the confines of the Convent buildings.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Places of interest==\nNear Mountrath on the R445 towards [[Portlaoise]] is a shapeless old Wish Tree in the form of a [[Sycamore Maple|Sycamore]] tree called ''St Fintan's Well''. The original well was filled in, but the water re-appeared in the centre of the tree. Hundreds of [[pennies]] have been beaten into the bark as good luck offerings, until they eventually had apparently killed the tree but it began to sprout new shoots from its trunk and is growing again.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\">Wilkinson, Gerald (1976).

This title was extant until the death of Charles Henry, the 7th Earl, in 1802, when it became extinct. Newpark, adjoining the town, was the residence of the Earl of Mountrath. In 1831 the town contained 429 houses; iron was made and wrought here till the neighbouring woods were consumed for charcoal fuel. The Post Chaise Companion, published in 1805, states that:{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n:''\"Near Mountrath is an extensive bank containing, or rather, formed of excellent iron ore, within a few metres of the surface; here an iron and metal foundry has been established and wrought some years since with great success; but at present, from the scarcity of charcoal, on the destruction of the neighbouring woods, the furnaces are seldom employed; it is much to be regretted that such a valuable manufacture should be discontinued on the above account, as the country abounds with bogs, and charred turf might probably be substituted in the place of charcoal for most purposes.\"''\n\nIn his 1837 ''[[A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland|Topographical Dictionary of Ireland]]'' entry for Mountrath, Samuel Lewis states that:<ref>{{cite book |url = https://www.libraryireland.com/topog/M/Mount-Rath-Maryborough-West-Queens.php | via = libraryireland.com | author = Samuel Lewis | title = A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland | date = 1837 }}</ref>\n\n:''\"an extensive factory for spinning and weaving cotton is carried on by Mr. Greenham, who employs 150 persons in the spinning mills, and about 500 in weaving calicoes at their own houses; the average quantity manufactured is from 200 to 250 pieces weekly. Stuff-weaving is also carried on extensively; there is a large brewery and malting establishment, and an extensive oil mill; and the inhabitants carry on a very extensive country trade.\"''\n\nIn the latter portion of the eighteenth and early nineteenth twentieth century, the [[Orange Order]] was strong in the town of Mountrath and surrounding townships. Older leases granted on the Castlecoote estate, on which the town was built, were written in strict accordance with the Penal Laws,  and contained a clause prohibiting the letting, selling, or bestowal of ground for the purpose of erecting a [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In consequence of this prohibition, the place of worship used by local Catholics stood upon a sand-bank beside a tributary of the [[River Nore]] called 'The Brook\".{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1794, Dr. Delany, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin proposed to build a parish church. Lord Castlecoote was publicly opposed to the proposal but the political climate of toleration that followed the Relief Act of 1793 encouraged the bishop. He made application for a site to Mr. Hawkesworth, agent to Lord Castlecoote. This gentleman found Dr. Delany a suitable plot from his own landholdings and shortly after, through his influence with the proprietor, procured a perpetual peppercorn lease as a site for a parish church. Building commenced about 1795.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn 18 April 1809, the Convent of St. Brigid, at Mountrath, was founded by three sisters from the mother house at Tullow. Soon after, the Monastery of St. Patrick was established. Both convent and monastery communities were employed in the education of Roman Catholic pupils. A new church was completed in 1867.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn October 2017 the Bridgidine Sisters gifted the Convent to the community of Mountrath for the long term benefit and development of the town and surrounding areas. In 2018 a fitness and martial arts academy opened its doors to the public offering Karate, Jujitsu, Kickboxing and Fitness classes. In 2018, building work commenced on a new Enterprise Hub and Community Centre within the confines of the Convent buildings.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Places of interest==\nNear Mountrath on the R445 towards [[Portlaoise]] is a shapeless old Wish Tree in the form of a [[Sycamore Maple|Sycamore]] tree called ''St Fintan's Well''. The original well was filled in, but the water re-appeared in the centre of the tree. Hundreds of [[pennies]] have been beaten into the bark as good luck offerings, until they eventually had apparently killed the tree but it began to sprout new shoots from its trunk and is growing again.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\">Wilkinson, Gerald (1976).
