Regional differences in the tumour (''e.g.'' availability of oxygen) impose different selective pressures on tumour cells, leading to a wider spectrum of dominant subclones in different spatial regions of the tumour. The influence of microenvironment on clonal dominance is also a likely reason for the heterogeneity between primary and [[Metastasis|metastatic]] tumours seen in many patients, as well as the inter-tumour heterogeneity observed between patients with the same tumour type.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 24048067\n| year = 2013\n| last1 = Junttila\n| first1 = M.

This is attributed to clonal interactions that may inhibit or alter therapeutic efficacy, posing a challenge for successful therapies in heterogeneic tumours (and their heterogeneic metastases).<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n\nDrug administration in heterogeneic tumours will seldom kill all tumour cells. The initial heterogeneic tumour population may [[population bottleneck|bottleneck]], such that few drug resistant cells (if any) will survive. This allows resistant tumour populations to replicate and grow a new tumour through the branching evolution mechanism (see above). The resulting repopulated tumour is heterogeneic and resistant to the initial drug therapy used. The repopulated tumour may also return in a more aggressive manner.\n\nThe administration of [[Chemotherapy|cytotoxic drugs]] often results in initial tumour shrinkage. This represents the destruction of initial non-resistant subclonal populations within a heterogeneic tumour, leaving only resistant clones. These resistant clones now contain a selective advantage and can replicate to repopulate the tumour. Replication will likely occur through branching evolution, contributing to tumour heterogeneity. The repopulated tumour may appear to be more aggressive. This is attributed to the drug-resistant selective advantage of the tumour cells.\n\n[[File:Tumour heterogeneity treatment bottleneck.pdf|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Drug treatment induces a bottleneck effect, where resistant subclones will survive and propagate to re-form a heterogeneous tumour.]]\n\n===Biomarker discovery===\nDue to the genetic differences within and between tumours, [[biomarker]]s that may predict treatment response or prognosis may not be widely applicable. However, it has been suggested that the level of heterogeneity can itself be used as a biomarker since more heterogeneous tumours may be more likely to contain treatment-resistant subclones.<ref name=\"Marusyk2012\" /> Further research into developing biomarkers that account for heterogeneity is still in progress.\n\n=== Model systems ===\nCurrent model systems typically lack the heterogeneity seen in human cancers.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines Lack the Molecular Heterogeneity of Clinical Colorectal Tumors|journal = Clinical Colorectal Cancer|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.3816/ccc.2010.n.005|first = James Todd|last = Auman|first2 = Howard L.|last2 = McLeod|pages=40\u201347}}</ref> In order to accurately study tumour heterogeneity, we must develop more accurate preclinical models.

This may occur through the detection of allelic imbalances (tumour DNA is compared to germline DNA), amplification of chromosomal regions ([[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]]), and/or sequencing specific genes. This method is used to trace the evolution of a specific mutation of interest, or to confirm a mutation researchers may suspect in a tumour.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Advantage: Allows for the analysis of specific genes (''i.e.'' driver genes, tumour suppressors). The process is simple with straightforward interpretation of the results. [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] and [[immunofluorescence]] allows focus on tumour cell subtypes.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Disadvantage: Limited analysis will miss additional important mutations and patterns of clonal expansion. Allelic imbalances may be difficult to verify using microsatellite markers, therefore requiring verification by an independent technique (''i.e.'' FISH). [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] requires large number of cells and is labour-intensive.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n* '''Genome-wide approach:''' analyzing the entire genome in tumour samples. This may be done through [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] or [[Comparative genomic hybridization| comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)]] to detect chromosomal abnormalities. Sequencing of tumour biopsies is becoming more common.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Advantage: Does not rely on prior knowledge to identify variants. [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] identifies regions of large chromosomal abnormalities. [[Comparative genomic hybridization|CGH]] provides unbiased coverage and allows for small-scale allelic imbalances to be detected [[SNP array|(SNP arrays)]]. Sequencing will identify any variants that contribute to tumour heterogeneity.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Disadvantage: Difficult to determine the functional impact of variants (''i.e.'' neutral or pathogenic). Limited resolution.  [[Karyotype|Karyotyping]] of cultured cells may be biased towards preferential outgrowth of select tumour cell subpopulations. Limited resolution in both methods.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" /> The whole-genome approach may generate large amounts of data and be difficult to interpret.\n* '''Multiregion sampling strategy:''' generally requires multiple post-surgical tumour samples from separate regions of a microdissected tumour. It is important to avoid contamination of non-malignant cells to ensure an accurate representation of gene expression and genetic composition seen within the tumour cells only. Analysis of tumour DNA within the spatially separated regions allows for the construction of a 3-dimensional evolutionary model of tumour heterogeneity.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" /> Multiregional sampling is often used in combination with the genome-wide approach to establish this 3D heterogeneity expansion model.\n* '''Longitudinal sampling:''' through tumour progression or treatment progression, obtaining tumour samples during multiple points in time has been utilized in some cases. This has been suggested as a reliable method for tracking clonal evolution.<ref name=\"Ding2012\" /><ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors= Bai H, Harmanc\u0131 AS, Erson-Omay AZ, Li J, Co\u0219kun S, Simon M, Krischek B, \u00d6zduman K, Omay SB | display-authors = 6 |title = Integrated genomic characterization of IDH1-mutant glioma malignant progression | date = Nov 2015 | journal = Nature Genetics | doi = 10.1038/ng.3457 | pmid=26618343 | pmc=4829945 | volume=48 | issue = 1 | pages=59\u201366}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 24048068\n| year = 2013\n| last1 = Bedard\n| first1 = P.

The presence of heterogeneous tumour populations (subclones) introduces additional challenges such as:\n** The inability to detect [[mutation]]s in rare subclones. Since these mutations will occur with low frequency in the pooled sample, they may be indistinguishable from background noise.

These cells are termed cancer stem cells ('''CSCs'''), and are marked by the ability to both self-renew and differentiate into non-tumourigenic progeny. The CSC model posits that the heterogeneity observed between tumour cells is the result of differences in the stem cells from which they originated. Stem cell variability is often caused by [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes, but can also result from clonal evolution of the CSC population where advantageous genetic [[mutation]]s can accumulate in CSCs and their progeny (see below).<ref name=\"Shackleton2009\" />\n\nEvidence of the cancer stem cell model has been demonstrated in multiple tumour types including [[leukemias]],<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 7509044\n| year = 1994\n| last1 = Lapidot\n| first1 = T\n| title = A cell initiating human acute myeloid leukaemia after transplantation into SCID mice\n| journal = Nature\n| volume = 367\n| issue = 6464\n| pages = 645\u2013648\n| last2 = Sirard\n| first2 = C\n| last3 = Vormoor\n| first3 = J\n| last4 = Murdoch\n| first4 = B\n| last5 = Hoang\n| first5 = T\n| last6 = Caceres-Cortes\n| first6 = J\n| last7 = Minden\n| first7 = M\n| last8 = Paterson\n| first8 = B\n| last9 = Caligiuri\n| first9 = M.

This is attributed to clonal interactions that may inhibit or alter therapeutic efficacy, posing a challenge for successful therapies in heterogeneic tumours (and their heterogeneic metastases).<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n\nDrug administration in heterogeneic tumours will seldom kill all tumour cells. The initial heterogeneic tumour population may [[population bottleneck|bottleneck]], such that few drug resistant cells (if any) will survive. This allows resistant tumour populations to replicate and grow a new tumour through the branching evolution mechanism (see above). The resulting repopulated tumour is heterogeneic and resistant to the initial drug therapy used. The repopulated tumour may also return in a more aggressive manner.\n\nThe administration of [[Chemotherapy|cytotoxic drugs]] often results in initial tumour shrinkage. This represents the destruction of initial non-resistant subclonal populations within a heterogeneic tumour, leaving only resistant clones. These resistant clones now contain a selective advantage and can replicate to repopulate the tumour. Replication will likely occur through branching evolution, contributing to tumour heterogeneity. The repopulated tumour may appear to be more aggressive. This is attributed to the drug-resistant selective advantage of the tumour cells.\n\n[[File:Tumour heterogeneity treatment bottleneck.pdf|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Drug treatment induces a bottleneck effect, where resistant subclones will survive and propagate to re-form a heterogeneous tumour.]]\n\n===Biomarker discovery===\nDue to the genetic differences within and between tumours, [[biomarker]]s that may predict treatment response or prognosis may not be widely applicable.

This may occur through the detection of allelic imbalances (tumour DNA is compared to germline DNA), amplification of chromosomal regions ([[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]]), and/or sequencing specific genes. This method is used to trace the evolution of a specific mutation of interest, or to confirm a mutation researchers may suspect in a tumour.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Advantage: Allows for the analysis of specific genes (''i.e.'' driver genes, tumour suppressors). The process is simple with straightforward interpretation of the results. [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] and [[immunofluorescence]] allows focus on tumour cell subtypes.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Disadvantage: Limited analysis will miss additional important mutations and patterns of clonal expansion. Allelic imbalances may be difficult to verify using microsatellite markers, therefore requiring verification by an independent technique (''i.e.'' FISH). [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] requires large number of cells and is labour-intensive.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n* '''Genome-wide approach:''' analyzing the entire genome in tumour samples. This may be done through [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] or [[Comparative genomic hybridization| comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)]] to detect chromosomal abnormalities. Sequencing of tumour biopsies is becoming more common.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Advantage: Does not rely on prior knowledge to identify variants. [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] identifies regions of large chromosomal abnormalities. [[Comparative genomic hybridization|CGH]] provides unbiased coverage and allows for small-scale allelic imbalances to be detected [[SNP array|(SNP arrays)]]. Sequencing will identify any variants that contribute to tumour heterogeneity.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" />\n** Disadvantage: Difficult to determine the functional impact of variants (''i.e.'' neutral or pathogenic). Limited resolution.  [[Karyotype|Karyotyping]] of cultured cells may be biased towards preferential outgrowth of select tumour cell subpopulations. Limited resolution in both methods.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" /> The whole-genome approach may generate large amounts of data and be difficult to interpret.\n* '''Multiregion sampling strategy:''' generally requires multiple post-surgical tumour samples from separate regions of a microdissected tumour. It is important to avoid contamination of non-malignant cells to ensure an accurate representation of gene expression and genetic composition seen within the tumour cells only. Analysis of tumour DNA within the spatially separated regions allows for the construction of a 3-dimensional evolutionary model of tumour heterogeneity.<ref name=\"Marusyk2010\" /> Multiregional sampling is often used in combination with the genome-wide approach to establish this 3D heterogeneity expansion model.\n* '''Longitudinal sampling:''' through tumour progression or treatment progression, obtaining tumour samples during multiple points in time has been utilized in some cases. This has been suggested as a reliable method for tracking clonal evolution.<ref name=\"Ding2012\" /><ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors= Bai H, Harmanc\u0131 AS, Erson-Omay AZ, Li J, Co\u0219kun S, Simon M, Krischek B, \u00d6zduman K, Omay SB | display-authors = 6 |title = Integrated genomic characterization of IDH1-mutant glioma malignant progression | date = Nov 2015 | journal = Nature Genetics | doi = 10.1038/ng.3457 | pmid=26618343 | pmc=4829945 | volume=48 | issue = 1 | pages=59\u201366}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 24048068\n| year = 2013\n| last1 = Bedard\n| first1 = P.

While with current technology, it is difficult to evaluate sufficiently large numbers of single cells to obtain statistical power, single-cell tumour data has multiple advantages, including:\n** The ability to construct a [[phylogenetic tree]] showing the evolution of tumour populations. Using whole-genome sequences or [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]-based pseudo-sequences from individual cells, the evolution of the subclones can be estimated.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

They released their debut single, \"[[Teach Me How to Dougie]]\", produced by ''Runway Star'' of [http://www.makerzmusic.com/ ''The Makerz'']<ref>[http://makerzmusic.com \"Runway Star for The Makerz\"], ''makerzmusic.com'', Sept 7, 2013, accessed Sept 7, 2013.</ref> production team on April 13, 2010. It became a commercial success, peaking at twenty-eight on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], nine on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, and six on the US [[Rap Songs]] chart. The songs success led the \"[[Dougie (dance)|Dougie]]\" to become one of the most popular dances of 2010. The song's follow-up, \"Where You Are\", was released on September 7, 2010. It samples [[Michael Jackson]]'s 1972 hit, \"[[I Wanna Be Where You Are]]\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/08/11/new-music-cali-swag-district-where-you-are/ | title=New Music: Cali Swag District \u2013 \u2018Where You Are\u2019 | date=August 11, 2010 | accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> The song only managed to peak at forty-five on US R&B charts and twenty-two on US Rap charts. The group's third single, \"Kickback\", was released on January 18, 2011. The single peaked at ninety-one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Due to album pushbacks, much of ''The Kickback'' was re-worked, resulting in \"Where You Are\" being cut from it, making \"Teach Me How to Dougie\" and the title track its first two singles.\n\nWith the album delayed and the future of Capitol Records parent company, EMI, unclear, CSD requested to be released from their contract with Capitol. The group eventually signed with Sphinx Music Entertainment/319 Music Group and ''The Kickback'' was distributed by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]]/[[RED Distribution|RED]] on July 12, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cali Swag District Overcomes Member's Death on Debut LP|publisher=Billboard magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/469221/cali-swag-district-overcomes-members-death-on-debut-lp}}</ref>\n\n== Members' deaths ==\nMontae Talbert, known in the group as \"M-Bone\", was shot on May 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cali Swag District's M-Bone Dead From Gunshot Wounds|publisher=HipHopDX|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15129/title.cali-swag-districts-m-bone-dead-from-gunshot-wounds|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904082431/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15129/title.cali-swag-districts-m-bone-dead-from-gunshot-wounds|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cali Swag District Rapper M-Bone Killed In Drive-By Shooting|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663922/cali-swag-district-m-bone-shooting-death.jhtml}}</ref> The 22-year-old rapper was the victim of a drive-by shooting in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]].

He also documented controversy surrounding ''OK'' and the history of its [[False etymology|folk etymologies]], both of which are intertwined with the history of the word itself.  Read argues that, at the time of the expression's first appearance in print, a broader [[fad]] existed in the United States of \"comical misspellings\" and of forming and employing acronyms, themselves based on colloquial speech patterns:\n\n{{quote|The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 ... and used expressions like OFM, \"our first men,\" NG, \"no go,\" GT, \"gone to Texas,\" and SP, \"small potatoes.\" Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings, a stock in trade of the humorists of the day. One predecessor of OK was OW, \"oll wright.\"{{sfn|Adams|1985}}}}\n\nThe general fad is speculated to have existed in spoken or informal written U.S. English for a decade or more before its appearance in newspapers. ''OK''{{'}}s original presentation as \"all correct\" was later varied with spellings such as \"Oll Korrect\" or even \"Ole Kurreck\".\n\nThe term appears to have achieved national prominence in 1840, when supporters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic political party]] claimed during the [[1840 United States presidential election]] that it stood for \"Old Kinderhook\", a nickname for the Democratic president and candidate for reelection, [[Martin Van Buren]], a native of [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook, New York]]. \"Vote for OK\" was snappier than using his Dutch name.{{sfn|The Economist|2002}} In response, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] opponents attributed ''OK'', in the sense of \"Oll Korrect,\" to the bad spelling of [[Andrew Jackson]], Van Buren's predecessor. The country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in ''OK''{{'}}s history, widely and suddenly popularizing it across the United States.\n\nRead proposed an etymology of ''OK'' in \"Old Kinderhook\" in 1941.{{sfn|Read|1941}} The evidence presented in that article was somewhat sparse, and the connection to \"Oll Korrect\" not fully elucidated. Various challenges to the etymology were presented; e.g., Heflin's 1962 article.{{sfn|Heflin|1962}} However, Read's landmark 1963\u20131964 papers silenced most of the skepticism.  Read's etymology gained immediate acceptance, and is now offered without reservation in most dictionaries.<ref>Online edition of  [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/OK ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' [Houghton Mifflin&#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102657/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/OK |date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>  Read himself was nevertheless open to evaluating alternative explanations:\n\n{{quote|Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest.

Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. \"Nothing is absolute,\" he once wrote, \"nothing is forever.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Allen Read|url=https://www.economist.com/node/1403400|accessdate=29 December 2014|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=24 October 2002|ref={{harvid|The Economist|2002}}}}</ref>}}\n\n===Choctaw===\nIn \"All Mixed Up\", the folk singer [[Pete Seeger]] sang that ''OK'' was of [[Choctaw]] origin,{{sfn|Fay|2007}} as the dictionaries of the time tended to agree. Three major American reference works (Webster's, New Century, Funk & Wagnalls) cited this etymology as the probable origin until as late as 1961.{{sfn|Fay|2007}}\n\nThe earliest written evidence for the Choctaw origin is provided in work by the Christian missionaries [[Cyrus Byington]] and Alfred Wright in 1825. These missionaries ended many sentences in their translation of the Bible with the particle \"okeh\", meaning \"it is so\", which was listed as an alternative spelling in the 1913 Webster's.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/okeh \"okeh\"].

Similar particles exist in native language groups distinct from Iroquoian ([[Algonquian (language)|Algonquian]], [[Cree]] cf. \"[http://www.creedictionary.com/search/index.php?q=ekosi&scope=1 ekosi]\").\n\n===West African===\nA verifiable early written attestation of the particle 'kay' is from transcription by Smyth (1784) of a North Carolina slave not wanting to be flogged by a European visiting America:\n\n{{quote|Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; ...{{sfn|Smyth|1784|pp=1:118-21}}}}\n\nA West African (Mande and/or Bantu) etymology has been argued in scholarly sources, tracing the word back to the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] word ''waw-kay'' or the [[Mande languages|Mande]] (aka \"Mandinke\" or \"Mandingo\") phrase ''o ke''.\n\nDavid Dalby first made the claim that the particle ''OK'' could have African origins in the 1969 Hans Wolff Memorial Lecture. His argument was reprinted in various newspaper articles between 1969 and 1971.{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}} This suggestion has also been mentioned more recently by Joseph Holloway, who argued in the 1993 book ''The African Heritage of American English'' (co-written with a retired missionary) that various West African languages have near-homophone discourse markers with meanings such as \"yes indeed\" or which serve as part of the [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling]] repertoire.<ref name=\"Yngve, Victor page 568\"/>{{sfn|Holloway|Vass|1993}} Though Frederic Cassidy challenged Dalby's claims, asserting that there is no documentary evidence that any of these African-language words had any causal link with its use in the American press,{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}  one can certainly wonder at the fact that this standard of written proof does not account for the illiteracy in which the West African speakers were kept during the period of slavery in question.\n\nThe West African hypothesis had not been accepted by 1981 by any etymologists,{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}<ref name=\"onlineetym\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ok|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"lighter\">Lighter, Jonathon, (1994).

Some of them are thought to fall into the category of [[False etymology|folk etymology]] and are proposed based merely on apparent similarity between ''OK'' and one or another phrase in a foreign language with a similar meaning and sound.  Some examples are:\n\n*A corruption from the speech of the large number of descendants of Scottish and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (Scots-Irish) immigrants to North America, of the common Scots phrase ''och aye'' (\"oh yes\").{{sfn|Read|1964}}\n*A borrowing of the [[Greek language|Greek]] phrase {{lang|el|\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac}} ({{transl|el|''\u00f3la kal\u00e1''}}), meaning \"all good\".{{sfn|Weber|1942}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[Allen Walker Read]] identifies the earliest known use of ''O.K.'' in print as 1839, in the edition of 23 March of the ''[[Boston Morning Post]]''. The announcement of a trip by the Anti-Bell-Ringing Society (a \"frolicsome group\" according to Read) received attention from the Boston papers. Charles Gordon Greene wrote about the event using the line that is widely regarded as the first instance of this strain of ''OK'', complete with [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]]:\n\n{{quote|The above is from the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', the editor of which is a little too quick on the trigger, on this occasion. We said not a word about our deputation passing \"through the city\" of Providence.\u2014We said our brethren were going to New York in the Richmond, and they did go, as per Post of Thursday. The \"Chairman of the Committee on Charity Lecture Bells,\" is one of the deputation, and perhaps if he should return to Boston, via Providence, he of the Journal, and his ''train''-band, would have his \"contribution box,\" et ceteras, ''o.k.''\u2014all correct\u2014and cause the corks to fly, like ''sparks'', upward.}}\n\nRead gives a number of subsequent appearances in print. Seven instances were accompanied with glosses that were variations on \"all correct\" such as \"oll korrect\" or \"ole kurreck\", but five appeared with no accompanying explanation, suggesting that the word was expected to be well known to readers and possibly in common colloquial use at the time.\n\nVarious claims of earlier usage have been made.  For example, it was claimed that the phrase appeared in a 1790 court record from [[Sumner County, Tennessee]], discovered in 1859 by a [[Tennessee]] historian named [[Albigence Waldo Putnam]], in which [[Andrew Jackson]] apparently said \"proved a bill of sale from Hugh McGary to Gasper Mansker, for an uncalled good, which was O.K.\".<ref>George W. Stimpson. (1934) \"Nuggets Of Knowledge\"</ref> However, Read challenged such claims, and his assertions have been generally accepted. The great lawyer who successfully argued many Indian rights claims,{{clarify|post-text=(Who?)|date=January 2019}} however, supports the Jacksonian popularization of the term based on its Choctaw origin.<ref>Felix S. Cohen, \"Americanizing the White Man,\" ''The American Scholar'' vol. 21, no. 2 (Spring 1952): 177-191</ref>\n\nDavid Dalby (see above) brought up some other earlier attested usages.  One example from 1941 is the apparent notation \"we arrived ok\" in the hand-written diary of William Richardson going from Boston to New Orleans in 1815, about a month after the Battle of New Orleans.{{sfn|Heflin|1941|p=90}} Frederic Cassidy asserts that he personally tracked down this diary and notes that:\n\n{{quote|After many attempts to track down this diary, Read and I at last discovered that it is owned by the grandson of the original writer, Professor L. Richardson, Jr., of the Department of Classical Studies at Duke University. Through his courtesy we were able to examine this manuscript carefully, to make greatly enlarged photographs of it, and to become convinced (as is Richardson) that, whatever the marks in the manuscript are, they are not OK.{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}}}\n\nSimilarly, [[H. L. Mencken]], who originally considered it \"very clear that 'o. k.' is actually in the manuscript\",{{sfn|Wait|1941}} later recanted his endorsement of the expression, asserting that it was used no earlier than 1839. Mencken (following Read) described the diary entry as a misreading of the author's self-correction, and stated it was in reality the first two letters of the words ''a h[andsome]'' before noticing the phrase had been used in the previous line and changing his mind.{{sfn|Mencken|1945|p=275}}\n\nAnother example given by Dalby is a Jamaican planter's diary of 1816, which records a black slave saying \"Oh ki, massa, doctor no need be fright, we no want to hurt him\".<ref>David Dalby ([[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in West African Languages, SOAS, U of London). (1971) \"The Etymology of O.K.,\" ''The Times'', 14 January 1971</ref> Cassidy asserts that this is a misreading of the source, which actually begins \"Oh, ki, massa ...\", where ''ki'' is a phrase by itself:\n\n{{quote|In all other examples of this interjection that I have found, it is simply ''ki'' (once spelled ''kie''). As here, it expresses surprise, amusement, satisfaction, mild expostulation, and the like. It has nothing like the meaning of the adjective OK, which in the earliest recorded examples means 'all right, good,' though it later acquires other meanings, but even when used as an interjection does not express surprise, expostulation, or anything similar.{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}}}\n\n==Variations==\nWhether this word is printed as OK, Ok, ok, okay, or O.K. is a matter normally resolved in the style manual for the publication involved. Dictionaries and style guides such as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' and ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' provide no consensus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2008/09/im-ok-youre-okay.html |title=I'm OK, you're okay |publisher=Grammarphobia |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Variation!!Where used/Origins\n|-\n|okeh|| Choctaw word for 'it is so' (see above).

Spanish speakers often spell the word \"okey\" to conform with the spelling rules of the language. In Brazil, it may be also pronounced as \"\u00f4-kei\". In Portugal, it is used with its Portuguese pronunciation and sounds something like \"\u00f3k\u00e2i\" (similar to the English pronunciation but with the \"\u00f3\" sounding like the \"o\" in \"lost\" or \"top\"), or even as 'oh-kapa', from the letters ''O'' ('\u00f3') and ''K'' ('capa'). In [[Spain]] it's much less common than in Latin American countries (words such as \"vale\" or \"de acuerdo\" are preferred) but it may still be heard.\n\nIn [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]], ''OK'' has become part of the everyday [[Dutch language|Dutch]] language. It is pronounced the same way.\n\n[[Arabic]] speakers also use the word (\u0623\u0648\u0643\u064a) widely, particularly in areas of former British presence like Egypt, Jordan, Israel/Palestine and [[Iraq]], but also all over the Arab world due to the prevalence of American cinema and television. It is pronounced just as it is in English but is very rarely seen in Arabic newspapers and formal media.\n\nIn [[Hebrew]], the word ''OK'' is common as an equivalent to the Hebrew word \u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 [b'seder] ('adequate', 'in order'). It is written as it sounds in English \u05d0\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05d9.\n\nIt is used in Japan and Korea in a somewhat restricted sense, fairly equivalent to \"all right\". ''OK'' is often used in colloquial Japanese as a replacement for \u5927\u4e08\u592b (daij\u014dbu \"all right\")\u3000or \u3044\u3044 (ii \"good\") and often followed by \u3067\u3059 (desu \u2013 the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]). A transliteration of the English word, written as \u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc (lit. \"\u014dk\u0113\") or \u30aa\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc (lit. \"okk\u0113\") is also often used in the same manner as the English, and is becoming more popular in recent years. In Korean, \uc624\ucf00\uc774 (literally \"okay\") can be used colloquially in place of \ub124 (ne, \"yes\") when expressing approval or acknowledgment.\n\nIn Chinese, the term {{Zh|c=\u597d|p=h\u01ceo| labels=no}} (literally: \"good\"), can be modified to fit most of usages of ''OK''. For example, {{zh|c=\u597d\u4e86|p=h\u01ceo le| labels=no}} closely resembles the [[interjection]] usage of ''OK''. The \"\u4e86\" indicates a change of state; in this case it indicates the achievement of consensus. Likewise, ''OK'' is commonly transformed into \"OK\u4e86\" (OK le) when communicating with foreigners or with fellow Cantonese speaking people in at least Hong Kong and possibly to an extent other regions of China.<ref>3 min 37 s video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSHziqJWYcM Youtube.com]</ref> Other usages of ''OK'' such as \"I am OK\" can be translated as {{zh|s=\u6211\u8fd8\u597d|p=w\u01d2 h\u00e1i h\u01ceo| labels=no}}. In Hong Kong, movies or dramas set in modern times use the term ''okay'' as part of the sprinkling of English included in otherwise Cantonese dialog.  In [[Mandarin Chinese]] it is also somewhat humorously used in the \"spelling\" of the word for karaoke, \"[[wikt:\u5361\u62c9OK|\u5361\u62c9OK]]\", pronounced \"kah-lah-oh-kei\" (Mandarin does not natively have a syllable with the pronunciation \"kei\"). On the computer, OK is usually translated as {{zh|c=\u786e\u5b9a|p=qu\u00e8d\u00ecng| labels=no}}, which means \"confirm\" or \"confirmed\".\n\nIn [[Taiwan]], ''OK'' is frequently used in various sentences, popular among but not limited to younger generations. This includes the aforementioned \"OK\u4e86\" (Okay le), \"OK\u55ce\" (Okay ma), meaning \"Is it okay?\" or \"OK\u5566\" (Okay la), a strong, persuading affirmative, as well as the somewhat tongue-in-cheek explicit yes/no construction \"O\u4e0dOK\uff1f\" (O b\u00f9 OK?), \"Is it OK or not?\"\n\nIn [[Russia]], ''OK'' is used very frequently for any positive meaning. The word in Russian has many morphologies: \"\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439\", \"\u043e\u043a\u0435\u044e\u0448\u043a\u0438\", \"\u043e\u043a\", \"\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\", etc.\n\nIn [[France]] and [[Belgium]], ''OK'' is used to communicate agreement, and is generally followed by a French phrase (e.g. ''OK, d'accord'', \"Okay, chef\")  or another borrowing (e.g., ''OK, boss. ok, bye.''). Rarely pronounced /\u0254k/ these days, except by young children encountering dialog boxes for the first times.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]] \"okay lang\" is a common expression, literally meaning \"just okay\" or \"just fine\". Sometimes spelled as ''okey''.\n\nIn [[Malay language|Malay]], it is frequently used with the emphatic suffix \"lah\": OK-lah.\n\nIn [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], it is spelled \"\u00d4 k\u00ea\".\n\nIn [[India]], it is often used after a sentence to mean \"did you get it?\", often not regarded politely, for example, \"I want this job done, OK?\" or at the end of a conversation (mostly on the phone) followed by \"bye\" as in \"OK, bye.\"\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], ''OK'' is also used as a slogan of national television station [[RCTI]] since the year 1994.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], ''OK'' has become a part of Urdu and Punjabi languages.\n\nIn [[Germany]], ''OK'' is spelled as ''o.k.'' or ''O.K.'' or ''okay''. It may be pronounced as in English, but /\u0254\u02c8ke\u02d0/ or /o\u02c8ke\u02d0/ are also common.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/o__k_|title=Duden {{!}} o. k. {{!}} Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition, Herkunft|website=www.duden.de|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The meaning ranges from acknowledgement to describing something neither good nor bad, same as in US/UK usage.\n\nIn [[Maldivian language|Maldivian]] Okay is used in different ways, often used to agree with something, more often used while departing from a gathering \"Okay Dahnee/Kendee.\"\n\nIn [[Singapore]], ''OK'' is often used with suffixes used in \"[[Singlish]]\" such as ''OK lor'', ''OK lah'', ''OK meh'', ''OK leh'', which are used in different occasions.\n\n==Gesture==\n{{Main|OK gesture}}\n[[File:OK Sign.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Okay sign]]\nIn the United States and much of Europe a related [[gesture]] is made by touching the index finger with the thumb (forming a rough circle) and raising of the remaining fingers.<ref name=FGuide>Armstrong, Nancy & Melissa Wagner.

''OK'' is frequently used as a [[loanword]] in other languages. It has been described as the most frequently spoken or written word on the planet.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1455146/ok-most-spoken-word-planet-marks-its-175th-anniversary \"OK, 'most spoken word on the planet', marks its 175th anniversary\"] South China Morning Post. 23 March 2014.</ref> The origins of the word are disputed.\n\nAs an [[adjective]], ''OK'' principally means \"adequate\" or \"acceptable\" as a contrast to \"bad\" (\"The boss approved this, so it is OK to send out\"); it can also mean \"mediocre\" when used in contrast with \"good\" (\"The french fries were great, but the burger was just OK\"). It fulfills a similar role as an adverb (\"Wow, you did OK for your first time skiing!\"). As an [[interjection]], it can denote compliance (\"OK, I will do that\"), or agreement (\"OK, that is fine\"). It can mean \"assent\" when it is used as a [[noun]] (\"the boss gave her the OK to the purchase\") or, more colloquially, as a [[verb]] (\"the boss OKed the purchase\"). ''OK'', as an adjective, can express acknowledgement without approval.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beaver|first=David|title=Not OK.|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2979|work=languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu|accessdate=10 December 2014|authorlink=David Beaver|date=20 February 2011|ref=harv}}</ref> As a versatile discourse marker or [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling]] item, it can also be used with appropriate [[Nonverbal communication#Paralanguage: nonverbal cues of the voice|voice tone]] to show doubt or to seek confirmation (\"OK?\", \"Is that OK?\").<ref name=\"Yngve, Victor page 568\">Yngve, Victor. \"On getting a word in edgewise,\" page 568.

He also documented controversy surrounding ''OK'' and the history of its [[False etymology|folk etymologies]], both of which are intertwined with the history of the word itself.  Read argues that, at the time of the expression's first appearance in print, a broader [[fad]] existed in the United States of \"comical misspellings\" and of forming and employing acronyms, themselves based on colloquial speech patterns:\n\n{{quote|The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 ... and used expressions like OFM, \"our first men,\" NG, \"no go,\" GT, \"gone to Texas,\" and SP, \"small potatoes.\" Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings, a stock in trade of the humorists of the day. One predecessor of OK was OW, \"oll wright.\"{{sfn|Adams|1985}}}}\n\nThe general fad is speculated to have existed in spoken or informal written U.S. English for a decade or more before its appearance in newspapers. ''OK''{{'}}s original presentation as \"all correct\" was later varied with spellings such as \"Oll Korrect\" or even \"Ole Kurreck\".\n\nThe term appears to have achieved national prominence in 1840, when supporters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic political party]] claimed during the [[1840 United States presidential election]] that it stood for \"Old Kinderhook\", a nickname for the Democratic president and candidate for reelection, [[Martin Van Buren]], a native of [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook, New York]]. \"Vote for OK\" was snappier than using his Dutch name.{{sfn|The Economist|2002}} In response, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] opponents attributed ''OK'', in the sense of \"Oll Korrect,\" to the bad spelling of [[Andrew Jackson]], Van Buren's predecessor. The country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in ''OK''{{'}}s history, widely and suddenly popularizing it across the United States.\n\nRead proposed an etymology of ''OK'' in \"Old Kinderhook\" in 1941.{{sfn|Read|1941}} The evidence presented in that article was somewhat sparse, and the connection to \"Oll Korrect\" not fully elucidated. Various challenges to the etymology were presented; e.g., Heflin's 1962 article.{{sfn|Heflin|1962}} However, Read's landmark 1963\u20131964 papers silenced most of the skepticism.  Read's etymology gained immediate acceptance, and is now offered without reservation in most dictionaries.<ref>Online edition of  [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/OK ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' [Houghton Mifflin&#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102657/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/OK |date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>  Read himself was nevertheless open to evaluating alternative explanations:\n\n{{quote|Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest. Some are attracted to the claim that it is of American-Indian origin. There is an Indian word, okeh, used as an affirmative reply to a question. Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. \"Nothing is absolute,\" he once wrote, \"nothing is forever.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Allen Read|url=https://www.economist.com/node/1403400|accessdate=29 December 2014|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=24 October 2002|ref={{harvid|The Economist|2002}}}}</ref>}}\n\n===Choctaw===\nIn \"All Mixed Up\", the folk singer [[Pete Seeger]] sang that ''OK'' was of [[Choctaw]] origin,{{sfn|Fay|2007}} as the dictionaries of the time tended to agree. Three major American reference works (Webster's, New Century, Funk & Wagnalls) cited this etymology as the probable origin until as late as 1961.{{sfn|Fay|2007}}\n\nThe earliest written evidence for the Choctaw origin is provided in work by the Christian missionaries [[Cyrus Byington]] and Alfred Wright in 1825. These missionaries ended many sentences in their translation of the Bible with the particle \"okeh\", meaning \"it is so\", which was listed as an alternative spelling in the 1913 Webster's.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/okeh \"okeh\"].

Similar particles exist in native language groups distinct from Iroquoian ([[Algonquian (language)|Algonquian]], [[Cree]] cf. \"[http://www.creedictionary.com/search/index.php?q=ekosi&scope=1 ekosi]\").\n\n===West African===\nA verifiable early written attestation of the particle 'kay' is from transcription by Smyth (1784) of a North Carolina slave not wanting to be flogged by a European visiting America:\n\n{{quote|Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; ...{{sfn|Smyth|1784|pp=1:118-21}}}}\n\nA West African (Mande and/or Bantu) etymology has been argued in scholarly sources, tracing the word back to the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] word ''waw-kay'' or the [[Mande languages|Mande]] (aka \"Mandinke\" or \"Mandingo\") phrase ''o ke''.\n\nDavid Dalby first made the claim that the particle ''OK'' could have African origins in the 1969 Hans Wolff Memorial Lecture. His argument was reprinted in various newspaper articles between 1969 and 1971.{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}} This suggestion has also been mentioned more recently by Joseph Holloway, who argued in the 1993 book ''The African Heritage of American English'' (co-written with a retired missionary) that various West African languages have near-homophone discourse markers with meanings such as \"yes indeed\" or which serve as part of the [[Backchannel (linguistics)|back-channeling]] repertoire.<ref name=\"Yngve, Victor page 568\"/>{{sfn|Holloway|Vass|1993}} Though Frederic Cassidy challenged Dalby's claims, asserting that there is no documentary evidence that any of these African-language words had any causal link with its use in the American press,{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}  one can certainly wonder at the fact that this standard of written proof does not account for the illiteracy in which the West African speakers were kept during the period of slavery in question.\n\nThe West African hypothesis had not been accepted by 1981 by any etymologists,{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}<ref name=\"onlineetym\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ok|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"lighter\">Lighter, Jonathon, (1994).

Some of them are thought to fall into the category of [[False etymology|folk etymology]] and are proposed based merely on apparent similarity between ''OK'' and one or another phrase in a foreign language with a similar meaning and sound.  Some examples are:\n\n*A corruption from the speech of the large number of descendants of Scottish and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (Scots-Irish) immigrants to North America, of the common Scots phrase ''och aye'' (\"oh yes\").{{sfn|Read|1964}}\n*A borrowing of the [[Greek language|Greek]] phrase {{lang|el|\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac}} ({{transl|el|''\u00f3la kal\u00e1''}}), meaning \"all good\".{{sfn|Weber|1942}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[Allen Walker Read]] identifies the earliest known use of ''O.K.'' in print as 1839, in the edition of 23 March of the ''[[Boston Morning Post]]''. The announcement of a trip by the Anti-Bell-Ringing Society (a \"frolicsome group\" according to Read) received attention from the Boston papers. Charles Gordon Greene wrote about the event using the line that is widely regarded as the first instance of this strain of ''OK'', complete with [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]]:\n\n{{quote|The above is from the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', the editor of which is a little too quick on the trigger, on this occasion. We said not a word about our deputation passing \"through the city\" of Providence.\u2014We said our brethren were going to New York in the Richmond, and they did go, as per Post of Thursday. The \"Chairman of the Committee on Charity Lecture Bells,\" is one of the deputation, and perhaps if he should return to Boston, via Providence, he of the Journal, and his ''train''-band, would have his \"contribution box,\" et ceteras, ''o.k.''\u2014all correct\u2014and cause the corks to fly, like ''sparks'', upward.}}\n\nRead gives a number of subsequent appearances in print. Seven instances were accompanied with glosses that were variations on \"all correct\" such as \"oll korrect\" or \"ole kurreck\", but five appeared with no accompanying explanation, suggesting that the word was expected to be well known to readers and possibly in common colloquial use at the time.\n\nVarious claims of earlier usage have been made.  For example, it was claimed that the phrase appeared in a 1790 court record from [[Sumner County, Tennessee]], discovered in 1859 by a [[Tennessee]] historian named [[Albigence Waldo Putnam]], in which [[Andrew Jackson]] apparently said \"proved a bill of sale from Hugh McGary to Gasper Mansker, for an uncalled good, which was O.K.\".<ref>George W. Stimpson. (1934) \"Nuggets Of Knowledge\"</ref> However, Read challenged such claims, and his assertions have been generally accepted. The great lawyer who successfully argued many Indian rights claims,{{clarify|post-text=(Who?)|date=January 2019}} however, supports the Jacksonian popularization of the term based on its Choctaw origin.<ref>Felix S. Cohen, \"Americanizing the White Man,\" ''The American Scholar'' vol. 21, no. 2 (Spring 1952): 177-191</ref>\n\nDavid Dalby (see above) brought up some other earlier attested usages.  One example from 1941 is the apparent notation \"we arrived ok\" in the hand-written diary of William Richardson going from Boston to New Orleans in 1815, about a month after the Battle of New Orleans.{{sfn|Heflin|1941|p=90}} Frederic Cassidy asserts that he personally tracked down this diary and notes that:\n\n{{quote|After many attempts to track down this diary, Read and I at last discovered that it is owned by the grandson of the original writer, Professor L. Richardson, Jr., of the Department of Classical Studies at Duke University. Through his courtesy we were able to examine this manuscript carefully, to make greatly enlarged photographs of it, and to become convinced (as is Richardson) that, whatever the marks in the manuscript are, they are not OK.{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}}}\n\nSimilarly, [[H. L. Mencken]], who originally considered it \"very clear that 'o. k.' is actually in the manuscript\",{{sfn|Wait|1941}} later recanted his endorsement of the expression, asserting that it was used no earlier than 1839. Mencken (following Read) described the diary entry as a misreading of the author's self-correction, and stated it was in reality the first two letters of the words ''a h[andsome]'' before noticing the phrase had been used in the previous line and changing his mind.{{sfn|Mencken|1945|p=275}}\n\nAnother example given by Dalby is a Jamaican planter's diary of 1816, which records a black slave saying \"Oh ki, massa, doctor no need be fright, we no want to hurt him\".<ref>David Dalby ([[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in West African Languages, SOAS, U of London). (1971) \"The Etymology of O.K.,\" ''The Times'', 14 January 1971</ref> Cassidy asserts that this is a misreading of the source, which actually begins \"Oh, ki, massa ...\", where ''ki'' is a phrase by itself:\n\n{{quote|In all other examples of this interjection that I have found, it is simply ''ki'' (once spelled ''kie''). As here, it expresses surprise, amusement, satisfaction, mild expostulation, and the like. It has nothing like the meaning of the adjective OK, which in the earliest recorded examples means 'all right, good,' though it later acquires other meanings, but even when used as an interjection does not express surprise, expostulation, or anything similar.{{sfn|Cassidy|1981}}}}\n\n==Variations==\nWhether this word is printed as OK, Ok, ok, okay, or O.K. is a matter normally resolved in the style manual for the publication involved. Dictionaries and style guides such as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' and ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' provide no consensus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2008/09/im-ok-youre-okay.html |title=I'm OK, you're okay |publisher=Grammarphobia |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Variation!!Where used/Origins\n|-\n|okeh|| Choctaw word for 'it is so' (see above).

Spanish speakers often spell the word \"okey\" to conform with the spelling rules of the language. In Brazil, it may be also pronounced as \"\u00f4-kei\". In Portugal, it is used with its Portuguese pronunciation and sounds something like \"\u00f3k\u00e2i\" (similar to the English pronunciation but with the \"\u00f3\" sounding like the \"o\" in \"lost\" or \"top\"), or even as 'oh-kapa', from the letters ''O'' ('\u00f3') and ''K'' ('capa'). In [[Spain]] it's much less common than in Latin American countries (words such as \"vale\" or \"de acuerdo\" are preferred) but it may still be heard.\n\nIn [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]], ''OK'' has become part of the everyday [[Dutch language|Dutch]] language. It is pronounced the same way.\n\n[[Arabic]] speakers also use the word (\u0623\u0648\u0643\u064a) widely, particularly in areas of former British presence like Egypt, Jordan, Israel/Palestine and [[Iraq]], but also all over the Arab world due to the prevalence of American cinema and television. It is pronounced just as it is in English but is very rarely seen in Arabic newspapers and formal media.\n\nIn [[Hebrew]], the word ''OK'' is common as an equivalent to the Hebrew word \u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 [b'seder] ('adequate', 'in order'). It is written as it sounds in English \u05d0\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05d9.\n\nIt is used in Japan and Korea in a somewhat restricted sense, fairly equivalent to \"all right\". ''OK'' is often used in colloquial Japanese as a replacement for \u5927\u4e08\u592b (daij\u014dbu \"all right\")\u3000or \u3044\u3044 (ii \"good\") and often followed by \u3067\u3059 (desu \u2013 the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]). A transliteration of the English word, written as \u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc (lit. \"\u014dk\u0113\") or \u30aa\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc (lit. \"okk\u0113\") is also often used in the same manner as the English, and is becoming more popular in recent years. In Korean, \uc624\ucf00\uc774 (literally \"okay\") can be used colloquially in place of \ub124 (ne, \"yes\") when expressing approval or acknowledgment.\n\nIn Chinese, the term {{Zh|c=\u597d|p=h\u01ceo| labels=no}} (literally: \"good\"), can be modified to fit most of usages of ''OK''. For example, {{zh|c=\u597d\u4e86|p=h\u01ceo le| labels=no}} closely resembles the [[interjection]] usage of ''OK''. The \"\u4e86\" indicates a change of state; in this case it indicates the achievement of consensus. Likewise, ''OK'' is commonly transformed into \"OK\u4e86\" (OK le) when communicating with foreigners or with fellow Cantonese speaking people in at least Hong Kong and possibly to an extent other regions of China.<ref>3 min 37 s video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSHziqJWYcM Youtube.com]</ref> Other usages of ''OK'' such as \"I am OK\" can be translated as {{zh|s=\u6211\u8fd8\u597d|p=w\u01d2 h\u00e1i h\u01ceo| labels=no}}. In Hong Kong, movies or dramas set in modern times use the term ''okay'' as part of the sprinkling of English included in otherwise Cantonese dialog.  In [[Mandarin Chinese]] it is also somewhat humorously used in the \"spelling\" of the word for karaoke, \"[[wikt:\u5361\u62c9OK|\u5361\u62c9OK]]\", pronounced \"kah-lah-oh-kei\" (Mandarin does not natively have a syllable with the pronunciation \"kei\"). On the computer, OK is usually translated as \"\u786e\u5b9a,\" which means \"confirm\" or \"confirmed\".\n\nIn [[Taiwan]], ''OK'' is frequently used in various sentences, popular among but not limited to younger generations. This includes the aforementioned \"OK\u4e86\" (Okay le), \"OK\u55ce\" (Okay ma), meaning \"Is it okay?\" or \"OK\u5566\" (Okay la), a strong, persuading affirmative, as well as the somewhat tongue-in-cheek explicit yes/no construction \"O\u4e0dOK\uff1f\" (O b\u00f9 OK?), \"Is it OK or not?\"\n\nIn [[Russia]], ''OK'' is used very frequently for any positive meaning. The word in Russian has many morphologies: \"\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439\", \"\u043e\u043a\u0435\u044e\u0448\u043a\u0438\", \"\u043e\u043a\", \"\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\", etc.\n\nIn [[France]] and [[Belgium]], ''OK'' is used to communicate agreement, and is generally followed by a French phrase (e.g. ''OK, d'accord'', \"Okay, chef\")  or another borrowing (e.g., ''OK, boss. ok, bye.''). Rarely pronounced /\u0254k/ these days, except by young children encountering dialog boxes for the first times.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]] \"okay lang\" is a common expression, literally meaning \"just okay\" or \"just fine\". Sometimes spelled as ''okey''.\n\nIn [[Malay language|Malay]], it is frequently used with the emphatic suffix \"lah\": OK-lah.\n\nIn [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], it is spelled \"\u00d4 k\u00ea\".\n\nIn [[India]], it is often used after a sentence to mean \"did you get it?\", often not regarded politely, for example, \"I want this job done, OK?\" or at the end of a conversation (mostly on the phone) followed by \"bye\" as in \"OK, bye.\"\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], ''OK'' is also used as a slogan of national television station [[RCTI]] since the year 1994.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], ''OK'' has become a part of Urdu and Punjabi languages.\n\nIn [[Germany]], ''OK'' is spelled as ''o.k.'' or ''O.K.'' or ''okay''. It may be pronounced as in English, but /\u0254\u02c8ke\u02d0/ or /o\u02c8ke\u02d0/ are also common.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/o__k_|title=Duden {{!}} o. k. {{!}} Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition, Herkunft|website=www.duden.de|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The meaning ranges from acknowledgement to describing something neither good nor bad, same as in US/UK usage.\n\nIn [[Maldivian language|Maldivian]] Okay is used in different ways, often used to agree with something, more often used while departing from a gathering \"Okay Dahnee/Kendee.\"\n\nIn [[Singapore]], ''OK'' is often used with suffixes used in \"[[Singlish]]\" such as ''OK lor'', ''OK lah'', ''OK meh'', ''OK leh'', which are used in different occasions.\n\n==Gesture==\n{{Main|OK gesture}}\n[[File:OK Sign.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Okay sign]]\nIn the United States and much of Europe a related [[gesture]] is made by touching the index finger with the thumb (forming a rough circle) and raising of the remaining fingers.<ref name=FGuide>Armstrong, Nancy & Melissa Wagner.

Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann \u2013 as he was known \u2013 sold the farm to Major Warden.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloemfonteinguide.co.za/about-bloemfontein/history/|title=History of Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa|newspaper=Bloemfontein Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121041821/http://www.bloemfonteinguide.co.za/about-bloemfontein/history/|archive-date=21 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWith colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the [[Orange River Sovereignty]] (1848\u201354) and eventually the [[Orange Free State]] Republic (1854\u20131902). From 1902\u201310 it served as the capital of the [[Orange River Colony]] and since that time as the provincial capital of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]]. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the [[Union of South Africa]].\n\n===Orange Free State (1854\u20131902)===\nThe [[Orange Free State]] was an independent [[Boere-Afrikaner|Boer]] sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers, its borders were determined by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the [[Orange River Sovereignty]], with a seat of a [[British Resident]] in Bloemfontein.\n\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich [[Griqualand|Griqua Land]] area.<ref>David Johnson, \"Griqua Land Claims in Southern Africa, 1874-1998\", in David L.

The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the [[South African Republic]]. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\n\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located [[Bloemfontein railway station|railway station]], and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\n\nOn 13 March 1900, following the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], British forces captured the city and built a [[Concentration camp (South Africa)|concentration camp]] nearby to house [[Boer]] women and children.

The policy was built on [[white supremacy]] and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights.<ref name=\"bloemfotein1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/bloemfontein-segregated-city|publisher=SA History Online| title=Bloemfontein the Segregated city|date=2011-03-30}}</ref> This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\n\nWhen the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government passed the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to [[Heidedal]]. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as [[Sotho people|Sotho]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung.<ref name=\"bloemfotein1\"/> [[Phahameng]], a [[Sotho people|Sotho]] township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.<ref name=\"bloemfotein2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/cultural-studies/review-of-apartheid-in-bloemfontein-verno-cultural-studies-essay.php|publisher=Uni Assignment| title=Review Of Apartheid In Bloemfontein Verno Cultural Studies Essay}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55&nbsp;km east ward expansion called [[Botshabelo]] was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to [[Thaba Nchu]] and Botshabelo.\n\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.<ref name=\"bloemfotein3\">{{cite web|url=https://impulscentrum.be/south_africa/mod4_fringe/lesson11.asp|publisher=Impuls centrum| title= Apartheid and housing in Mangaung and Botshabelo}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of [[Motheo District Municipality]]. The [[Motheo District Municipality]] was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n===Since 1994===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court Of Appeal]] (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\n==Government==\nFree State Provincial Government building\nBloemfontein forms part of the [[Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality]], which was upgraded from a [[Local Municipality (South Africa)|Local Municipality]] in 2011.\n\nThe Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional representation (MMP)]] system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives.

This road ends in an interchange with the N1.\n\nThere are also two two-digit R routes: the [[R64 road (South Africa)|R64]], which is the old road to Kimberley, via [[Dealesville]] and [[Boshof]]. It ends at the N1. The [[R30 road (South Africa)|R30]] ends at the N1 north of the town. It is the road to [[Welkom]].\n\nThree other three-digit R routes have their origin in Bloemfontein. The [[R706 road (South Africa)|R706]] takes origin from the N8 in the city centre, and heads south-east towards [[Jagersfontein]] and [[Fauresmith]]. The [[R702 road (South Africa)|R702]] also originates from the N8 in the city centre, but heads south-west towards the towns of [[Dewetsdorp]] and [[Wepener]]. The third road, the [[R700 road (South Africa)|R700]], starts south of the city centre from the M30 and heads north crossing the N8 and N1 towards [[Bultfontein]]\n\nBelow that level, Bloemfontein has a number of metropolitan or [[Metropolitan routes in Bloemfontein|M roads]]. These roads are numbered independently of m roads in other South African cities.\n\n===Rail===\n\nBloemfontein is well connected with rail. It is located on the most important rail junction between [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]], with daily trains to [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] and [[Johannesburg]].\n\n===Air===\nBloemfontein has two airports [[New Tempe Aerodrome]] and [[Bram Fischer International Airport]]. [[New Tempe Aerodrome]] has no scheduled flights, it is used as a training facility for aviators and schools. [[Bram Fischer International Airport]] has scheduled flights to all South Africa's major cities.\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nIn October 2016, the Mangaung Metropolitan and various taxi associations reached an agreement on the Integrated Public Transport system which is currently under construction.

Extending between the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers, its borders were determined by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the [[Orange River Sovereignty]], with a seat of a [[British Resident]] in Bloemfontein.\n\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich [[Griqualand|Griqua Land]] area.<ref>David Johnson, \"Griqua Land Claims in Southern Africa, 1874-1998\", in David L.

R. R. Tolkien]] was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left [[Orange Free State]] (now [[Free State (province)|Free State province]], South Africa) following the death of his father, [[Arthur Tolkien]], when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country\".<ref>Tolkien: \"though my earliest memories of are a hot country [...] I was shipped home [England] in 1895\".

The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the [[South African Republic]]. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\n\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located [[Bloemfontein railway station|railway station]], and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\n\nOn 13 March 1900, following the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], British forces captured the city and built a [[Concentration camp (South Africa)|concentration camp]] nearby to house [[Boer]] women and children. The [[National Women's Monument]], on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men<ref>{{cite book|page=31|title=The Concentration Camps, 1900\u20131902: Facts, Figures and Fables|author=Arthur Clive Martin|publisher=H.

The policy was built on [[white supremacy]] and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights.<ref name=\"bloemfotein1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/bloemfontein-segregated-city|publisher=SA History Online| title=Bloemfontein the Segregated city|date=2011-03-30}}</ref> This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.\n\nWhen the [[South Africa|South African]] [[apartheid]] government passed the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to [[Heidedal]]. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as [[Sotho people|Sotho]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung.<ref name=\"bloemfotein1\"/> [[Phahameng]], a [[Sotho people|Sotho]] township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.<ref name=\"bloemfotein2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/cultural-studies/review-of-apartheid-in-bloemfontein-verno-cultural-studies-essay.php|publisher=Uni Assignment| title=Review Of Apartheid In Bloemfontein Verno Cultural Studies Essay}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55km east ward expansion called [[Botshabelo]] was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to [[Thaba Nchu]] and Botshabelo.\n\nBotshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.<ref name=\"bloemfotein3\">{{cite web|url=https://impulscentrum.be/south_africa/mod4_fringe/lesson11.asp|publisher=Impuls centrum| title= Apartheid and housing in Mangaung and Botshabelo}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of [[Motheo District Municipality]]. The [[Motheo District Municipality]] was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.\n\n===Since 1994===\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court Of Appeal]] (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\n==Government==\nFree State Provincial Government building\nBloemfontein forms part of the [[Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality]], which was upgraded from a [[Local Municipality (South Africa)|Local Municipality]] in 2011.\n\nThe Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional representation (MMP)]] system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, Olly Mlamleli, was elected in August 2016.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{climate chart\n|Bloemfontein\n|15 |31 |83\n|15 |29 |111\n|12 |27 |72\n|8  |23 |56\n|3  |20 |17\n|\u22122 |17 |12\n|\u22122 |17 |8\n|1  |20 |15\n|5  |24 |24\n|9  |26 |43\n|12 |28 |58\n|14 |30 |60\n|float  = right\n|clear  = right\n|source = SAWS<ref name=\"saws-climstats\"/>\n}}\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the [[Highveld]] at an elevation of {{Convert|1400|m|ft}}, bordering on the semi-arid region of the [[Karoo]].

From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: \"If you crave joys, tumble some boys.\"<ref>Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

For example, the French would call \"homosexuality\" the \"Italian vice\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the \"English vice\" in the 18th century, the ''m\u0153urs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the \"German vice\" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.<ref>Revenin, ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et prostitution masculines \u00e0 Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.\n\n==Modern Europe==\n[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|right|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on the [[third sex]] and against [[\u00a7175]] - a copy from the library of the [[Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee]], confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''\"Destined [[Nazi book burnings|for destruction]] in accordance with the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|Reichspresident]]'s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28 February 1933]]!\"'' and hidden from the public (label \"Secr.\") as [[Nazi plunder]] at the [[Prussian State Library]].]]\n\n===Psychology and terminology shifts===\nThe developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since the 1790s with Johann Valentin M\u00fcller's work.<ref>Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref> The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of \"criminals,\" looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify \"pederasts\" affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152.</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Charles's expos\u00e9, ''Les Deux Prostitutions: \u00e9tudes du pathologie sociale'', (\"The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology\") developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 publication, ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', was the most widely translated work of this kind.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Krafft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nDegeneracy became a widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th century. [[Benedict Augustin Morel]] is considered the father of degeneracy theory.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology's inquisition into homosexuality.  \"Contrary sexual feeling,\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> as Westphal's phrased, and the word \"homosexual\" itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term \"sodomy\" and the elusive \"abomination.\"  As Michel Foucault phrases, \"the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of \"gay and lesbian\" every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. Non-heterosexuals such as bisexual people and those who are transgender have also been classed alongside gay people and lesbians, resulting in the popular LGBT acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender). However, the acronym is not set in stone; it has sometimes appeared as LGBTQ (to include [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning or queer people]]).\n\n===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===\n{{main|Timeline of LGBT history in Britain}}\n\nVarious authors wrote on the topic of homosexuality.

A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?\u2014circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down.

It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international LGBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]].

Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. \"anti-social\".\n\n===Alan Turing===\nIn Britain, the view of homosexuality as the mark of a deviant mind was not limited to the psychiatric wards of hospitals but also the courts. An extremely famous case was that of [[Alan Turing]], a British mathematician and theoretician. During WWII, Turing worked at [[Bletchley Park]] and was one of the major architects of the [[Colossus computer]], designed to break the Enigma codes of the Nazi war machine. For the success of this, he received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18541715|title=I remember Alan Turing...|date=June 23, 2012|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In spite of all his brilliance and the services rendered to his country, Turing was also openly homosexual and in the early 1950s this fact came to the attention of the British government when he was arrested under section 11 of an [[Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885|1885 statute]] of \"gross indecency\".<ref>Leavitt, David (2007). The man who knew too much: Alan Turing and the invention of the computer. Phoenix. {{ISBN|978-0-7538-2200-5}}.</ref> At the time there was great fear that Turing's sexuality could be exploited by Soviet spies, and so he was sentenced to choosing between jail and injections of synthetic estrogen.  The choice of the latter lead him to massive depression and committing suicide at the age of 41, biting into a poisoned apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/alan-turings-apple|title=Alan Turing's Apple|first=Amy Davidson|last=Sorkin|date=August 10, 2011|via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref> It is estimated that an additional 50\u201375,000 men were persecuted under this law, with only partial repeal taking place in 1967 and the final measure of it in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/the-mistake-behind-the-posthumous-pardon-of-alan-turing/|title=The Mistake Behind The Posthumous Pardon Of Alan Turing|first=Tamara|last=Tabo}}</ref>\n\n==United States of America==\n{{main|LGBT history in the United States}}\n{{See also|History of bisexuals in the United States|History of gay men in the United States|History of lesbianism in the United States|History of transgender people in the United States}}\n\n===18th and 19th century===\nBefore the American Civil War and the massive population growth of the Post-Civil War America, the majority of the American population was rural. Homosexuality remained an unseen and taboo concept in society, and the word \"homosexuality\" was not coined until 1868 by German-Hungarian [[Karoly Maria Kertbeny]] (who advocated decriminalization).<ref>EEdsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref> During this era, homosexuality fell under the umbrella term \"sodomy\" that comprised all forms of nonproductive sexuality (masturbation and oral sex were sometimes excluded). Without urban sub-cultures or a name for self-definition, group identification and self-consciousness was unlikely.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref>\n\nMainstream [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]] of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26-7|KJV}} and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] were the justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of \"sodomy.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the English laws of \"buggery,\" and the punishment in all American colonies was death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nPennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for \"sodomy\" in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, legal language shifted away from that of damnation to more dispassionate terms like \"unmentionable\" or \"abominable\" acts.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Aside from sodomy and \"attempted sodomy\" court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality was seen as peripheral in mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely given Victorian notions of female sexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nA survey of sodomy law enforcement during the nineteenth century suggests that a significant minority of cases did not specify the gender of the \"victim\" or accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\">Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 117\u2013128. 2008</ref> The first prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until 1880.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In response to increasing visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure was introduced across the United States. \"Sodomy\" laws also shifted in many states over the beginning of the twentieth century to address homosexuality specifically (many states during the twentieth century made heterosexual anal intercourse legal).<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In some states, these laws would last until they were repealed by the Supreme Court in 2003 with the Lawrence decision.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/>\n\n===Male ideal and the 19th century===\nHomosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, \"a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy's boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. \u2013 fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nNew York, as America's largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800\u201320 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He was immediately drawn to young working-class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014\"frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\" or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014\"I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[We'wha]] (1849\u20131896) was a notable [[Zuni]] weaver, potter and ''[[lhamana]]''. Raised as a boy, they would later spend part of their life dressing and living in the roles usually filled by women in Zuni culture, later living and working in roles filled by men, changing depending on the situation. Anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], a friend of We'wha's who wrote extensively about the Zuni, hosted We'wha and the Zuni delegation when We'wha was chosen as an official emissary to Washington D.C. in 1886. During this time [[Singular they|they]] met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had at least one husband, was trained in the customs and rites for the ceremonies for both men and women, and was a respected member of their community. Friends who documented their life used both pronouns for We'wha.<ref name=Bost139>Suzanne Bost, ''Mulattas and Mestizas: Representing Mixed Identities in the Americas'', 1850-2000, (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2003), pg.139</ref><ref name=Stevenson37>Matilda Coxe Stevenson, ''The Zuni Indians: Their Mythology, Esoteric Fraternities, and Ceremonies'', (BiblioBazaar, 2010) p.&nbsp;37 Quote:\"the most intelligent person in the pueblo. Strong character made his word law among both men and women with whom he associated. Though his wrath was dreaded by men as well as women, he was loved by all children, to whom he was ever kind\"</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1908, the first American defense of homosexuality was published.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> This 600-page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson's view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing's, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels\u2014''Imre: A Memorandum''.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90\u201391.</ref> He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to \"cure\" him.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/> Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely \"spiritual,\" but could not escape the \"animal.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/>\n\nBy this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In an 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York's queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. \"Middle class queer,\" \"fairies,\" were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> But with this growing public presence, backlash occurred. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman's praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.\n\n===1920s===\n[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]\n\nThe 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\"<ref>The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in [[Hugh J. Ward]]'s production of the musical ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''.</ref> It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:<ref>Artists who recorded this song include: 1.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \"pansy clubs\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].<ref>Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star.

'' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12\u201313, 80\u201383.</ref> In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.\n\n===Late 1930s===\nBy 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and mores, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

The war effort greatly shifted American culture and by extension representations in entertainment of both the [[nuclear family]] and LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, WWII [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in [[reform]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n===Stonewall riots===\n{{Main|Stonewall riots}}\n\nAlthough the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are generally considered the starting point of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the LGBT community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power. ''See: [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots]]''\n\nIn the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], [[Craig Rodwell]] president and vice president respectively of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and Mattachine activist John Timmons staged the Sip-In at [[Julius (restaurant)|Julius' Bar]] on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens, transsexuals, and butch lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980s===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe 1980s in LGBT history are marked with the emergence of [[HIV]]. During the early period of the outbreak of HIV, the [[HIV and men who have sex with men|epidemic of HIV was commonly linked to gay men.]]\n\nIn the 1980s a renewed conservative movement spawned a new anti-gay movement in the United States, particularly with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). While it is a common belief within some circles of the LGBT community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were anti-gay, some others believe that this is an exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who \"advocated\" homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexuals. Robert G. Kaiser's news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.\n\"The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,\" Kaiser wrote. \"Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans' private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party\u2014a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Murdock |first=Deroy |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: |title=The Gay Left Lies about Reagan \u2014 Again |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> However, by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gays as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also, despite the more conservative period, life in general for gays and lesbians was considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.\n \nTestifying to improved conditions, a 1991 [[Wall Street Journal]] survey found that homosexuals, in comparison with average Americans, were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, with average salaries $30,000 higher than the norm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&pg=PA139 \"The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom\"], Michael Bronski.

Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples not married, in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nThe first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. {{as of|2019|June}}, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in twenty-six countries: the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (without [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]\u2014May 22, 2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2014), [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]] (2015),  [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2018) and in [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2019).

In 1990, a student group named The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first LGBT organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recognition as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn April 2016, the GSA Network changed their name from Gay-Straight Alliance Network to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network in order to be more inclusive and reflective of youth who make up the organization.\n\n==Historical study of homosexuality==\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\nWhen [[Heinrich H\u00f6ssli]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|K. H. Ulrichs]] began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.<ref>''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, {{ISBN|0-8153-3354-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3354-8}}, Taylor & Francis, 2000, page 388.</ref> Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In Germany, [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nAs part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result, much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''Annales''. Although several useful syntheses of the world [[history of homosexuality]] have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.<ref>Ed.

From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: \"If you crave joys, tumble some boys.\"<ref>Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

For example, the French would call \"homosexuality\" the \"Italian vice\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the \"English vice\" in the 18th century, the ''m\u0153urs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the \"German vice\" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.<ref>Revenin, ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et prostitution masculines \u00e0 Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.\n\n==Modern Europe==\n[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|right|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on the [[third sex]] and against [[\u00a7175]] - a copy from the library of the [[Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee]], confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''\"Destined [[Nazi book burnings|for destruction]] in accordance with the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|Reichspresident]]'s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28 February 1933]]!\"'' and hidden from the public (label \"Secr.\") as [[Nazi plunder]] at the [[Prussian State Library]].]]\n\n===Psychology and terminology shifts===\nThe developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since the 1790s with Johann Valentin M\u00fcller's work.<ref>Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref> The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of \"criminals,\" looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify \"pederasts\" affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152.</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Charles's expos\u00e9, ''Les Deux Prostitutions: \u00e9tudes du pathologie sociale'', (\"The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology\") developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 publication, ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', was the most widely translated work of this kind.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Krafft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nDegeneracy became a widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th century. [[Benedict Augustin Morel]] is considered the father of degeneracy theory.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology's inquisition into homosexuality.  \"Contrary sexual feeling,\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> as Westphal's phrased, and the word \"homosexual\" itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term \"sodomy\" and the elusive \"abomination.\"  As Michel Foucault phrases, \"the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of \"gay and lesbian\" every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. Non-heterosexuals such as bisexual people and those who are transgender have also been classed alongside gay people and lesbians, resulting in the popular LGBT acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender). However, the acronym is not set in stone; it has sometimes appeared as LGBTQ (to include [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning or queer people]]).\n\n===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===\n{{main|Timeline of LGBT history in Britain}}\n\nVarious authors wrote on the topic of homosexuality.

A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?\u2014circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] decried cultural degeneration, [[prostitution]] and [[syphilis]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews.\n\n[[Berlin]] also had the most active [[LGBT movements|LGBT rights movements]] in the world at the time. Jewish doctor [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] had co-founded the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious \"[[Paragraph 175]]\" of the Penal Code that made [[Men who have sex with men|sex between men]] illegal. It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international LGBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]]. It had a [[research library]] and a large archive, and included a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer worldwide in the call for [[civil rights]] and social acceptance for homosexual and transgender people.\nAs a  leading city for homosexuals during the 1920, Berlin had  clubs and even newspapers for both lesbians and gay men. The lesbian magazine [[Die Freundin]] was started by [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] and the gay men's magazine ''[[Der Eigene]]'' had already started in 1896 as the world's first gay magazine.

Conditions for gay men in the camps were especially rough; they faced not only persecution from German soldiers, but also other prisoners, and many gay men were reported to die of beatings. Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. \"anti-social\".\n\n===Alan Turing===\nIn Britain, the view of homosexuality as the mark of a deviant mind was not limited to the psychiatric wards of hospitals but also the courts. An extremely famous case was that of [[Alan Turing]], a British mathematician and theoretician.

For the success of this, he received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18541715|title=I remember Alan Turing...|date=June 23, 2012|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In spite of all his brilliance and the services rendered to his country, Turing was also openly homosexual and in the early 1950s this fact came to the attention of the British government when he was arrested under section 11 of an [[Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885|1885 statute]] of \"gross indecency\".<ref>Leavitt, David (2007).

Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref>\n\nMainstream [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]] of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26-7|KJV}} and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] were the justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of \"sodomy.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the English laws of \"buggery,\" and the punishment in all American colonies was death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nPennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for \"sodomy\" in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, legal language shifted away from that of damnation to more dispassionate terms like \"unmentionable\" or \"abominable\" acts.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Aside from sodomy and \"attempted sodomy\" court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality was seen as peripheral in mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely given Victorian notions of female sexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nA survey of sodomy law enforcement during the nineteenth century suggests that a significant minority of cases did not specify the gender of the \"victim\" or accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\">Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 117\u2013128. 2008</ref> The first prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until 1880.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In response to increasing visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure was introduced across the United States. \"Sodomy\" laws also shifted in many states over the beginning of the twentieth century to address homosexuality specifically (many states during the twentieth century made heterosexual anal intercourse legal).<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In some states, these laws would last until they were repealed by the Supreme Court in 2003 with the Lawrence decision.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/>\n\n===Male ideal and the 19th century===\nHomosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, \"a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy's boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. \u2013 fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nNew York, as America's largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800\u201320 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He was immediately drawn to young working-class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014\"frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\" or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014\"I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[We'wha]] (1849\u20131896) was a notable [[Zuni]] weaver, potter and ''[[lhamana]]''. Raised as a boy, they would later spend part of their life dressing and living in the roles usually filled by women in Zuni culture, later living and working in roles filled by men, changing depending on the situation. Anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], a friend of We'wha's who wrote extensively about the Zuni, hosted We'wha and the Zuni delegation when We'wha was chosen as an official emissary to Washington D.C. in 1886. During this time [[Singular they|they]] met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had at least one husband, was trained in the customs and rites for the ceremonies for both men and women, and was a respected member of their community. Friends who documented their life used both pronouns for We'wha.<ref name=Bost139>Suzanne Bost, ''Mulattas and Mestizas: Representing Mixed Identities in the Americas'', 1850-2000, (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2003), pg.139</ref><ref name=Stevenson37>Matilda Coxe Stevenson, ''The Zuni Indians: Their Mythology, Esoteric Fraternities, and Ceremonies'', (BiblioBazaar, 2010) p.&nbsp;37 Quote:\"the most intelligent person in the pueblo. Strong character made his word law among both men and women with whom he associated. Though his wrath was dreaded by men as well as women, he was loved by all children, to whom he was ever kind\"</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1908, the first American defense of homosexuality was published.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> This 600-page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson's view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing's, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels\u2014''Imre: A Memorandum''.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90\u201391.</ref> He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to \"cure\" him.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/> Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely \"spiritual,\" but could not escape the \"animal.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/>\n\nBy this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In an 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York's queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. \"Middle class queer,\" \"fairies,\" were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> But with this growing public presence, backlash occurred. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman's praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.\n\n===1920s===\n[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]\n\nThe 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\"<ref>The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in [[Hugh J. Ward]]'s production of the musical ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''.</ref> It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:<ref>Artists who recorded this song include: 1.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \"pansy clubs\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].<ref>Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star.

'' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12\u201313, 80\u201383.</ref> In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.\n\n===Late 1930s===\nBy 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and mores, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

The war effort greatly shifted American culture and by extension representations in entertainment of both the [[nuclear family]] and LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, WWII [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in [[reform]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n===Stonewall riots===\n{{Main|Stonewall riots}}\n\nAlthough the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are generally considered the starting point of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the LGBT community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power. ''See: [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots]]''\n\nIn the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], [[Craig Rodwell]] president and vice president respectively of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and Mattachine activist John Timmons staged the Sip-In at [[Julius (restaurant)|Julius' Bar]] on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens, transsexuals, and butch lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980s===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe 1980s in LGBT history are marked with the emergence of [[HIV]]. During the early period of the outbreak of HIV, the [[HIV and men who have sex with men|epidemic of HIV was commonly linked to gay men.]]\n\nIn the 1980s a renewed conservative movement spawned a new anti-gay movement in the United States, particularly with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). While it is a common belief within some circles of the LGBT community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were anti-gay, some others believe that this is an exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who \"advocated\" homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexuals. Robert G. Kaiser's news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.\n\"The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,\" Kaiser wrote. \"Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans' private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party\u2014a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Murdock |first=Deroy |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: |title=The Gay Left Lies about Reagan \u2014 Again |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> However, by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gays as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also, despite the more conservative period, life in general for gays and lesbians was considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.\n \nTestifying to improved conditions, a 1991 [[Wall Street Journal]] survey found that homosexuals, in comparison with average Americans, were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, with average salaries $30,000 higher than the norm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&pg=PA139 \"The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom\"], Michael Bronski.

Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples not married, in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nThe first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. {{as of|2019|June}}, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in twenty-six countries: the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (without [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]\u2014May 22, 2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2014), [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]] (2015),  [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2018) and in [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2019). In [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Mexico|Mexico]], same-sex marriage is recognized in all states, but performed only in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]], where it became effective on March 4, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | author=Carlos \u00c1viles Allende | publisher=El Universal | title=Ratifica corte, bodas gay, v\u00e1lidas en todo el pa\u00eds | date=August 10, 2010 | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/700789.html | accessdate=September 23, 2010|language=es}}</ref><ref name=\"Gay marriage effective\">{{cite web | last=Archundia | first=M\u00f3nica | publisher=El Universal | title=La primera uni\u00f3n gay, para marzo | date=January 5, 2010 | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/99607.html | accessdate=January 5, 2010|language=es}}</ref>\n\nSame-sex marriage was effectively legalized in the United States on June 26, 2015 following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Obergefell v.

Windsor]]''.\n\n==Student groups==\n{{Main|Gay\u2013straight alliance}}\n\nSince the mid-1970s students at high schools and universities have organized LGBT groups, often called Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) at their respective schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/news/release2.cfx?id=279|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213233143/http://www.amsa.org/news/release2.cfx?id=279|url-status=dead|publisher=American Medical Student Association |date=September 13, 2006 |title=Nation's Medical Students Applaud California Osteopathic Medical School's Affirmation of Gay-Straight Alliance |archivedate=February 13, 2009}}</ref> The groups form to provide support for LGBT students and to promote awareness of LGBT issues in the local community. In 1990, a student group named The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first LGBT organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recognition as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn April 2016, the GSA Network changed their name from Gay-Straight Alliance Network to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network in order to be more inclusive and reflective of youth who make up the organization.\n\n==Historical study of homosexuality==\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\nWhen [[Heinrich H\u00f6ssli]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|K. H. Ulrichs]] began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.<ref>''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, {{ISBN|0-8153-3354-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3354-8}}, Taylor & Francis, 2000, page 388.</ref> Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In Germany, [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nAs part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result, much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''Annales''. Although several useful syntheses of the world [[history of homosexuality]] have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.<ref>Ed.

The reason given by him for breaking away from the Shiv Sena was that the latter was \"run by petty clerks\" because of which it had \"fallen from its former glory\".  Also, Thackeray declared his motive of building a political awareness for the development related issues of the state and giving them a center stage in national politics.\n\nAt the time of the party's foundation, Raj Thackeray stated that he does not want to have hostilities with his uncle who \"was, is and always will be (his) mentor\".\n\nAlthough the MNS is a break-away group from the Shiv Sena, the party is still based on [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and ''Bhumiputra'' ideologies.

In the frenzy for reinstatement that followed numerous political parties took the stand for the probationers\u2019 cause. First the MNS and the SS came in, then the established national parties, the Congress and the BJP. Even the [[CPI M]], rallied in support of the laid off Kolkata employees.\n\nOne day after the lay off, the retrenched former staff flocked to the MNS office, even though the SS labour arm, the [[Bharatiya Kamgar Sena]] generally rules the aviation unions.  The MNS then led more than 300 former employees to Jet's office in Marol. MNS general secretary [[Nitin Sardesai]] said, \"We met Jet officials today while a lot of (cabin) crew and MNS workers were protesting outside. While we were talking, Jet chairman Naresh Goyal telephoned Raj Thackeray... He requested us to end the protest and offered to meet Raj in a couple of days. We had an one-point agenda that those laid off should be taken back.\"\n\nIn two days the MNS march and support got the staff re-hired. The media widely appeared to pronounce Raj as having won the game of one upmanship with the SS, whose mantle of aggressive street politics was seen as having been usurped. This was a big boost for the MNS' newly formed trade union, the [[Maharashtra Navnirman Kamgar Sena]], which has been trying to cut into the SS' influence in the aviation, hotel and entertainment sectors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081017/jsp/nation/story_9979112.jsp |title= Raj steals Sena thunder |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-26 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> \n\n==Elected representatives==\nPerformance in the [[2012 Maharashtra municipal elections]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:black; color:#f93; text-align:left;\"|Municipal Corporation\n! style=\"background:black; color:#f93; text-align:right;\"|Elected (Out of) 2012\n! style=\"background:black; color:#f93; text-align:right;\"|Elected (Out of) 2017\n|-\n|[[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|27 (227)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|01 (227)\n|-\n|[[Thane Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|7 (130)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|0 (130)\n|-\n|[[Kalyan-Dombivali Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|26 (107) 2010\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|10 (107) 2015\n|-\n|[[Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (78)\n|0 (78)\n|-\n|[[Pune Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|29 (152)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|02 (162)\n|-\n|[[Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|4 (128)\n|1(128)\n|-\n|[[Nashik Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"background:#f93; text-align:right;\"|40 (122)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|05 (122)\n|-\n|[[Akola Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (73)\n|0 (73)\n|-\n|[[Amravati Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (87)\n|-\n|[[Nagpur Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|2 (145)\n|-\n|[[Malegaon Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|2 (31)\n|-\n|[[Jalgaon Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|12 (75)\n|-\n|[[Palghar Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|0 (12)\n|-\n|[[Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|4 (68)\n|-\n|[[Chandrapur Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (66)\n|-\n|[[Sangli-Miraj & Kupwad|Sangli-Miraj & Kupwadunicipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|2 (?)\n|-\n|[[Wani Municipal Council]]\n| style=\"background:#f93; text-align:right;\"|8 (16)\n|-\n|[[Khed Municipal Council]]\n| style=\"background:#f93; text-align:right;\"|9 (16)\n|-\n|colspan=2|<center>'''''Source:''''' ''MahaSEC''<ref name=\"Sena's hat-trick in BMC; Congress suffers setback\">{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AsTha_h2wXTSdGJOM3lBaGdPamkwalVIaHJtOEZ4Z0E&gid=0|title=State Election Commission Maharashtra|accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref></center>\n|}\n\nMNS won 13 assembly seats (out of 288) in the 2009 assembly elections Maharashtra.

Other MP's also demanded the invocation of Article 355 in the light of the attacks. Shahnawaz Hussain of the BJP made such demands in asking if people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh needed a permit to travel to other parts of the country. The [[CPI M]]'s Mohammed Salim said that such incidents threaten the country's integrity and send a wrong signal to the rest of the country.

In the frenzy for reinstatement that followed numerous political parties took the stand for the probationers\u2019 cause. First the MNS and the SS came in, then the established national parties, the Congress and the BJP. Even the [[CPI M]], rallied in support of the laid off Kolkata employees.\n\nOne day after the lay off, the retrenched former staff flocked to the MNS office, even though the SS labour arm, the [[Bharatiya Kamgar Sena]] generally rules the aviation unions.  The MNS then led more than 300 former employees to Jet's office in Marol. MNS general secretary [[Nitin Sardesai]] said, \"We met Jet officials today while a lot of (cabin) crew and MNS workers were protesting outside. While we were talking, Jet chairman Naresh Goyal telephoned Raj Thackeray... He requested us to end the protest and offered to meet Raj in a couple of days. We had an one-point agenda that those laid off should be taken back.\"\n\nIn two days the MNS march and support got the staff re-hired. The media widely appeared to pronounce Raj as having won the game of one upmanship with the SS, whose mantle of aggressive street politics was seen as having been usurped. This was a big boost for the MNS' newly formed trade union, the [[Maharashtra Navnirman Kamgar Sena]], which has been trying to cut into the SS' influence in the aviation, hotel and entertainment sectors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081017/jsp/nation/story_9979112.jsp |title= Raj steals Sena thunder |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-26 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> \n\n==Elected representatives==\nPerformance in the [[2012 Maharashtra municipal elections]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:black; color:#f93; text-align:left;\"|Municipal Corporation\n! style=\"background:black; color:#f93; text-align:right;\"|Elected (Out of) 2012\n! style=\"background:black; color:#f93; text-align:right;\"|Elected (Out of) 2017\n|-\n|[[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|27 (227)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|01 (227)\n|-\n|[[Thane Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|7 (130)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|0 (130)\n|-\n|[[Kalyan-Dombivali Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|26 (107) 2010\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|10 (107) 2015\n|-\n|[[Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (78)\n|0 (78)\n|-\n|[[Pune Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|29 (152)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|02 (162)\n|-\n|[[Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|4 (128)\n|1(128)\n|-\n|[[Nashik Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"background:#f93; text-align:right;\"|40 (122)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|05 (122)\n|-\n|[[Akola Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (73)\n|0 (73)\n|-\n|[[Amravati Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (87)\n|-\n|[[Nagpur Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|2 (145)\n|-\n|[[Malegaon Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|2 (31)\n|-\n|[[Jalgaon Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|12 (75)\n|-\n|[[Palghar Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|0 (12)\n|-\n|[[Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|4 (68)\n|-\n|[[Chandrapur Municipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|1 (66)\n|-\n|[[Sangli-Miraj & Kupwad|Sangli-Miraj & Kupwadunicipal Corporation]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|2 (?)\n|-\n|[[Wani Municipal Council]]\n| style=\"background:#f93; text-align:right;\"|8 (16)\n|-\n|[[Khed Municipal Council]]\n| style=\"background:#f93; text-align:right;\"|9 (16)\n|-\n|colspan=2|<center>'''''Source:''''' ''MahaSEC''<ref name=\"Sena's hat-trick in BMC; Congress suffers setback\">{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AsTha_h2wXTSdGJOM3lBaGdPamkwalVIaHJtOEZ4Z0E&gid=0|title=State Election Commission Maharashtra|accessdate=2012-02-17}}</ref></center>\n|}\n\nMNS won 13 assembly seats (out of 288) in the 2009 assembly elections Maharashtra.

He noted that despite the attacks, the Maharashtra chief minister has maintained a silence on the issue, adding that such actions threaten the unity and integrity of the country. Other MP's also demanded the invocation of Article 355 in the light of the attacks. Shahnawaz Hussain of the BJP made such demands in asking if people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh needed a permit to travel to other parts of the country. The [[CPI M]]'s Mohammed Salim said that such incidents threaten the country's integrity and send a wrong signal to the rest of the country.
