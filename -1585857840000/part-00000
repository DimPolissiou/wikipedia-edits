relation to habitability==\nAlthough the ESI does not characterize [[planetary habitability|habitability]], given the point of reference is the Earth, some of its functions match those used by habitability measures. As with the definition of the [[habitable zone]], the ESI uses surface temperature as a primary function (and the terrestrial point of reference).  A 2016 article uses ESI as a target selection scheme and obtains results showing that the ESI has little relation to the habitability of an exoplanet, as it takes no account of the [[Flare star|activity of the star]], planetary [[tidal locking]], nor the planet's [[magnetosphere|magnetic field]] (i.e. ability to protect itself) which are among the keys to habitable surface conditions.<ref name=\"Armstrong\">{{cite journal |title=The host stars of Kepler's habitable exoplanets: superflares, rotation and activity |author=Armstrong, D.

All planets except the Earth are artists' conceptions.]] \nThe classification of exoplanets is difficult in that many methods of exoplanet detection leave several features unknown. For example, with the [[transit method]], one of the more successful measurement of radius can be highly accurate, but mass and density are often estimated. Likewise with [[radial velocity]] methods, which can provide accurate measurements of mass but are less successful measuring radius. Planets observed via a number of different methods therefore can be most accurately compared to Earth.\n\n==Similarity of non-planets to Earth==\n\n[[File:Io, Earth & Moon size comparison.jpg|thumb|The Moon, Io and Earth shown to scale. Although significantly smaller, some of the Solar System's moons and dwarf planets share similarities to Earth's density and temperature.]]\nThe index can be calculated for objects other than planets, including [[natural satellite]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s. The lower average density and temperature of these objects give them lower index values.

some of its functions match those used by habitability measures. As with the definition of the [[habitable zone]], the ESI uses surface temperature as a primary function (and the terrestrial point of reference).  A 2016 article uses ESI as a target selection scheme and obtains results showing that the ESI has little relation to the habitability of an exoplanet, as it takes no account of the [[Flare star|activity of the star]], planetary [[tidal locking]], nor the planet's [[magnetosphere|magnetic field]] (i.e. ability to protect itself) which are among the keys to habitable surface conditions.<ref name=\"Armstrong\">{{cite journal |title=The host stars of Kepler's habitable exoplanets: superflares, rotation and activity |author=Armstrong, D.

For example, with the [[transit method]], one of the more successful measurement of radius can be highly accurate, but mass and density are often estimated. Likewise with [[radial velocity]] methods, which can provide accurate measurements of mass but are less successful measuring radius. Planets observed via a number of different methods therefore can be most accurately compared to Earth.\n\n==Similarity of non-planets to Earth==\n\n[[File:Io, Earth & Moon size comparison.jpg|thumb|The Moon, Io and Earth shown to scale.
