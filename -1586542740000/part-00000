It includes any handheld electronic device that is specifically designed for audio translation. It also includes any [[machine translation]] service or [[software application]] for hand-held devices, including [[mobile telephones]], [[Pocket PC]]s, and [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s. Mobile translation provides hand-held device users with the advantage of instantaneous and non-mediated translation from one human language to another, usually against a service fee that is, nevertheless, significantly smaller than a human translator charges.\n\nMobile translation is part of the new range of services offered to \nmobile communication users, including location positioning ([[GPS]] \nservice), [[e-wallet]] (mobile banking), business card/bar-code/text \nscanning etc.\n\nIt relies on computer programming in the sphere of computational linguistics and the device's \ncommunication means (Internet connection or [[SMS]]) to work.\n\n== History ==\nA translation system allowing the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] to \nexchange conversations with foreign nationals through [[mobile phone]]s \nwas first developed in 1999 by the Advanced \nTelecommunications Research Institute International-Interpreting \nTelecommunications Research Laboratories, based in Kansai Science City, \n[[Japan]].

Among the early projects were the Spanish study programs which included vocabulary practice, quizzes, and word and phrase translations. Soon after, projects were developed using mobile phones to teach English at a Japanese university. By 2005, they shifted their focus to providing vocabulary instruction by SMS. A similar program was \ncreated for learning Italian in Australia. Vocabulary phrases, quizzes, and short sentences were sent via SMS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://llt.msu.edu/vol10num1/emerging/default.html |title=LLT Vol 10 Num 1: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES Going to the MALL: Mobile Assisted Language Learning |website=Llt.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\n===Current technology===\n[[Google Translate]] is one of the most highly-utilized translation services. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

We've been promised this before] BY IAN SHERR, OCTOBER 4, 2017</ref>\n\n==Technical functions==\nIn order to support the machine translation service, a mobile device needs to be able to communicate with external computers (servers) that receive the user-input text/speech, translate it and send it back to the user. This is usually done via an Internet connection ([[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[GPRS]], [[EDGE]], [[UMTS]], [[Wi-Fi]]) but some earlier applications used SMS to communicate with the translation server.\n\nMobile translation is not to be confused for the user-editable (talking) dictionaries and phrase books that are already widespread and available for many hand-held devices and do not normally require internet connectivity on the mobile device.\n\n===Features===\nMobile translation may include a number of useful features, auxiliary to text translation which forms the basis of the service. While the user can input text using the device keyboard, they can also use pre-existing text in the form of email or SMS messages received on the user's device (email/SMS translation). It is also possible to send a translated message, optionally containing the source text as well as the translation.\n\nSome mobile translation applications also offer additional services that further facilitate the translated communication process, such as:\n* speech generation ([[speech synthesis]]), where the (translated) text \nmay be transformed into human speech (by a computer that renders the \nvoice of a native speaker of the target language);\n* [[speech recognition]], where the user may talk to the device which \nwill record the speech and send it to the translation server to convert \ninto text before translating it;\n* [[image translation]], where the user can take a picture (using the \ndevice camera) of some printed text (a road sign, a restaurant menu, a \npage of a book etc.), have the application send it to the translation \nserver which will apply [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) \ntechnology, extract the text, return it to the user for editing (if \nnecessary) and then translate it into the chosen language.\n* voice interpreting, where the user can select the required language \ncombination and then get connected automatically to a live interpreter.\n\n===Supported languages===\nRecently, there has been a notable increase of the number of language \npairs offered for automatic translation on mobile devices. While \nJapanese service providers traditionally offer cross-translation for \nJapanese, Chinese, English and Korean, others may offer translation from and into over 20 languages, or over 200 language pairs, including most Latin languages.\n\nSpeech generation is, however, limited to a smaller portion of the above, including English, Spanish, Italian, French, Chinese etc. Image translation depends on the OCR languages available.\n\n==Technological benefits and constraints==\n===Advantages===\nHaving portable real-time automated translation at one's disposal has a \nnumber of practical uses and advantages.\n\n* Mobilizing Human Translation: human translators can use mobile translation tools to translate wherever and whenever. Human translators no longer have to work with desktop translation software. \n* Travelling: Real time mobile translation can help people travelling to a foreign country to make themselves understood or understand others.\n* [[Business networking]]: Conducting discussions with (potential) foreign customers using mobile translation saves time and finances, and is instantaneous. Real time mobile translation is a much lower cost alternative to multilingual call centres using human translators. Networking within multinational teams may also be greatly facilitated using the service.\n* Globalization of [[Social Networking]]: Mobile translation allows chatting and text messaging with friends at an international level. New friends and associates could be made by overcoming the language barrier.\n* Learning a foreign language: Learning a foreign language can be made easier and less expensive using a mobile device equipped with real time machine translation. Statistics reveal that most college students own mobile phones and find that learning a foreign language via mobile phone proves to be cheaper than on a [[Personal computer|PC]]. Furthermore, the portability of mobile phones makes it convenient for the foreign language learners to study outside the classroom in any place and in their own time.\n\n===Challenges and disadvantages===\nAdvances of mobile technology and of the machine translation services have helped reduce or even eliminate some of the disadvantages of mobile translation such as the reduced screen size of the mobile device and the one-finger keyboarding.

It includes any handheld electronic device that is specifically designed for audio translation. It also includes any [[machine translation]] service or [[software application]] for hand-held devices, including [[mobile telephones]], [[Pocket PC]]s, and [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s. Mobile translation provides hand-held device users with the advantage of instantaneous and non-mediated translation from one human language to another, usually against a service fee that is, nevertheless, significantly smaller than a human translator charges.\n\nMobile translation is part of the new range of services offered to \nmobile communication users, including location positioning ([[GPS]] \nservice), [[e-wallet]] (mobile banking), business card/bar-code/text \nscanning etc.\n\nIt relies on computer programming in the sphere of computational linguistics and the device's \ncommunication means (Internet connection or [[SMS]]) to work.\n\n== History ==\nA translation system allowing the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] to \nexchange conversations with foreign nationals through [[mobile phone]]s \nwas first developed in 1999 by the Advanced \nTelecommunications Research Institute International-Interpreting \nTelecommunications Research Laboratories, based in Kansai Science City, \n[[Japan]].

We've been promised this before] BY IAN SHERR, OCTOBER 4, 2017</ref>\n\n==Technical functions==\nIn order to support the machine translation service, a mobile device needs to be able to communicate with external computers (servers) that receive the user-input text/speech, translate it and send it back to the user. This is usually done via an Internet connection ([[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[GPRS]], [[EDGE]], [[UMTS]], [[Wi-Fi]]) but some earlier applications used SMS to communicate with the translation server.\n\nMobile translation is not to be confused for the user-editable (talking) dictionaries and phrase books that are already widespread and available for many hand-held devices and do not normally require internet connectivity on the mobile device.\n\n===Features===\nMobile translation may include a number of useful features, auxiliary to text translation which forms the basis of the service. While the user can input text using the device keyboard, they can also use pre-existing text in the form of email or SMS messages received on the user's device (email/SMS translation). It is also possible to send a translated message, optionally containing the source text as well as the translation.\n\nSome mobile translation applications also offer additional services that further facilitate the translated communication process, such as:\n* speech generation ([[speech synthesis]]), where the (translated) text \nmay be transformed into human speech (by a computer that renders the \nvoice of a native speaker of the target language);\n* [[speech recognition]], where the user may talk to the device which \nwill record the speech and send it to the translation server to convert \ninto text before translating it;\n* [[image translation]], where the user can take a picture (using the \ndevice camera) of some printed text (a road sign, a restaurant menu, a \npage of a book etc.), have the application send it to the translation \nserver which will apply [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) \ntechnology, extract the text, return it to the user for editing (if \nnecessary) and then translate it into the chosen language.\n* voice interpreting, where the user can select the required language \ncombination and then get connected automatically to a live interpreter.\n\n===Supported languages===\nRecently, there has been a notable increase of the number of language \npairs offered for automatic translation on mobile devices. While \nJapanese service providers traditionally offer cross-translation for \nJapanese, Chinese, English and Korean, others may offer translation from and into over 20 languages, or over 200 language pairs, including most Latin languages.\n\nSpeech generation is, however, limited to a smaller portion of the above, including English, Spanish, Italian, French, Chinese etc. Image translation depends on the OCR languages available.\n\n==Technological benefits and constraints==\n===Advantages===\nHaving portable real-time automated translation at one's disposal has a \nnumber of practical uses and advantages.\n\n* Mobilizing Human Translation: human translators can use mobile translation tools to translate wherever and whenever. Human translators no longer have to work with desktop translation software. \n* Travelling: Real time mobile translation can help people travelling to a foreign country to make themselves understood or understand others.\n* [[Business networking]]: Conducting discussions with (potential) foreign customers using mobile translation saves time and finances, and is instantaneous. Real time mobile translation is a much lower cost alternative to multilingual call centres using human translators. Networking within multinational teams may also be greatly facilitated using the service.\n* Globalization of [[Social Networking]]: Mobile translation allows chatting and text messaging with friends at an international level. New friends and associates could be made by overcoming the language barrier.\n* Learning a foreign language: Learning a foreign language can be made easier and less expensive using a mobile device equipped with real time machine translation. Statistics reveal that most college students own mobile phones and find that learning a foreign language via mobile phone proves to be cheaper than on a [[Personal computer|PC]]. Furthermore, the portability of mobile phones makes it convenient for the foreign language learners to study outside the classroom in any place and in their own time.\n\n===Challenges and disadvantages===\nAdvances of mobile technology and of the machine translation services have helped reduce or even eliminate some of the disadvantages of mobile translation such as the reduced screen size of the mobile device and the one-finger keyboarding. Many new hand-held devices come equipped with a QWERTY keyboard and/or a touch-sensitive screen, as well as handwriting recognition which significantly increases typing speed. After 2006, most new [[Mobile phone|mobile]] [[phone]]s and [[gadget|devices]] began featuring large screens with greater resolutions of 640 x 480 px, 854 x 480 px, or even 1024 x 480 \npx,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mb.softbank.jp/mb/en/product/3g/931sh/ |title=SoftBank homepage |website=Mb.softbank.jp |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref> which gives the user enough visible space to read/write large texts.

The styling differed little from the concept, except for slightly reprofiled bumpers, and the addition of rear quarterlight windows behind the doors. Factory production commenced in October 1998.\n\nEarly TT models received press coverage following a series of high-speed accidents and the related fatalities which occurred at speeds in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} during abrupt lane changes or sharp turns.  Both the coup\u00e9 and roadster variants were [[product recall|recalled]] in late 1999/early 2000, to improve predictability of the car's [[car handling|handling]] at very high speeds.<ref name=carsdesk.com>{{cite web|title=2000 Audi TT Recalls|url=https://carsdesk.com/recalls/2000/audi/tt|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref> Audi's [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) or [[Traction control system|Anti Slip Regulation]] (ASR) and rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] were added, along with\nmodifications to the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension system]]. All changes were incorporated into subsequent production.\n\nThe Audi TT was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year]]'' award for 2000.  It was also on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2000 and 2001.

The TT uses a [[transverse engine|transversely]] mounted [[internal combustion engine]], with either [[front-wheel drive]] with '[[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro four-wheel drive]]' available as an option. It was first available with a 1.8-litre [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] [[multi-valve|5-valve]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine in two states of [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]]-rated power outputs; {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engines share the same fundamental design, but the 225&nbsp;PS version features a larger K04 turbocharger (180 PS version came with a smaller K03), an additional [[intercooler]] on the left side (complementing the existing right-side [[intercooler]]), larger 20mm [[Gudgeon pin|wrist-pins]], a dual tailpipe exhaust, [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] with inlet on driver's side, and a few other internals \u2013 designed to accommodate the increase in [[turbocharger#boost|turbo boost]], from roughly {{convert|10|psi|bar|1}} peak, to {{convert|15|psi|bar|1}}. [[Haldex Traction]] enabled [[four-wheel drive]], 'branded' as \"Quattro\" was optional on the 180 engine, and standard on the more powerful 225 version.\n\n[[File:Audi TT 3.2 Roadster - Flickr - The Car Spy (1).jpg|thumb|3.2 L VR6 engine]]\n\nThe original four-cylinder engine range was complemented with a {{cvt|3189|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[VR6 engine]] rated at {{convert|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] in early 2003, which came as standard with the quattro four-wheel-drive system. In July 2003, a new six-speed [[dual clutch transmission]] \u2013 dubbed the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]] (DSG), which improves acceleration through much-reduced [[shift time]]s, was offered, along with a stiffer suspension.\n\n===TT quattro Sport{{anchor|TTqS}}===\nIn 2005, Audi released the Coup\u00e9-only limited edition (800 sold in the UK, not the 1000 originally planned) {{nowrap|'''Audi TT quattro Sport'''}}<ref name=WCF_qS>{{cite web|title=Audi TT quattro Sport revealed|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10502229479/audi-tt-quattro-sport-revealed|publisher=[[Audi|AUDI AG]]|work=WorldCarFans.com|date=22 February 2005|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> (known as the {{nowrap|'''Audi TT Club Sport'''}} in Europe).

The SUV utilized a hybrid system coupled with the 2.0-litre TFSI Inline-4 engine producing a total of {{cvt|304|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|479|lbft|Nm|0|lk=|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque. The SUV utilises a 6-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid system consists of a {{cvt|40|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the front axle and an {{cvt|85|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the rear axle. In full EV mode, the vehicle uses the rear motor only; Hybrid and Sport modes utilise all three power sources, and all-wheel-drive traction is applied as needed. Performance figures include a {{cvt|0-62|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 5.2 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of {{cvt|155|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. The distinguishing features of the concept include matrix LED headlights and two new assistance systems: One that scans intersections for potentially dangerous situations, and a second that connects to a municipality's traffic-light system in order to recommend a perfect speed to reach the next light when it is green. The interior is relatively close to the TT's with leather upholstery from Italian fashion brand Poltrona Frau and features a high-tech TFT display in front of the driver populated with the information that would normally be projected onto a central, dash-mounted screen\u2014i.e. navigation, entertainment.

The engines share the same fundamental design, but the 225&nbsp;PS version features a larger K04 turbocharger (180 PS version came with a smaller K03), an additional [[intercooler]] on the left side (complementing the existing right-side [[intercooler]]), larger 20mm [[Gudgeon pin|wrist-pins]], a dual tailpipe exhaust, [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] with inlet on driver's side, and a few other internals \u2013 designed to accommodate the increase in [[turbocharger#boost|turbo boost]], from roughly {{convert|10|psi|bar|1}} peak, to {{convert|15|psi|bar|1}}. [[Haldex Traction]] enabled [[four-wheel drive]], 'branded' as \"Quattro\" was optional on the 180 engine, and standard on the more powerful 225 version.\n\n[[File:Audi TT 3.2 Roadster - Flickr - The Car Spy (1).jpg|thumb|3.2 L VR6 engine]]\n\nThe original four-cylinder engine range was complemented with a {{cvt|3189|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[VR6 engine]] rated at {{convert|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] in early 2003, which came as standard with the quattro four-wheel-drive system.

The SUV utilized a hybrid system coupled with the 2.0-litre TFSI Inline-4 engine producing a total of {{cvt|304|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|479|lbft|Nm|0|lk=|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque. The SUV utilises a 6-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid system consists of a {{cvt|40|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the front axle and an {{cvt|85|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} electric motor on the rear axle. In full EV mode, the vehicle uses the rear motor only; Hybrid and Sport modes utilise all three power sources, and all-wheel-drive traction is applied as needed. Performance figures include a {{cvt|0-62|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 5.2 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of {{cvt|155|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. The distinguishing features of the concept include matrix LED headlights and two new assistance systems: One that scans intersections for potentially dangerous situations, and a second that connects to a municipality's traffic-light system in order to recommend a perfect speed to reach the next light when it is green. The interior is relatively close to the TT's with leather upholstery from Italian fashion brand Poltrona Frau and features a high-tech TFT display in front of the driver populated with the information that would normally be projected onto a central, dash-mounted screen\u2014i.e. navigation, entertainment. The trunk of the vehicle contains a 1:8 scale RC car as a souvenir.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/audi-tt-offroad-concept-photos-and-info-news|title=Audi TT Offroad Concept|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/282254/audi-tt-offroad-concept-revealed/|title=Audi TT Offroad Concept revealed|work=caradvice.com.au/}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Audi TT Offroad Concept (22).JPG|Audi TT Off-Road Concept\n</gallery>\n\n==Marketing==\nDue to [[Audi]]'s heavy sponsorship of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the TT S coupe made a cameo in [[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://fourtitude.com/news/Audi_News_1/audi-tts-confirmed-in-avengers-age-of-ultron/|title=Audi TTS in Age of Ultron|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> and a convertible TTS was driven by [[Peter Parker]] in [[Spider-Man: Homecoming]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20170620/RETAIL03/170629980/audi-to-star-in-new-spider-man-movie|title=Audi In Homecoming|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n\n* Lewandowski, J\u00fcrgen, Staretz, David, V\u00f6lker, Herbert: ''Das TT Buch.''

{"title_page": "John Bell (traveller)", "text_new": "{{Similar names|John Bell (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n'''John Bell''' (1691\u20131780) was a Scottish doctor and traveller.\n\n== Life ==\nBell was born at Antermony, near [[Milton of Campsie]] in Scotland. He studied medicine in [[Glasgow]], and in 1714, set out for [[Saint Petersburg]], where, through the introduction of a fellow Scot, he was nominated medical attendant to [[Artemy Volynsky]], recently appointed to the Persian embassy, with whom he travelled from 1715 to 1718. The next four years, he spent in an embassy to China, passing through [[Siberia]] and the great Tatar deserts. He had scarcely rested from this last journey when he was summoned to attend [[Peter the Great]] in his expedition to [[Derbent]] and the Caspian Gates. In 1738, he was sent by the Russian government on a mission to [[Constantinople]], returning in May to Saint Petersburg.\n\nIt appears that after this he was for several years established as a merchant at Constantinople, where he married Mary Peters, a Russian lady, and returned to Scotland in 1746, where he spent the latter part of his life on his estate, enjoying the society of his friends. After a long life spent in active beneficence and philanthropic exertions, he died at Antermony on 1&nbsp;July 1780, at the advanced age of 89. He is buried in Campsie Glen.

He studied medicine in [[Glasgow]], and in 1714, set out for [[Saint Petersburg]], where, through the introduction of a fellow Scot, he was nominated medical attendant to [[Artemy Volynsky]], recently appointed to the Persian embassy, with whom he travelled from 1715 to 1718. The next four years, he spent in an embassy to China, passing through [[Siberia]] and the great Tatar deserts. He had scarcely rested from this last journey when he was summoned to attend [[Peter the Great]] in his expedition to [[Derbent]] and the Caspian Gates. In 1738, he was sent by the Russian government on a mission to [[Constantinople]], returning in May to Saint Petersburg.\n\nIt appears that after this he was for several years established as a merchant at Constantinople, where he married Mary Peters, a Russian lady, and returned to Scotland in 1746, where he spent the latter part of his life on his estate, enjoying the society of his friends. After a long life spent in active beneficence and philanthropic exertions, he died at Antermony on 1&nbsp;July 1780, at the advanced age of 89. He is buried in Campsie Glen. His travels, published at [[Glasgow]] in 1763, were speedily translated into French, and widely circulated in Europe.\n\nHis only work is ''Travels from St. Petersburg in Russia to various parts of Asia'' 1763, in two volumes printed by Robert and Andrew Foulis of Glasgow.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled. Although, recent sources suggest otherwise saying that the 4th season of the show would be released in Fall of 2021<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[1896]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds 13 year old [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

While she acknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not pleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know and love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and addition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment unfavourably to [[Patricia Rozema]]'s [[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|1999 adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, Sarah|title=How Not to Adapt \"Anne of Green Gables\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/how-not-to-adapt-anne-of-green-gables|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> For Joanna Robinson, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for Anne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled patriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into [[misogynists]], most notably the Reverend Allan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"''Anne with an E'' seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's continually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance needs no such clumsy opposition. It also seems to think that Anne needs a radical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist in its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that conflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop tragedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Joanna|title=The Depths of Despair: Anne of Green Gables: Netflix's Bleak Adaptation Gets It All So Terribly Wrong|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 12, 2017|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/anne-of-green-gables-netflix-review-anne-with-an-e-bleak-sad-wrong}}</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], season 2 has an approval rating of 38% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anne with an E: Season 2 (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/anne/s02/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref> Hanh Nguyen writes that despite \"periods of melancholy and turmoil, this season feels more energetic and subsequently lighter because of the faster pace.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[1896]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds 13 year old [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

When their neighbor Mrs. Lynde calls her homely, skinny and redhaired, she loses her temper.

While she acknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not pleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know and love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and addition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment unfavourably to [[Patricia Rozema]]'s [[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|1999 adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, Sarah|title=How Not to Adapt \"Anne of Green Gables\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/how-not-to-adapt-anne-of-green-gables|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> For Joanna Robinson, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for Anne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled patriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into [[misogynists]], most notably the Reverend Allan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"''Anne with an E'' seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's continually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance needs no such clumsy opposition. It also seems to think that Anne needs a radical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist in its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that conflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop tragedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Joanna|title=The Depths of Despair: Anne of Green Gables: Netflix's Bleak Adaptation Gets It All So Terribly Wrong|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 12, 2017|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/anne-of-green-gables-netflix-review-anne-with-an-e-bleak-sad-wrong}}</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], season 2 has an approval rating of 38% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anne with an E: Season 2 (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/anne/s02/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref> Hanh Nguyen writes that despite \"periods of melancholy and turmoil, this season feels more energetic and subsequently lighter because of the faster pace.
