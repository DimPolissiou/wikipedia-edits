Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

At 16, he designed his first sailboat ''The Comet'' with his friend William Bennett in Hamilton, NSW, and began to make a name for himself in local competition. Ben did his sailmaking apprenticeship with Norman Wright in Queensland. Ben's designs were highly innovative. His entry, \"Taipan\" in the 1960<ref>JJ Giltinan International Trophy</ref> 18Footer World Championship started the modern era of the class and Ben won the World Championship in 1961<ref>JJ Giltinan International Trophy</ref> with the successor, \"Venom\". With friend Craig Whitworth, he founded a boat-building, sail-making and ship-chandlery firm (Miller and Whitworth) and designed boats part-time as well. One of his lasting early successes was the design that became the International [[Contender (dinghy)|Contender]]. It was selected in 1967, in multi boat trials, as a potential Olympic successor to the Finn dinghy. The Contender was awarded International status in 1968 and now has fleets in more than twelve countries throughout the world. His keelboat designs of the early 1970s featured clean, easily driven hulls and relatively small sail area. He had great success with a series of these designs starting with the innovative \"Ginkgo\".<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lexcen-benjamin-ben-14154</ref> Miller competed in the 1972 Munich Olympics representing [[Australia]] in [[sailing (sport)|sailing]] with [[Denis O'Neil]] and [[Ken Berkeley]] as fellow crew members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/athletes.cfm?Athlete=miller&Discipline=44&x=6&y=12|title=Australian Olympic Committee}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==America's Cup==\nMiller was commissioned by [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] to build ''Apollo'',<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lexcen-benjamin-ben-14154</ref> an ocean racer. This partnership continued when Bond first challenged for the [[America's Cup]] in 1974 with the Miller-designed [[12-metre class]] yacht ''[[Southern Cross (yacht)|Southern Cross]]'', named for the southern hemisphere [[Crux|constellation]]. Their challenge for the Cup was unsuccessful but Miller was kept on as the designer for future yachts, all of them designed to the [[12-metre class]] rules as used for [[America's Cup]] competition at the time.\n\nDuring the first years of his partnership with Bond, Miller withdrew his partnership from his sail-making company but the company retained its name of Miller and Whitworth. Soon after the 1974 Cup challenge, Miller changed his name to avoid confusion with his former company. Keen to prevent the possibility of there being any confusion surrounding his name and business interests in the future, he asked a friend who worked for [[Reader's Digest]] to find out the least-used surname within their membership. The result was Lexcen. \"Ben\" was the name of his dog.\n\nBond challenged for the [[1977 America's Cup]] using the Lexcen and Johan Valentijn designed 12M ''[[Australia (yacht)|Australia]]'' against media mogul [[Ted Turner]] and again with a Lexcen modified ''Australia'' in 1980 against Dennis Connor, losing both times.\n[[File:Australia II winged keel.JPG|thumb|275px|right|The winged keel of ''[[Australia II]]'']]\nAfter the [[1980 America's Cup|1980 challenge]] Lexcen realised that to win against the defenders, with their 100+ years of America's Cup experience, they would need a superior boat. His next design featured a host of advanced design features, not the least of which was a revolutionary winged keel, intended to lower the drag and to make the boat more stable and maneuverable in the water. The keel design reduced tip vortex, a turbulence resulting in conventional keels from the pressure differential between the windward (low pressure) and leeward (high pressure) sides. Australia II's design was to prove highly controversial, protested because the testing of the keel was performed in the Netherlands.<ref name=rogue>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1002b/|title=Ben Lexcen: A crazy, lovable rogue |author=Robinson, Blue |date=2 October 2009 |work=Scuttlebutt News}}</ref>\n\n''Australia II'' was a revolutionary design approach with her winged keel and hull design comprising the shortest waterline length ever measured on a 12-metre. To yachtsmen accustomed to seeing racing yachts out of the water, Australia II is striking. Its conventional long slim topsides flare down to a short waterline hinting at the dramatic, minimal, slippery underwater hull shape which was fast to turn as well as easily driven and quick to accelerate. Ben often remarked that Australia II is a whole boat, not just a keel. The [[New York Yacht Club]], holders of the Cup, formally protested both that Australia II was not a legal 12 Metre, and that the design itself was not of Australian origin. The ruling arrived at on the boat confirmed that ''Australia II'' complied with both the [[12-metre class]] and the [[America's Cup]] rules. The questions on her design origin were not formally answered at the time, {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but the controversy re-emerged in 2009 (see [[Australia II#Later claims of Dutch design|Later claims of Dutch Design]] for details). Claims that Peter van Oossanen was the designer of the ''Australia II'''s keel instead of by Ben have been strongly rejected by [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] and by John Longley, a key member of the ''Australia II'' team using documentary evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026060758/http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |archivedate=26 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}></ref>\n\nThe [[1983 America's Cup]] saw Lexcen's ''[[Australia II]]'', with [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] at the helm, take on the NYYC skipper [[Dennis Conner]] and the defender yacht, [[Liberty (yacht)|''Liberty'']]. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had dominated the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused ''Australia II'' to fall behind, losing the first two races. ''Australia II'' stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This was the first time in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin.  At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable.  Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark.  Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked \"dummy\" tacks trying to break the Australians' cover.   Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race.  Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] for his contributions to the winning design.\n\nLexcen was commissioned by Bond once again in 1986 to design a defender for the [[1987 America's Cup]].  He designed ''Australia III'' and ''[[Australia IV]]'' for Bond's two boat defense program.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was ultimately defeated by the [[Iain Murray (yachtsman)|Iain Murray]] designed and skippered ''[[Kookaburra III]]'' in the [[1987 Defender Selection Series|Defender Trials]]. Steve Ward (builder of all four \"Australias\" maintains that Lexen's design was not at fault but that ''[[Australia IV]]'' was uncompetitive due to last minute design modifications ordered by the upper echelons of Bond Corporation.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was originally designed to be longer on the waterline with less sail area similar to Conner's winning design.  Australia competed in the Cup without a Lexcen designed boat for the first time in ten years. ''Kookaburra III'' lost in the finals to Dennis Conner and his American challenger, ''[[Stars & Stripes 87]]'', 4 races to nil.<ref name=classic12metercharters>{{cite web|url=http://www.classic12metercharters.com/history.asp|title=The 12-Metre Class America's Cup Contenders 1958\u20131987 |accessdate=2008-02-23|work=Sail World}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nLexcen died suddenly in [[Manly, New South Wales]] on 1 May 1988, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at 52 years of age.

This partnership continued when Bond first challenged for the [[America's Cup]] in 1974 with the Miller-designed [[12-metre class]] yacht ''[[Southern Cross (yacht)|Southern Cross]]'', named for the southern hemisphere [[Crux|constellation]]. Their challenge for the Cup was unsuccessful but Miller was kept on as the designer for future yachts, all of them designed to the [[12-metre class]] rules as used for [[America's Cup]] competition at the time.\n\nDuring the first years of his partnership with Bond, Miller withdrew his partnership from his sail-making company but the company retained its name of Miller and Whitworth. Soon after the 1974 Cup challenge, Miller changed his name to avoid confusion with his former company. Keen to prevent the possibility of there being any confusion surrounding his name and business interests in the future, he asked a friend who worked for [[Reader's Digest]] to find out the least-used surname within their membership. The result was Lexcen. \"Ben\" was the name of his dog.\n\nBond challenged for the [[1977 America's Cup]] using the Lexcen and Johan Valentijn designed 12M ''[[Australia (yacht)|Australia]]'' against media mogul [[Ted Turner]] and again with a Lexcen modified ''Australia'' in 1980 against Dennis Connor, losing both times.\n[[File:Australia II winged keel.JPG|thumb|275px|right|The winged keel of ''[[Australia II]]'']]\nAfter the [[1980 America's Cup|1980 challenge]] Lexcen realised that to win against the defenders, with their 100+ years of America's Cup experience, they would need a superior boat. His next design featured a host of advanced design features, not the least of which was a revolutionary winged keel, intended to lower the drag and to make the boat more stable and maneuverable in the water. The keel design reduced tip vortex, a turbulence resulting in conventional keels from the pressure differential between the windward (low pressure) and leeward (high pressure) sides. Australia II's design was to prove highly controversial, protested because the testing of the keel was performed in the Netherlands.<ref name=rogue>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1002b/|title=Ben Lexcen: A crazy, lovable rogue |author=Robinson, Blue |date=2 October 2009 |work=Scuttlebutt News}}</ref>\n\n''Australia II'' was a revolutionary design approach with her winged keel and hull design comprising the shortest waterline length ever measured on a 12-metre. To yachtsmen accustomed to seeing racing yachts out of the water, Australia II is striking. Its conventional long slim topsides flare down to a short waterline hinting at the dramatic, minimal, slippery underwater hull shape which was fast to turn as well as easily driven and quick to accelerate. Ben often remarked that Australia II is a whole boat, not just a keel. The [[New York Yacht Club]], holders of the Cup, formally protested both that Australia II was not a legal 12 Metre, and that the design itself was not of Australian origin. The ruling arrived at on the boat confirmed that ''Australia II'' complied with both the [[12-metre class]] and the [[America's Cup]] rules. The questions on her design origin were not formally answered at the time, {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but the controversy re-emerged in 2009 (see [[Australia II#Later claims of Dutch design|Later claims of Dutch Design]] for details). Claims that Peter van Oossanen was the designer of the ''Australia II'''s keel instead of by Ben have been strongly rejected by [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] and by John Longley, a key member of the ''Australia II'' team using documentary evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026060758/http://archive.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/09/1019/ |archivedate=26 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}></ref>\n\nThe [[1983 America's Cup]] saw Lexcen's ''[[Australia II]]'', with [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] at the helm, take on the NYYC skipper [[Dennis Conner]] and the defender yacht, [[Liberty (yacht)|''Liberty'']]. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had dominated the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused ''Australia II'' to fall behind, losing the first two races. ''Australia II'' stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This was the first time in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin.  At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable.  Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark.  Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked \"dummy\" tacks trying to break the Australians' cover.   Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race.  Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] for his contributions to the winning design.\n\nLexcen was commissioned by Bond once again in 1986 to design a defender for the [[1987 America's Cup]].  He designed ''Australia III'' and ''[[Australia IV]]'' for Bond's two boat defense program.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was ultimately defeated by the [[Iain Murray (yachtsman)|Iain Murray]] designed and skippered ''[[Kookaburra III]]'' in the [[1987 Defender Selection Series|Defender Trials]]. Steve Ward (builder of all four \"Australias\" maintains that Lexen's design was not at fault but that ''[[Australia IV]]'' was uncompetitive due to last minute design modifications ordered by the upper echelons of Bond Corporation.  ''[[Australia IV]]'' was originally designed to be longer on the waterline with less sail area similar to Conner's winning design.  Australia competed in the Cup without a Lexcen designed boat for the first time in ten years. ''Kookaburra III'' lost in the finals to Dennis Conner and his American challenger, ''[[Stars & Stripes 87]]'', 4 races to nil.<ref name=classic12metercharters>{{cite web|url=http://www.classic12metercharters.com/history.asp|title=The 12-Metre Class America's Cup Contenders 1958\u20131987 |accessdate=2008-02-23|work=Sail World}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nLexcen died suddenly in [[Manly, New South Wales]] on 1 May 1988, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at 52 years of age.

It follows that the solutions of such an equation are exactly the zeros of the function <math>f</math>. In other words, a \"zero of a function\" is precisely a \"solution of the equation obtained by equating the function to 0\", and the study of zeros of functions is exactly the same as the study of solutions of equations.\n\n== Polynomial roots ==\n{{main|Properties of polynomial roots}}\nEvery real polynomial of odd [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] has an odd number of real roots (counting [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicities]]); likewise, a real polynomial of even degree must have an even number of real roots. Consequently, real odd polynomials must have at least one real root (because the smallest odd whole number is 1), whereas even polynomials may have none. This principle can be proven by reference to the [[intermediate value theorem]]: since polynomial functions are [[Continuous function|continuous]], the function value must cross zero, in the process of changing from negative to positive or vice versa (which always happens for odd functions).\n\n===Fundamental theorem of algebra===\n{{main|Fundamental theorem of algebra}}\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of degree <math>n</math> has <math>n</math> complex roots, counted with their multiplicities. The non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] pairs.<ref name=\"Foerster\" /> [[Vieta's formulas]] relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n\n== Computing roots ==\n{{main|Root-finding algorithm|Real-root isolation|Equation solving}}\nComputing roots of functions, for example [[polynomial function]]s, frequently requires the use of specialised or [[approximation]] techniques (e.g., [[Newton's method]]). However, some polynomial functions, including all those of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] no greater than 4, can have all their roots expressed [[algebraic function|algebraically]] in terms of their coefficients (for more, see [[algebraic solution]]).\n\n==Zero set==\n\nIn various areas of mathematics, the '''zero set''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is the set of all its zeros. More precisely, if <math>f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> is a [[real-valued function]] (or, more generally, a function taking values in some [[Abelian group|additive group]]), its zero set is <math>f^{-1}(0)</math>, the [[inverse image]] of <math>\\{0\\}</math> in <math>X</math>.\n\nThe term ''zero set'' is generally used when there are infinitely many zeros, and they have some non-trivial [[topology|topological properties]]. For example, a [[level set]] of a function <math>f</math> is the zero set of <math>f-c</math>. The '''cozero set''' of <math>f</math> is the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the zero set of <math>f</math> (i.e., the subset of <math>X</math> on which <math>f</math> is nonzero).\n\n=== Applications ===\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], the first definition of an [[algebraic variety]] is through zero sets. Specifically, an [[affine algebraic set]] is the [[set intersection|intersection]] of the zero sets of several polynomials, in a [[polynomial ring]] <math>k\\left[x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\right]</math> over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In this context, a zero set is sometimes called a ''zero locus''.\n\nIn [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]], any [[closed set|closed subset]] of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is the zero set of a [[smooth function]] defined on all of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. This extends to any [[smooth manifold]] as a corollary of [[paracompactness]]. <!-- There is obvious overlap between this and the next paragraph, but it takes someone more experienced to merge the two. -->\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], zero sets are frequently used to define [[manifold]]s. An important special case is the case that <math>f</math> is a [[smooth function]] from <math>\\mathbb{R}^p</math> to <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. If zero is a [[regular value]] of <math>f</math>, then the zero set of <math>f</math> is a smooth manifold of dimension <math>m=p-n</math> by the [[Submersion_(mathematics)#Local_normal_form|regular value theorem]].\n\nFor example, the unit <math>m</math>-[[sphere]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}</math> is the zero set of the real-valued function <math>f(x)=\\Vert x \\Vert^2-1</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Marden's theorem]]\n*[[Root-finding algorithm]]\n*[[Sendov's conjecture]]\n* [[Vanish at infinity]]\n* [[Zero crossing]]\n*[[Zeros and poles]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{MathWorld |title=Root |urlname=Root}}\n\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n[[Category:Functions and mappings]]\n[[Category:0 (number)]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Polynomial root|finding polynomial roots|Root finding of polynomials|advanced properties|Properties of polynomial roots}}\n{{redirect|Zero set|the musical album|Zero Set}}\n\n{{Css Image Crop |Image = X-intercepts.svg |bSize = 300 |cWidth = 300 |cHeight = 110 |oLeft = 0 |oTop = 100 |Location = right |Description = A graph of the function <math>\\cos(x)</math> for <math>x</math> in <math>\\left[-2\\pi,2\\pi\\right]</math>, with '''zeros''' at <math>-\\tfrac{3\\pi}{2},\\;-\\tfrac{\\pi}{2},\\;\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}</math>, and <math>\\tfrac{3\\pi}{2},</math> marked in <span style=\"color:red\">red</span>.}} \n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''zero''' (also sometimes called a '''root''') of a [[Real number|real]]-, [[Complex number|complex]]-, or generally [[vector-valued function]] <math>f</math>, is a member <math>x</math> of the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of <math>f</math> such that <math>f(x)</math> ''vanishes'' at <math>x</math>; that is, the function <math>f</math> attains the value of 0 at <math>x</math>,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#vanish|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon \u2014 Vanish|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> or equivalently, <math>x</math> is the [[Solution (mathematics)|solution]] to the equation <math>f(x) = 0</math>.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/ZeroesOfPolynomials.aspx|title=Algebra - Zeroes/Roots of Polynomials|website=tutorial.math.lamar.edu|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> A \"zero\" of a function is thus an input value that produces an output of <math>0</math>.<ref name=\"Foerster\">{{cite book | last = Foerster | first = Paul A. | title = Algebra and Trigonometry: Functions and Applications, Teacher's Edition | edition = Classics | year = 2006 | page = [https://archive.org/details/algebratrigonome00paul_0/page/535 535] | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | url = https://archive.org/details/algebratrigonome00paul_0/page/535 | isbn = 0-13-165711-9 }}</ref>\n\nA '''root''' of a [[polynomial]] is a zero of the corresponding [[polynomial function]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] shows that any non-zero [[polynomial]] has a number of roots at most equal to its [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]], and that the number of roots and the degree are equal when one considers the complex roots (or more generally, the roots in an [[algebraically closed extension]]) counted with their [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathplanet.com/education/algebra-2/polynomial-functions/roots-and-zeros|title=Roots and zeros (Algebra 2, Polynomial functions)|website=Mathplanet|language=en|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref> For example, the polynomial <math>f</math> of degree two, defined by \n:<math>f(x)=x^2-5x+6</math>\nhas the two roots <math>2</math> and <math>3</math>, since\n:<math>f(2) = 2^2 - 5 \\cdot 2 + 6 = 0\\quad\\textrm{and}\\quad f(3) = 3^2 - 5 \\cdot 3 + 6 = 0</math>.\n\nIf the function maps real numbers to real numbers, then its zeros are the <math>x</math>-coordinates of the points where its [[Graph of a function|graph]] meets the [[x-axis|''x''-axis]].

This principle can be proven by reference to the [[intermediate value theorem]]: since polynomial functions are [[Continuous function|continuous]], the function value must cross zero, in the process of changing from negative to positive or vice versa (which always happens for odd functions).\n\n===Fundamental theorem of algebra===\n{{main|Fundamental theorem of algebra}}\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of degree <math>n</math> has <math>n</math> complex roots, counted with their multiplicities. The non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] pairs.<ref name=\"Foerster\" /> [[Vieta's formulas]] relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n\n== Computing roots ==\n{{main|Root-finding algorithm|Real-root isolation|Equation solving}}\nComputing roots of functions, for example [[polynomial function]]s, frequently requires the use of specialised or [[approximation]] techniques (e.g., [[Newton's method]]). However, some polynomial functions, including all those of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] no greater than 4, can have all their roots expressed [[algebraic function|algebraically]] in terms of their coefficients (for more, see [[algebraic solution]]).\n\n==Zero set==\n\nIn various areas of mathematics, the '''zero set''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is the set of all its zeros. More precisely, if <math>f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> is a [[real-valued function]] (or, more generally, a function taking values in some [[Abelian group|additive group]]), its zero set is <math>f^{-1}(0)</math>, the [[inverse image]] of <math>\\{0\\}</math> in <math>X</math>.\n\nThe term ''zero set'' is generally used when there are infinitely many zeros, and they have some non-trivial [[topology|topological properties]]. For example, a [[level set]] of a function <math>f</math> is the zero set of <math>f-c</math>. The '''cozero set''' of <math>f</math> is the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the zero set of <math>f</math> (i.e., the subset of <math>X</math> on which <math>f</math> is nonzero).\n\n=== Applications ===\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], the first definition of an [[algebraic variety]] is through zero sets. Specifically, an [[affine algebraic set]] is the [[set intersection|intersection]] of the zero sets of several polynomials, in a [[polynomial ring]] <math>k\\left[x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\right]</math> over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In this context, a zero set is sometimes called a ''zero locus''.\n\nIn [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]], any [[closed set|closed subset]] of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is the zero set of a [[smooth function]] defined on all of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. This extends to any [[smooth manifold]] as a corollary of [[paracompactness]]. <!-- There is obvious overlap between this and the next paragraph, but it takes someone more experienced to merge the two. -->\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], zero sets are frequently used to define [[manifold]]s. An important special case is the case that <math>f</math> is a [[smooth function]] from <math>\\mathbb{R}^p</math> to <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. If zero is a [[regular value]] of <math>f</math>, then the zero set of <math>f</math> is a smooth manifold of dimension <math>m=p-n</math> by the [[Submersion_(mathematics)#Local_normal_form|regular value theorem]].\n\nFor example, the unit <math>m</math>-[[sphere]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}</math> is the zero set of the real-valued function <math>f(x)=\\Vert x \\Vert^2-1</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Marden's theorem]]\n*[[Root-finding algorithm]]\n*[[Sendov's conjecture]]\n* [[Vanish at infinity]]\n* [[Zero crossing]]\n*[[Zeros and poles]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{MathWorld |title=Root |urlname=Root}}\n\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n[[Category:Functions and mappings]]\n[[Category:0 (number)]]\n", "name_user": "D.Lazard", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function"}

Later, with the strengthening of [[English East India Company]], and with Travancore signing a treaty handing over defence to the Company's army, the Nair Brigade headcount was reduced.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe total strength of Travancore Nair Army in 1945 was 4,082 men, of which 84 were officers and 132 were JCOs. A part of this force (those within medical categorization 'A') were absorbed into the Indian Army (Travancore - Cochin unified forces), while the remaining forces were disbanded. After the unification of Travancore and Cochin forces, Trivandrum was declared as the headquarters of the unified command. [[Major General]] [[V.N. Parameswaran Pillai]], the GOC of the Travancore Nair army, became the commandant of the unified forces. The unified force was divided into five infantry battalions (Travancore - I, II, III and IV, Cochin I). The unification took place under [[Major General]] [[V.N. Parameswaran Pillai]] of [[Travancore]] and [[Lt Col]] G.S. Subbiah of Cochin on 20 May 1949. Finally the forces unified Travancore-Cochin forces were either disbanded or absorbed into the Indian Army and [[Major General]] [[V.N.

The club won its first [[List of NBL champions|NBL Championship]] after defeating the [[Perth Wildcats]] 2-1 in the [[NBL Grand Final|Grand Final series]] in 1993. In [[1996 NBL season|1996]], the Tigers lost to cross town rival South East Melbourne Magic in the   [[NBL Grand Final|Grand Final series]] 1-2. But a year later the reversed the order and won it all for the second time.\n\nThe Melbourne Tigers played their home games at the 14,820 seat [[Rod Laver Arena]]. Following a strong 1996 season where the Tigers finished 21-5, they decided to end long time relationship with import Dave Simmons. In the 1997 season the Tigers signed import Jarvis Lang to start at forward, after early struggles and Mark Bradtke unavailable due to being in the NBA at the start the Tigers started 4-9 and were second last on the NBL ladder. When injuries plaguing Lang and his struggles with learning the tigers offense, the tigers decided to replaced Lang with Marcus Timmons. Marcus Timmons brought an athlete game to Melbourne thrilling the fans with high light dunks, lockdown defense and solid three point shots with an all round game that complemented the other tiger star. Behind Gaze, Copeland, Timmons and the return of the big man in middle Mark Bradtke who missed the first couple games due to being under contact in the NBA, the Tigers turned around there early struggles to finish 19-11 and reached their fourth NBL Grand Final series, winning it all against cross town rivals south east Melbourne Magic. As they finished a historic NBL season not only winning the championship rings they finished the season on a 17-1 run. The tigers had a 13 game win streak to finish regular season and had a record of 16 game winning streak through the season and playoffs.\n\nThe 1997 Melbourne Tigers compiled a 19-11 record in the regular season before going 5-1 in the playoffs to claim their second title. Technically the tigers finished 20-10 but the league stripped one of there wins because center Mark Bradtke clearance from the NBA wasn\u2019t properly filled out before they faced the 36ers. When fully healthy, the core of Gaze, Copeland, Timmons and Bradtke were 15-2 and 5-1 in the playoffs. The 1997 Melbourne Tigers is considered one of the greatest teams of all time.\n\n== Roster ==\n{{Basketball roster header|type=NBL|age=n\n| team=Melbourne Tigers}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player3 | pos = SF/SG | num = 6 | nat = AUS | first = Warrick | last = Giddey | m = 1.98 | kgs = 98}}\n{{player3 | pos = PF/SF | num = 7| nat = AUS | first = Daniel  | last = Egan | dab = basketball | m = 1.98| kgs = 100}}\n{{player3 | pos = PG/SG | num = 8 | nat = AUS | first = Ray | last = Gordon | m = 1.91 | kgs = 80}}\n{{player3 | pos = SG/PG | num = 10 | nat = AUS | first = Andrew | last = Gaze | m = 2.01 | kgs = 95 | note = C}}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 11 | nat = AUS | first = Brett | last = Jeffries | dab = basketball | m = 2.02 | kgs = 100}}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 13 | nat = AUS | first = Damian | last = Chapman | dab = basketball | m = 1.90 | kgs = 80 | note = DP}}\n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 21 | nat = USA | first = Lanard | last = Copeland | m = 2.00 | kgs = 88 | note = I}}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 22 | nat = AUS | first = Erik | last = Wickstrom | dab = AUS basketball | m = 1.90 | kgs = 75| note = DP}} \n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 23| nat = AUS | first = Brett | last = Rainbow | dab = basketball | m = 1.92 | kgs = 100}}\n{{player3 | pos = F/C | num = 31 | nat = AUS | first = Blair | last = Smith | dab = basketball | m = 2.05 | kgs = 105}}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 40 | nat = USA | first =Marcus | last = Timmons | m = 2.02 | kgs = 100 | note = I}}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 44 | nat = USA | first =Jarvis | last = Lang | m = 2.00 | kgs = 100 | note = I}}\n{{player3 | pos = C | num = 50 | nat = AUS | first = Mark | last =Bradtke | dab = AUS basketball | m = 2.08 | kgs = 120}}\n{{Basketball roster footer\n| head_coach =\n* {{player||AUS|Lindsey Gaze}}\n| asst_coach =\n* {{player||AUS|Al Westover}}\n| I = y\n}}\n\n=== Depth chart ===\n{{basketball depth chart\n| bench 3_label = Reserves\n| starter_c =  [[Mark Bradtke]]\n| bench 1_c =  [[Blair Smith]]\n| bench 2_c = \n| bench 3_c = \n| starter_pf =   [[Marcus Timmons]]\n| bench 1_pf =  [[Brett Jeffries]]\n| bench 2_pf =  \n| bench 3_pf =   [[Jarvis Lang]]\n| starter_sf =   [[Warrick Giddey]]\n| bench 1_sf =  [[Daniel Egan]]\n| bench 2_sf = \n| bench 3_sf =  \n| starter_sg =   [[Lanard Copeland]]\n| bench 1_sg =  [[Brett Rainbow]]\n| bench 2_sg = \n| bench 3_sg =  \n| starter_pg =   [[Andrew Gaze]]\n| bench 1_pg =   [[Ray Gordon]]\n| bench 2_pg =  [[Erik Wickstorm]]\n| bench 3_pg =  [[Daniel Chapman]]\n}}\n\n==Ladder==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=25|#\n!width=150|Team\n!width=40|Pld\n!width=40|W\n!width=40|L\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|[[South East Melbourne Magic]]\n|30\n|22\n|8\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|[[Melbourne Tigers]]\n|30\n|19\n|11\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|[[North Melbourne Giants]]\n|30\n|18\n|12\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|[[Perth Wildcats]]\n|30\n|17\n|13\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|[[Canberra Cannons]]\n|30\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|[[Brisbane Bullets]]\n|30\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|[[Townsville Crocodiles|Townsville Suns]]\n|30\n|14\n|16\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|[[Adelaide 36ers]]\n|30\n|14\n|16\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|[[Sydney Kings]]\n|30\n|12\n|18\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|[[Newcastle Falcons (basketball)|Newcastle Falcons]]\n|30\n|12\n|18\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|[[Wollongong Hawks|Illawarra Hawks]]\n|30\n|12\n|23\n|}\n\n==Player statistics==\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA roster statistics legend}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!

Melbourne decided to let go long time import Dave Simmons after eight years and one championship with the power forward. In Simmons' place they decided to sign import forward Jarvis Lang. Motivated by their loss of the year before, they looked to win it all in 1997.\n\nThe Tigers had a slow start to the season, starting off the season at 4-9 there was talk in the herald sun about sacking the team's long term head coach Lindsey Gaze, but soon after the article there were major changes but it wasn\u2019t the head coach who was let go it was the import Jarvis Lang who was dealing with knee soreness and struggling to learn the Melbourne tigers shuffle offense, in turn the tigers turned the season around by winning 16 straight games 17-1 during the end of the regular season and finals. This all was helped by the signing of Marcus Timmons, who added a punch both on the offensive and defensive side of the floor.  The Tigers went from second last at 4-9 on the ladder during the start of the season to end up finishing in second place at 19-11 having a run of 13 game winning streak to end the regular season. The tigers were meant to finish the regular season with a 20-10 record but because of some paper work that wasn\u2019t finalized, the league stripped the tigers of a win over in round 3 against the 36ers the tigers were furious that the league stripped them of the win to say the least. When fully healthy, the core of Gaze, Copeland, Timmons and Bradtke were 15-2 and 5-1 in the playoffs making this team one of the most dominant teams all of time. As expected, the team was led by Andrew Gaze, who had one of his best shooting seasons of his career, averaging just on 4 3 point field goals made making 143 for the season, whilst averaging his typical over 30 points per game and over 6 assists. Alongside him in the back court, Lanard Copeland averaged his typical over 22 points for the season, whilst big man Mark Bradtke anchored down low averaging 20 points over 12 rebounds. Warrick Giddey would provide a toughness and defence that he built his reputation on. Key bench players Ray Gordon and Blair Smith were solid players off the bench for the Tigers. After letting go of Jarvis Lang, they signed Marcus Timmons who had a terrific year helping the Tigers on both the offensive and defensive side of the floor averaging over 17 points and over 8 rebounds. Andrew Gaze would be named MVP and both he and Mark Bradtke would be named to All-First NBL team, whilst Andrew Gaze and Mark Bradtke were named to the all star game.\n\n===Semi-finals===\nAlong with the 1st placed [[South East Melbourne Magic]], the Tigers were given a bye in the quarter-finals. In their three-game semi-final against the 3rd placed [[North Melbourne Giants]] there was little resistance, sweeping them in two games. The Tigers would be moving on to their second consecutive grand final appearance. Andrew Gaze was outstanding in the semi-finals, averaging 36.5 points and 9.5 assists per game. Ahead of the Tigers was cross town rival South East Melbourne Magic, the same team that they had lost to the year before in the deciding game 3.\n\n==NBL grand final==\n\nThe Tigers' opponents in the 1997 NBL Grand Final would again be the South East Melbourne Magic who were the same team that beat the Tigers in the previous grand final in game 3. All 3 of the games would be held at Melbourne Park, game 3 if needed. Similar to the Tigers the Magic swept their previous round of the finals. There was a lot of hype for people to watch the best offensive team in the Melbourne Tigers vs the best defensive team in the South East, Melbourne Magic.\n\nGame 1 was a beat down from the Tigers, who were on full attack from the beginning, never trailing in the game and winning 111-74. Larand Copeland was the game's high scorer with 29, whilst Gaze added 23 and 9 assists. The Melbourne Tigers landed 3 pointers left right and centre whilst the bigs of Bradtke and Timmons controlled the paint. Frank Drimc was top scorer with 12 for the Magic.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?action=MATCH&fixture=500766159&client=0-189-12322-125723-369917 |title=National Basketball League (NBL) Match Centre - SportsTG |publisher=Websites.sportstg.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly to the year before after dropping the first game, Game 2 was a lot better for the Magic. They started veteran John Dorge over the young Chris Anstey. The Magic bounced back to beat the Tigers, winning the close game to even the series at 1-1 and forcing a game 3 for the second straight year against the Magic and Tigers. The scores were 84-78 with Chris Anstey bouncing back from an average game one dropping 21 points in game 2. Lanard Copeland was the Tigers' high scorer with 28.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?action=MATCH&fixture=500764221&client=0-189-12322-125723-369917 |title=National Basketball League (NBL) Match Centre - SportsTG |publisher=Websites.sportstg.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\nFor the second straight year the Melbourne Tigers played the South East Melbourne Magic in game 3 to decide who would win the championship. The Melbourne Tigers won the NBL championship with a score line of 93-83 in a tough hard fought game which in the end the tigers took control with the top scorer again being Larand Copeland with 26 points; Gaze added 22 and 9 assists. Lanard Copeland was named [[NBL Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] after having an amazing series averaging 28 points against the best defensive team in the league, there was no one on the magic who could stop lanard.\nNot only did winning this championship cement the tigers to being one of the greatest teams of all time but also made them one of the greatest clues in NBL history.\n\nTo top it all off with Andrew Gaze winning his second championship ring it would cement him to being the goat (greatest player of all time) of the NBL even to this day\n<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?action=MATCH&fixture=500767036&client=0-189-12322-125723-369917 |title=National Basketball League (NBL) Match Centre - SportsTG |publisher=Websites.sportstg.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\n===Game 1===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=October 25th |time=12:00 p.m. [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|EST]] |place=[[Melbourne Park]] |TV=[[TVQ|TV 0]] |referee=Bill Mildenhall, Ray Hunt, Scott Butler\n|team1=[[South East Melbourne Magic]] |score1=74\n|team2='''[[Melbourne Tigers]]''' |score2='''111'''\n|report=<ref name=\"auto\"/> Box score\n|Q1=20-'''29''' |Q2=17-'''32'''| |Q3=14-'''17'''|Q4=23-'''33'''|\n|points1=[[Frank Drimc]] 12\n|points2=[[Larnad Copeland]] 29\n|rebounds1=[[Frank Drimc]] 11\n|rebounds2=[[Mark Bradtke]] 9\n|assist1=[[Sam Mackinnon]] 4\n|assist2=[[Andrew Gaze]] 9\n|series=Melbourne leads series, 1&ndash;0\n}}\n\n===Game 2===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=October 29th |time=12:00 p.m. [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|EST]] |place=[[Melbourne Park]] |TV=[[TVQ|TV 0]] |referee=Bill Mildenhall,\nEddie Crouch, Michael Butler\n|team1=[[Melbourne Tigers]] |score1=78\n|team2='''[[South East Melbourne Magic]]''' |score2='''84'''\n|report=<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Box score\n|Q1='''25'''-21 |Q2=22-'''24''' |Q3=19-'''20''' |Q4=12-'''19'''\n|points1=[[Lanard Copeland]] 29\n|points2=[[Chris Anstey]] 21\n|rebounds1=[[Marcus timmons]] 12\n|rebounds2=[[Michael Kelly (basketball)|Mike Kelly]] 10\n|assist1=[[Andrew Gaze]] 5\n|assist2=[[Sam Mackinnon]] 6\n|series=Series tied, 1&ndash;1\n}}\n\n===Game 3===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=September 1st |time=12:00 p.m. [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|EST]] |place=[[Melbourne Park]] |TV |referee=Bill Mildenhall\n, Ray Hunt, Scott Butler\n|team1=[[South East Melbourne Magic]] |score1=83\n|team2='''[[Melbourne Tigers]]''' |score2='''93'''\n|report=<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Box score\n|Q1=21-'''25''' |Q2=15-'''25'''| |Q3=19-'''20'''|Q4='''28'''-23|\n|points1=[[Tony Ronaldson]] 26\n|points2=[[Larnad Copeland]] 26\n|rebounds1=[[Frank Drimc]] 9\n|rebounds2=[[Marcus Timmons]] 13\n|assist1=[[Sam Mackinnon]] 6\n|assist2=[[Andrew Gaze]] 9\n|series=Melbourne wins series and NBL Championship, 2&ndash;1<br>Grand Final MVP: [[Lanard Copeland]] (Melbourne)\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*http://websites.sportstg.com/team_info.cgi?c=0-189-12322-125723-369917&a=STATS\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Warrick_Giddey/Australia/Werribee-Devils/8140\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Daniel_Egan/Australia/Townsville-Heat/9957\n*http://basketball.eurobasket.com/player/Brett_Jeffries/Sweden/Alvik-Basket-Stockholm/15749\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Erik-Wickstrom/Australia/Sandringham_Sabres/25312\n*https://www.tigersbasketball.com.au/20th-anniversary-of-melbourne-tigers-vba-championship-part-2/\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Brett_Rainbow/Australia/Ringwood-Hawks/12349\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Blair_Smith/Australia/Gladstone-Port-City-Power/12470\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Marcus_Timmons/Australia/Hawthorn-Magic/24513\n\n[[Category:1997 in Australian basketball]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=June 2018}}{{Infobox NBL season\n| team = [[Melbourne Tigers]]\n| wins = 19\n| losses = 11\n| coach = Lindsey Gaze\n| captain = [[Andrew Gaze]]\n| arena = [[Rod Laver Arena]] (14,820)\n| ladder = '''2nd'''\n| finals = '''NBL Champions''' \n\n(Defeated Magic 2-1)\n\n| color1 = #FFDF00\n| color2 = #FF0000\n| color3 = #00000\n| prevseason = [[1996 Melbourne Tigers season|1996]]\n| nextseason = [[1998 Melbounre Tigers season|1998]]\n}}\n\nThe [[1997 NBL season]] was the 14th season for the [[Melbourne Tigers]] in the Australian-based [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|National Basketball League]]. The club won its first [[List of NBL champions|NBL Championship]] after defeating the [[Perth Wildcats]] 2-1 in the [[NBL Grand Final|Grand Final series]] in 1993. In [[1996 NBL season|1996]], the Tigers lost to cross town rival South East Melbourne Magic in the   [[NBL Grand Final|Grand Final series]] 1-2. But a year later the reversed the order and won it all for the second time.\n\nThe Melbourne Tigers played their home games at the 14,820 seat [[Rod Laver Arena]]. Following a strong 1996 season where the Tigers finished 21-5, they decided to end long time relationship with import Dave Simmons. In the 1997 season the Tigers signed import Jarvis Lang to start at forward, after early struggles and Mark Bradtke unavailable due to being in the NBA at the start the Tigers started 4-9 and were second last on the NBL ladder. When injuries plaguing Lang and his struggles with learning the tigers offense, the tigers decided to replaced Lang with Marcus Timmons. Marcus Timmons brought an athlete game to Melbourne thrilling the fans with high light dunks, lockdown defense and solid three point shots with an all round game that complemented the other tiger star. Behind Gaze, Copeland, Timmons and the return of the big man in middle Mark Bradtke who missed the first couple games due to being under contact in the NBA, the Tigers turned around there early struggles to finish 19-11 and reached their fourth NBL Grand Final series, winning it all against cross town rivals south east Melbourne Magic. As they finished a historic NBL season not only winning the championship rings they finished the season on a 17-1 run. The tigers had a 13 game win streak to finish regular season and had a record of 16 game winning streak through the season and playoffs.\n\nThe 1997 Melbourne Tigers compiled an 19-11 record in the regular season before going 5-1 in the playoffs to claim their second title. Technically the tigers finished 20-10 but the league stripped one of there wins because center Mark Bradtke clearance from the NBA wasn\u2019t properly filled out before they faced the 36ers. When fully healthy, the core of Gaze, Copeland, Timmons and Bradtke were 15-2 and 5-1 in the playoffs. The 1997 Melbourne Tigers is considered one of the greatest teams of all time.\n\n== Roster ==\n{{Basketball roster header|type=NBL|age=n\n| team=Melbourne Tigers}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player3 | pos = SF/SG | num = 6 | nat = AUS | first = Warrick | last = Giddey | m = 1.98 | kgs = 98}}\n{{player3 | pos = PF/SF | num = 7| nat = AUS | first = Daniel  | last = Egan | dab = basketball | m = 1.98| kgs = 100}}\n{{player3 | pos = PG/SG | num = 8 | nat = AUS | first = Ray | last = Gordon | m = 1.91 | kgs = 80}}\n{{player3 | pos = SG/PG | num = 10 | nat = AUS | first = Andrew | last = Gaze | m = 2.01 | kgs = 95 | note = C}}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 11 | nat = AUS | first = Brett | last = Jeffries | dab = basketball | m = 2.02 | kgs = 100}}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 13 | nat = AUS | first = Damian | last = Chapman | dab = basketball | m = 1.90 | kgs = 80 | note = DP}}\n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 21 | nat = USA | first = Lanard | last = Copeland | m = 2.00 | kgs = 88 | note = I}}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 22 | nat = AUS | first = Erik | last = Wickstrom | dab = AUS basketball | m = 1.90 | kgs = 75| note = DP}} \n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 23| nat = AUS | first = Brett | last = Rainbow | dab = basketball | m = 1.92 | kgs = 100}}\n{{player3 | pos = F/C | num = 31 | nat = AUS | first = Blair | last = Smith | dab = basketball | m = 2.05 | kgs = 105}}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 40 | nat = USA | first =Marcus | last = Timmons | m = 2.02 | kgs = 100 | note = I}}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 44 | nat = USA | first =Jarvis | last = Lang | m = 2.00 | kgs = 100 | note = I}}\n{{player3 | pos = C | num = 50 | nat = AUS | first = Mark | last =Bradtke | dab = AUS basketball | m = 2.08 | kgs = 120}}\n{{Basketball roster footer\n| head_coach =\n* {{player||AUS|Lindsey Gaze}}\n| asst_coach =\n* {{player||AUS|Al Westover}}\n| I = y\n}}\n\n=== Depth chart ===\n{{basketball depth chart\n| bench 3_label = Reserves\n| starter_c =  [[Mark Bradtke]]\n| bench 1_c =  [[Blair Smith]]\n| bench 2_c = \n| bench 3_c = \n| starter_pf =   [[Marcus Timmons]]\n| bench 1_pf =  [[Brett Jeffries]]\n| bench 2_pf =  \n| bench 3_pf =   [[Jarvis Lang]]\n| starter_sf =   [[Warrick Giddey]]\n| bench 1_sf =  [[Daniel Egan]]\n| bench 2_sf = \n| bench 3_sf =  \n| starter_sg =   [[Lanard Copeland]]\n| bench 1_sg =  [[Brett Rainbow]]\n| bench 2_sg = \n| bench 3_sg =  \n| starter_pg =   [[Andrew Gaze]]\n| bench 1_pg =   [[Ray Gordon]]\n| bench 2_pg =  [[Erik Wickstorm]]\n| bench 3_pg =  [[Daniel Chapman]]\n}}\n\n==Ladder==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=25|#\n!width=150|Team\n!width=40|Pld\n!width=40|W\n!width=40|L\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|[[South East Melbourne Magic]]\n|30\n|22\n|8\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|[[Melbourne Tigers]]\n|30\n|19\n|11\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|[[North Melbourne Giants]]\n|30\n|18\n|12\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|[[Perth Wildcats]]\n|30\n|17\n|13\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|[[Canberra Cannons]]\n|30\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|[[Brisbane Bullets]]\n|30\n|15\n|15\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|[[Townsville Crocodiles|Townsville Suns]]\n|30\n|14\n|16\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|[[Adelaide 36ers]]\n|30\n|14\n|16\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|[[Sydney Kings]]\n|30\n|12\n|18\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|[[Newcastle Falcons (basketball)|Newcastle Falcons]]\n|30\n|12\n|18\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|[[Wollongong Hawks|Illawarra Hawks]]\n|30\n|12\n|23\n|}\n\n==Player statistics==\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA roster statistics legend}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!

Melbourne decided to let go long time import Dave Simmons after eight years and one championship with the power forward. In Simmons' place they decided to sign import forward Jarvis Lang. Motivated by their loss of the year before, they looked to win it all in 1997.\n\nThe Tigers had a slow start to the season, starting off the season at 4-9 there was talk in the herald sun about sacking the teams long term head coach Lindsey Gaze, but soon after the article there were major changes but it wasn\u2019t the head coach who was let go it was the import Jarvis Lang who was dealing with knee soreness and struggling to learn the Melbourne tigers shuffle offense, in turn the tigers turned the season around by winning 16 straight games 17-1 during the end of the regular season and finals. This all was helped by the signing of Marcus Timmons, who added a punch both on the offensive and defensive side of the floor.  The Tigers went from second last at 4-9 on the ladder during the start of the season to end up finishing in second place at 19-11 having a run of 13 game winning streak to end the regular season. The tigers were meant to finish the regular season with a 20-10 record but because of some paper work that wasn\u2019t finalized, the league stripped the tigers of a win over in round 3 against the 36ers the tigers were furious that the league stripped them of the win to say the least. When fully healthy, the core of Gaze, Copeland, Timmons and Bradtke were 15-2 and 5-1 in the playoffs making this team one of the most dominant teams all of time. As expected, the team was led by Andrew Gaze, who had one of his best shooting seasons of his career, averaging just on 4 3 point field goals made making 143 for the season, whilst averaging his typical over 30 points per game and over 6 assists. Alongside him in the back court, Lanard Copeland averaged his typical over 22 points for the season, whilst big man Mark Bradtke anchored down low averaging 20 points over 12 rebounds. Warrick Giddey would provide a toughness and defence that he built his reputation on. Key bench players Ray Gordon and Blair Smith were solid players off the bench for the Tigers. After letting go of Jarvis Lang, they signed Marcus Timmons who had a terrific year helping the Tigers on both the offensive and defensive side of the floor averaging over 17 points and over 8 rebounds. Andrew Gaze would be named MVP and both he and Mark Bradtke would be named to All-First NBL team, whilst Andrew Gaze and Mark Bradtke were named to the all star game.\n\n===Semi-finals===\nAlong with the 1st placed [[South East Melbourne Magic]], the Tigers were given a bye in the quarter-finals. In their three-game semi-final against the 3rd placed [[North Melbourne Giants]] there was little resistance, sweeping them in two games. The Tigers would be moving on to their second consecutive grand final appearance. Andrew Gaze was outstanding in the semi-finals, averaging 36.5 points and 9.5 assists per game. Ahead of the Tigers was cross town rival South East Melbourne Magic, the same team that they had lost to the year before in the deciding game 3.\n\n==NBL grand final==\n\nThe Tigers' opponents in the 1997 NBL Grand Final would again be the South East Melbourne Magic who were the same team that beat the Tigers in the previous grand final in game 3. All 3 of the games would be held at Melbourne Park, game 3 if needed. Similar to the Tigers the Magic swept their previous round of the finals. There was a lot of hype for people to watch the best offensive team in the Melbourne Tigers vs the best defensive team in the South East, Melbourne Magic.\n\nGame 1 was a beat down from the Tigers, who were on full attack from the beginning, never trailing in the game and winning 111-74. Larand Copeland was the game's high scorer with 29, whilst Gaze added 23 and 9 assists. The Melbourne Tigers landed 3 pointers left right and centre whilst the bigs of Bradtke and Timmons controlled the paint. Frank Drimc was top scorer with 12 for the Magic.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?action=MATCH&fixture=500766159&client=0-189-12322-125723-369917 |title=National Basketball League (NBL) Match Centre - SportsTG |publisher=Websites.sportstg.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly to the year before after dropping the first game, Game 2 was a lot better for the Magic. They started veteran John Dorge over the young Chris Anstey. The Magic bounced back to beat the Tigers, winning the close game to even the series at 1-1 and forcing a game 3 for the second straight year against the Magic and Tigers. The scores were 84-78 with Chris Anstey bouncing back from an average game one dropping 21 points in game 2. Lanard Copeland was the Tigers' high scorer with 28.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?action=MATCH&fixture=500764221&client=0-189-12322-125723-369917 |title=National Basketball League (NBL) Match Centre - SportsTG |publisher=Websites.sportstg.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\nFor the second straight year the Melbourne Tigers played the South East Melbourne Magic in game 3 to decide who would win the championship. The Melbourne Tigers won the NBL championship with a score line of 93-83 in a tough hard fought game which in the end the tigers took control with the top scorer again being Larand Copeland with 26 points; Gaze added 22 and 9 assists. Lanard Copeland was named [[NBL Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] after having an amazing series averaging 28 points against the best defensive team in the league, there was no one on the magic who could stop lanard.\nNot only did winning this championship cement the tigers to being one of the greatest teams of all time but also made them one of the greatest clues in NBL history.\n\nTo top it all off with Andrew Gaze winning his second championship ring it would cement him to being the goat (greatest player of all time) of the NBL even to this day\n<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/round_info.cgi?action=MATCH&fixture=500767036&client=0-189-12322-125723-369917 |title=National Basketball League (NBL) Match Centre - SportsTG |publisher=Websites.sportstg.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\n===Game 1===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=October 25th |time=12:00 p.m. [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|EST]] |place=[[Melbourne Park]] |TV=[[TVQ|TV 0]] |referee=Bill Mildenhall, Ray Hunt, Scott Butler\n|team1=[[South East Melbourne Magic]] |score1=74\n|team2='''[[Melbourne Tigers]]''' |score2='''111'''\n|report=<ref name=\"auto\"/> Box score\n|Q1=20-'''29''' |Q2=17-'''32'''| |Q3=14-'''17'''|Q4=23-'''33'''|\n|points1=[[Frank Drimc]] 12\n|points2=[[Larnad Copeland]] 29\n|rebounds1=[[Frank Drimc]] 11\n|rebounds2=[[Mark Bradtke]] 9\n|assist1=[[Sam Mackinnon]] 4\n|assist2=[[Andrew Gaze]] 9\n|series=Melbourne leads series, 1&ndash;0\n}}\n\n===Game 2===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=October 29th |time=12:00 p.m. [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|EST]] |place=[[Melbourne Park]] |TV=[[TVQ|TV 0]] |referee=Bill Mildenhall,\nEddie Crouch, Michael Butler\n|team1=[[Melbourne Tigers]] |score1=78\n|team2='''[[South East Melbourne Magic]]''' |score2='''84'''\n|report=<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Box score\n|Q1='''25'''-21 |Q2=22-'''24''' |Q3=19-'''20''' |Q4=12-'''19'''\n|points1=[[Lanard Copeland]] 29\n|points2=[[Chris Anstey]] 21\n|rebounds1=[[Marcus timmons]] 12\n|rebounds2=[[Michael Kelly (basketball)|Mike Kelly]] 10\n|assist1=[[Andrew Gaze]] 5\n|assist2=[[Sam Mackinnon]] 6\n|series=Series tied, 1&ndash;1\n}}\n\n===Game 3===\n{{basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=September 1st |time=12:00 p.m. [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|EST]] |place=[[Melbourne Park]] |TV |referee=Bill Mildenhall\n, Ray Hunt, Scott Butler\n|team1=[[South East Melbourne Magic]] |score1=83\n|team2='''[[Melbourne Tigers]]''' |score2='''93'''\n|report=<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Box score\n|Q1=21-'''25''' |Q2=15-'''25'''| |Q3=19-'''20'''|Q4='''28'''-23|\n|points1=[[Tony Ronaldson]] 26\n|points2=[[Larnad Copeland]] 26\n|rebounds1=[[Frank Drimc]] 9\n|rebounds2=[[Marcus Timmons]] 13\n|assist1=[[Sam Mackinnon]] 6\n|assist2=[[Andrew Gaze]] 9\n|series=Melbourne wins series and NBL Championship, 2&ndash;1<br>Grand Final MVP: [[Lanard Copeland]] (Melbourne)\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*http://websites.sportstg.com/team_info.cgi?c=0-189-12322-125723-369917&a=STATS\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Warrick_Giddey/Australia/Werribee-Devils/8140\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Daniel_Egan/Australia/Townsville-Heat/9957\n*http://basketball.eurobasket.com/player/Brett_Jeffries/Sweden/Alvik-Basket-Stockholm/15749\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Erik-Wickstrom/Australia/Sandringham_Sabres/25312\n*https://www.tigersbasketball.com.au/20th-anniversary-of-melbourne-tigers-vba-championship-part-2/\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Brett_Rainbow/Australia/Ringwood-Hawks/12349\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Blair_Smith/Australia/Gladstone-Port-City-Power/12470\n*https://basketball.australiabasket.com/player/Marcus_Timmons/Australia/Hawthorn-Magic/24513\n\n[[Category:1997 in Australian basketball]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: an 19 \u2192 a 19, teams long term \u2192 team's long term", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Melbourne_Tigers_season"}
