It is the third installment in the [[Friday (film series)|''Friday'' series]]. The film was theatrically released on November 22, 2002, to minor box office success but generally negative reviews. This film has since gained a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins when a robber ([[Rickey Smiley]]), disguised as [[Santa Claus]], breaks into Craig ([[Ice Cube]]) and Day-Day's ([[Mike Epps]]) house at 3:37 AM on Christmas Eve. Craig fights with the robber, trashing their apartment while making frantic, futile attempts to wake Day-Day. The robber escapes with Craig and Day-Day's Christmas presents and rent money. The same morning, the police come over to get a report. \n\nAfter the police leave, Mrs. Pearly (Bebe Drake) comes in and says that if the two do not pay their rent money by the end of the day, she will evict them. Furthermore, she promises to send her [[homosexual]] [[ex-convict]] son, Damon ([[Terry Crews]]), who just got out of prison after 12 years, after them if they do not pay in a timely manner. The same day, Craig and Day-Day get jobs as \"Top Flight Security Guards\" from Moly ([[Maz Jobrani]]), the property manager and owner of a notoriously squalid doughnut shop and the shopping center that they are assigned to patrol. \n\nLater that day, they meet Donna ([[K.D. Aubert]]) and Money Mike ([[Katt Williams]]), who run a fledgling shop called 'Pimps and Hoes.' The shopping center is also the home of a BBQ rib restaurant called 'Bros. BBQ', owned by the cousins' fathers, Willie ([[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]) and Elroy ([[Don \"D.C.\" Curry]]). \n\nA couple of baseheads try to rob Money Mike's store, but Craig and Day-Day catch them both. Mike offers them a cash reward, but Craig refuses it and instead invites him to his Christmas party. Willie and Elroy are having trouble with some of the children. When one of them kicks Elroy, he retaliates by taking out a belt and starts a series of beatings on the kids. Then, shortly after Moly gives Craig and Day-Day a lunch break, a gang of thugs, supposedly the grandsons of some of the carolers that were chased off by Day-Day for loitering in front of the corner store, chase after Craig and Day-Day. After failing to catch them, they proceed to beat up Moly for supposedly hiding them, resulting in the two throwing away their uniforms after witnessing what happened to Moly, and ultimately getting unjustly fired from their jobs (due to Moly accusing them of lazing around and allowing him to be beaten, even though he'd just given them a lunch break). As revenge, Willie rats Moly out to the Department of Health.\n\nLater that night, Craig and Day-Day throw a [[rent party]] to recoup their stolen rent money and stay in their apartment. While Money Mike is in the bathroom, Damon tries to [[rape]] him, but fails when Money Mike crunches his testicles with pliers. Damon then proceeds to chase him when he tries to run away. Also Mrs. Pearly comes on to Willie when he uses her bathroom, causing Craig\u2019s mother, Betty ([[Anna Maria Horsford]]), to come in and attack her when she catches the two. Craig and Day-Day see the robber and give chase, running into other obstacles (including an elderly comedic but crazed gunman, played by Epps) and are ultimately successful after the robber gets run over by Pinky's limousine. \n\nThe movie ends with Craig and Day-Day retrieving their stolen rent money and Christmas presents and tying the robber up on his roof. During the credits, it is revealed that Craig and Donna hooked up after Craig returned, Damon is still chasing Money Mike throughout the neighborhood, and that Ms. Pearly tried to stop the party by calling the police, but they left after receiving marijuana as a bribe.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ice Cube]] &mdash; Craig Jones / Narrator\n*[[Mike Epps]] &mdash; Day-Day Jones / Old Man with Shotgun\n*[[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] &mdash; Mr. Willie Jones\n*[[Don 'D.C.'

One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the [[international financial institutions]] that supported them, such as the [[World Bank]].

The method sought to integrate the concerns and experiences of three rural communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana into official [[forest management]] practices.<ref name=Kyem /> Kyem<ref name=Kyem /> concluded that, notwithstanding  the potential of PPGIS, it is possible that the majority of the rich and powerful people in the area would object to some of the participatory uses of [[GIS]]. For example, loggers in Ghana affirmed that the PPGIS procedures were too open and democratic.<ref name=Kyem /> Thus, despite its democratising potential, there are barriers to its implementation. More recently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al''.<ref name=Wood />  disputed the notion of PPGIS entirely, affirming that it is \"scarcely [[GIS]], intensely hegemonic, hardly public, and anything but participatory\".\n\n== Counter-mapping as governance ==\n[[Governance]] makes problematic state-centric notions of regulation, recognising that there has been a shift to power operating across several [[spatial scales]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bridge|first=G|title=A Companion to Environmental Geography|year=2009|author2=Perreault, T|editor=Castree, N.M |editor2=Demeritt, D. |editor3=Liverman, D. |editor4=Rhoads, B|pages=475\u2013497|chapter=Environmental Governance}}</ref> Similarly, counter-mapping complicates state distribution of [[cartography]], advocating [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] participatory mapping projects (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]).

For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation.<ref name=Alcorn /> For example, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz.<ref name=Alcorn /> The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn<ref name=Alcorn />  to affirm that [[governance]] ([[grassroots]] mapping projects), rather than government ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]] map distribution), offers the best hope for good [[natural resource management]]. In short, it can be seen that \"maps are powerful political tools in ecological and governance discussions\".<ref name=Alcorn />\n\n== Types of counter-mapping ==\nNumerous counter-mapping types exist, for instance: protest maps, map art, counter-mapping for conservation, and [[PPGIS]]. In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.\n\n=== Indigenous counter-mapping ===\nCounter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World.<ref name=\"perkins\">{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|title=Community Mapping|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127\u2013137|doi=10.1179/000870407x213440|year=2007}}</ref> [[Indigenous peoples]] are increasingly turning to [[participatory]] mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=J|author2=Bryan, J|title=Cartography, Territory, Property: Postcolonial Reflections on Indigenous Counter-Mapping in Nicaragua and Belize|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=153\u2013187|doi=10.1177/1474474008101515|hdl=1811/52137}}</ref> Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.J|title=Naming the Land: San Countermapping in Namibia's West Caprivi|journal=Geoforum|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1766\u20131775|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.04.001}}</ref> and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims.<ref name=Peluso /> The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's<ref>{{cite journal|last=Neitschmann|first=B|title=Defending the Misiko Reefs with Maps and GIS: Mapping with Sail, Scuba and Satellite|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=34\u201337}}</ref> assertion:\n{{quote box |quote = ''More indigenous territory has been claimed by maps than by guns.

In 1967, [[Frank Arthur Calder]] and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the [[Province of British Columbia]] for a declaration that [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating [[treaties]] with the people who had not signed them.<ref name=Wood /> As a first step, the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] studied [[Inuit]] land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the ''Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=M.M.R|title=Land Use and Occupancy, Vol. 1 of Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project Report|year=1976|location=Ottawa}}</ref> Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives.<ref name=Wood /> As Usher<ref>{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=P.J|title=Environment, Race and Nation Reconsidered: Reflections on Aboriginal Land Claims in Canada|journal=Canadian Geographer|year=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=365\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.0008-3658.2003.00029.x}}</ref> noted:\n\n{{quote box |quote = ''We were no longer mapping the 'territories' of Aboriginal people based on the cumulative observations of others of where they were\u2026but instead, mapping the Aboriginal peoples\u2019 own recollections of their own activities''.\n|align  = left\n|bgcolor =#FFF8E7\n |quoted = 1\n}}\n\nThese maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km\u00b2 in Canada, today known as Nunavut.<ref name=Wood /> Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kwan|first=M|title=Feminist Visualisation: Re-Envisioning GIS as a Method in Feminist Geographic Research|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=92|issue=4|pages=645\u2013661|doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00309|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.1027.5622}}</ref> \n\nIndigenous peoples have begun remapping areas of the world that were once occupied by their ancestors as an act of reclamation of land stolen from them by country governments. Indigenous peoples have begun this process all over the world from the Indigenous peoples from the United States, Aboriginal peoples from Australia, and Amazonian people from Brazil. The people of the lands have begun creating their own maps of the land in terms of the borders of the territory and pathways around the territory. When Native peoples first began this process it was done by hand, but presently GPS systems and other technological mapping devices are used<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-amazonian-forest-peoples-are-counter-mapping-their-ancestral-lands-84474|title=Why Amazonian forest peoples are 'counter-mapping' their ancestral lands|last=Fraser|first=James A.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>. Indigenous maps are reconceptualizing the \"average\" map and creatively representing space as well as the culture of those who live in the space. Indigenous people are creating maps that are for their power and social benefit instead of the ones forced on them through different titling, and description. Indigenous peoples are also creating maps to adjust to the contamination and pollution that is present In their land. Specifically in Peru, Indigenous peoples are using mapping to identify problem areas and innovating and creating strategies to combat these risks for the future<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.utexas.edu/participatory-mapping/files/2012/12/Portal_Participatory-Mapping_2012.pdf|title=Indigenous Rights, Insurgent Cartographies, and the Promise of Participatory Mapping}}</ref>. \n\n===== Perspectives on the Land (United States) =====\nWhite colonists saw land as property and a commodity to be possessed. As a result, as settlers grew in numbers and journeyed west, land was claimed and sold for profit. White colonists would \u201cdevelop\u201d the land and take ownership of it, believing the land was theirs to own. Indigenous peoples, on the other hand, saw themselves as connected with the land spiritually and that the land, instead owned them. Land to Aboriginal people is a major part of their identity and spirituality. They saw the land as being sacred and needing to be protected. Indigenous peoples believe it is their responsibility to take care of the land. As Marion Kickett states in her research, \u201cLand is very important to Aboriginal people with the common belief of 'we don\u2019t own the land, the land owns us'. Aboriginal people have always had a spiritual connection to their land...<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharingculture.info/the-importance-of-land.html|title=The Importance of Land|website=Sharing Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\" These differing perspectives on land caused many disputes during the era of Manifest Destiny and as white settler populations began to increase and move into Indigenous peoples\u2019 territory. The Indigenous people believed they were to serve the land while white colonists believed the land should serve them. As a result, when the two sides came in contact, they disputed over how to \"claim\" land. The height of this conflict began to occur during [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]<nowiki/>as the white colonist population began to grow and move westward into more parts of Indigenous lands and communities.\n\n===== The Process of Mapping (United States) =====\nMaps represent and reflect how an individual or society names and projects themselves onto nature, literally and symbolically. Mapping, while seemingly objective is political and a method of control on territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-amazonian-forest-peoples-are-counter-mapping-their-ancestral-lands-84474|title=Why Amazonian forest peoples are 'counter-mapping' their ancestral lands|last=Fraser|first=James A.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>Mapmaking has thus both socio-cultural (myth-making) and technical (utilitarian and economic) functions and traditions<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aughty.org/pdf/community_mapping.pdf|title=Community Mapping}}</ref>. The difference between boundaries and territories made by the White colonists and Indigenous people were vastly different, and expressed their views on the land and nature. Indigenous peoples' territory often ended at rivers, mountains, and hills or were defined by relationships between different tribes, resources, and trade networks. The relationships between tribes would determine the access to the land and its resources. Instead of the borders being hard edges like the United States\u2019, border on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands were more fluid and would change based on marriages between chiefs and their family members, hunting clans, and heredity. In Indigenous maps the landmarks would be drawn on paper and in some cases described. Detailed knowledge of the thickness of ice, places of shelter and predators were placed in maps to inform the user for what to look for when in the territory. \n\nMaps made by White colonists in America were first based on populations, created territories based on the edges of civilization. After the creation of the United States government, state land was designated by Congress and intended to be given equally by latitude and longitudinal coordinates. The \u00a0ending of railroad tracks and crossings also designated the ending of one state to another, creating a fence-like boundary. In a special case, after the acquisition of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the United States had to decide between the territory where slavery was legal and where it was not. The [[Missouri Compromise]]<nowiki/>was birthed as a result and a boundary line was created at the longitude and latitude lines of 36\u201930\u201d. The states were documented by their coordinates and borders were made at the numbered locations. These numbered locations would stretch for miles and encompass all in that territory even if it belonged to Indigenous peoples\u2019. That is often how land would be stolen from Indigenous peoples. The land that would be \"claimed\" by the United States Government would stretch across Indigenous lands without consideration of their borders. Indigenous peoples' lands were absorbed by the borders of America's newly mapped states and were forced out as a result. Their livelihoods and mythology tied to the land was also destroyed. White colonists claimed the land for their own and Indigenous peoples were no longer allowed to occupy the space. Another way was the differences in the way each group mapped the land. The United States Government would not recognize a Tribes territory without a map and most tribes did not have maps that were in the style of European maps, therefore they were ignored.\n\n=== Community mapping ===\n[[Community]] mapping can be defined as: \"local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative\nlocal knowledge\".<ref name=perkins /> [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap] is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elwood|first=S|title=Citizen Cartographies and the Shifting Politics of Expertise.

This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them.<ref name=Peluso /> The other set of maps had been created by Indonesian [[NGOs]], who often contract international experts to assist with mapping village territories.<ref name=Peluso /> The goal of the second set of maps was to co-opt the cartographic conventions of the Indonesian state, to legitimise the claims by the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] people, indigenous to Kalimantan, to the rights to forest use.<ref name=Rundstrom />  Counter-mappers in Kalimantan have acquired [[GIS]] technologies, satellite technology, and computerised [[resource management]] tools, consequently  making the Indonesian state vulnerable to counter-maps.<ref name=Peluso /> As such, counter-mapping strategies in Kalimantan have led to successful community action to block, and protest against, oil palm plantations and logging concessions imposed by the central government.<ref name=Peluso />\n\nIt must, however, be recognised that counter-mapping projects existed long before coinage of the term.<ref name=\"Rundstrom\">{{cite book|last=Rundstrom|first=R|title=Counter-Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=314\u2013318|doi=10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00017-1|isbn=9780080449104}}</ref> Counter-maps are rooted in map art practices that date to the early 20th century; in the [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] movement of the 1960s; in indigenous and bioregional mapping; and parish mapping.<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=Rethinking the Power of Maps|year=2010|publisher=Guilford Press|location=London |author2=Fels, J. |author3=Krygier, J}}</ref>\n\n=== Parish Maps Project ===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parish Map.jpg|thumb|right|text-top|border|alt=Salle parish map.|Salle parish map.]] -->In 1985, the charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] launched the [[Parish Maps Project]], a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] initiative encouraging local people to map elements of the environment valued by their [[parish]].<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=A|title=Holding Your Ground: An Action Guide to Local Conservation|year=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|author2=Clifford, S}}</ref> Since then, more than 2,500 English parishes have made such maps.<ref name=Wood /> Parish mapping projects aim to put every local person in an 'expert' role.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberley|first=D|title=Boundaries of Home: Mapping for Local Empowerment|year=1993|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> Clifford<ref>{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=S|title=From Place to Place: Maps and Parish Maps|year=1996|publisher=Common Ground|location=London|pages=3\u20137|editor=Clifford, S. |editor2=King, A.|chapter=Places, People, and Parish Maps}}</ref> exemplifies this notion, affirming: \"making a parish map is about creating a community expression of values, and about beginning to assert ideas for involvement.

For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation.<ref name=Alcorn /> For example, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz.<ref name=Alcorn /> The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn<ref name=Alcorn />  to affirm that [[governance]] ([[grassroots]] mapping projects), rather than government ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]] map distribution), offers the best hope for good [[natural resource management]].

In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.\n\n=== Indigenous counter-mapping ===\nCounter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World.<ref name=\"perkins\">{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|title=Community Mapping|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127\u2013137|doi=10.1179/000870407x213440|year=2007}}</ref> [[Indigenous peoples]] are increasingly turning to [[participatory]] mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=J|author2=Bryan, J|title=Cartography, Territory, Property: Postcolonial Reflections on Indigenous Counter-Mapping in Nicaragua and Belize|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=153\u2013187|doi=10.1177/1474474008101515|hdl=1811/52137}}</ref> Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.J|title=Naming the Land: San Countermapping in Namibia's West Caprivi|journal=Geoforum|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1766\u20131775|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.04.001}}</ref> and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims.<ref name=Peluso /> The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's<ref>{{cite journal|last=Neitschmann|first=B|title=Defending the Misiko Reefs with Maps and GIS: Mapping with Sail, Scuba and Satellite|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=34\u201337}}</ref> assertion:\n{{quote box |quote = ''More indigenous territory has been claimed by maps than by guns.

In 1967, [[Frank Arthur Calder]] and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the [[Province of British Columbia]] for a declaration that [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating [[treaties]] with the people who had not signed them.<ref name=Wood /> As a first step, the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] studied [[Inuit]] land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the ''Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=M.M.R|title=Land Use and Occupancy, Vol. 1 of Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project Report|year=1976|location=Ottawa}}</ref> Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives.<ref name=Wood /> As Usher<ref>{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=P.J|title=Environment, Race and Nation Reconsidered: Reflections on Aboriginal Land Claims in Canada|journal=Canadian Geographer|year=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=365\u2013382|doi=10.1111/j.0008-3658.2003.00029.x}}</ref> noted:\n\n{{quote box |quote = ''We were no longer mapping the 'territories' of Aboriginal people based on the cumulative observations of others of where they were\u2026but instead, mapping the Aboriginal peoples\u2019 own recollections of their own activities''.\n|align  = left\n|bgcolor =#FFF8E7\n |quoted = 1\n}}\n\nThese maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km\u00b2 in Canada, today known as Nunavut.<ref name=Wood /> Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kwan|first=M|title=Feminist Visualisation: Re-Envisioning GIS as a Method in Feminist Geographic Research|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=92|issue=4|pages=645\u2013661|doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00309|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.1027.5622}}</ref> \n\nIndigenous peoples have begun remapping areas of the world that were once occupied by their ancestors as an act of reclamation of land stolen from them by country governments. Indigenous peoples have begun this process all over the world from the Indigenous peoples from the United States, Aboriginal peoples from Australia, and Amazonian people from Brazil. The people of the lands have begun creating their own maps of the land in terms of the borders of the territory and pathways around the territory. When Native peoples first began this process it was done by hand, but presently GPS systems and other technological mapping devices are used<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-amazonian-forest-peoples-are-counter-mapping-their-ancestral-lands-84474|title=Why Amazonian forest peoples are 'counter-mapping' their ancestral lands|last=Fraser|first=James A.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>. Indigenous maps are reconceptualizing the \"average\" map and creatively representing space as well as the culture of those who live in the space. Indigenous people are creating maps that are for their power and social benefit instead of the ones forced on them through different titling, and description. Indigenous peoples are also creating maps to adjust to the contamination and pollution that is present In their land. Specifically in Peru, Indigenous peoples are using mapping to identify problem areas and innovating and creating strategies to combat these risks for the future<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.utexas.edu/participatory-mapping/files/2012/12/Portal_Participatory-Mapping_2012.pdf|title=Indigenous Rights, Insurgent Cartographies, and the Promise of Participatory Mapping}}</ref>. \n\n===== Perspectives on the Land (United States) =====\nWhite colonists saw land as property and a commodity to be possessed. As a result, as settlers grew in numbers and journeyed west, land was claimed and sold for profit. White colonists would \u201cdevelop\u201d the land and take ownership of it, believing the land was theirs to own. Indigenous peoples, on the other hand, saw themselves as connected with the land spiritually and that the land, instead owned them. Land to Aboriginal people is a major part of their identity and spirituality. They saw the land as being sacred and needing to be protected. Indigenous peoples believe it is their responsibility to take care of the land. As Marion Kickett states in her research, \u201cLand is very important to Aboriginal people with the common belief of 'we don\u2019t own the land, the land owns us'. Aboriginal people have always had a spiritual connection to their land...<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharingculture.info/the-importance-of-land.html|title=The Importance of Land|website=Sharing Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\" These differing perspectives on land caused many disputes during the era of Manifest Destiny and as white settler populations began to increase and move into Indigenous peoples\u2019 territory. The Indigenous people believed they were to serve the land while white colonists believed the land should serve them. As a result, when the two sides came in contact, they disputed over how to \"claim\" land. The height of this conflict began to occur during [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]<nowiki/>as the white colonist population began to grow and move westward into more parts of Indigenous lands and communities.\n\n===== The Process of Mapping (United States) =====\nMaps represent and reflect how an individual or society names and projects themselves onto nature, literally and symbolically. Mapping, while seemingly objective is political and a method of control on territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-amazonian-forest-peoples-are-counter-mapping-their-ancestral-lands-84474|title=Why Amazonian forest peoples are 'counter-mapping' their ancestral lands|last=Fraser|first=James A.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>Mapmaking has thus both socio-cultural (myth-making) and technical (utilitarian and economic) functions and traditions<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aughty.org/pdf/community_mapping.pdf|title=Community Mapping}}</ref>. The difference between boundaries and territories made by the White colonists and Indigenous people were vastly different, and expressed their views on the land and nature. Indigenous peoples' territory often ended at rivers, mountains, and hills or were defined by relationships between different tribes, resources, and trade networks. The relationships between tribes would determine the access to the land and its resources. Instead of the borders being hard edges like the United States\u2019, border on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands were more fluid and would change based on marriages between chiefs and their family members, hunting clans, and heredity. In Indigenous maps the landmarks would be drawn on paper and in some cases described. Detailed knowledge of the thickness of ice, places of shelter and predators were placed in maps to inform the user for what to look for when in the territory. \n\nMaps made by White colonists in America were first based on populations, created territories based on the edges of civilization. After the creation of the United States government, state land was designated by Congress and intended to be given equally by latitude and longitudinal coordinates. The \u00a0ending of railroad tracks and crossings also designated the ending of one state to another, creating a fence-like boundary. In a special case, after the acquisition of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the United States had to decide between the territory where slavery was legal and where it was not. The [[Missouri Compromise]]<nowiki/>was birthed as a result and a boundary line was created at the longitude and latitude lines of 36\u201930\u201d. The states were documented by their coordinates and borders were made at the numbered locations. These numbered locations would stretch for miles and encompass all in that territory even if it belonged to Indigenous peoples\u2019. That is often how land would be stolen from Indigenous peoples. The land that would be \"claimed\" by the United States Government would stretch across Indigenous lands without consideration of their borders. Indigenous peoples' lands were absorbed by the borders of America's newly mapped states and were forced out as a result. Their livelihoods and mythology tied to the land was also destroyed. White colonists claimed the land for their own and Indigenous peoples were no longer allowed to occupy the space. Another way was the differences in the way each group mapped the land. The United States Government would not recognize a Tribes territory without a map and most tribes did not have maps that were in the style of European maps, therefore they were ignored.\n\n=== Community mapping ===\n[[Community]] mapping can be defined as: \"local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative\nlocal knowledge\".<ref name=perkins /> [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap] is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elwood|first=S|title=Citizen Cartographies and the Shifting Politics of Expertise.

This form of counter-mapping thus represents a claim by a relatively weak state, East Timor, to territory and resources that are controlled by a stronger state, Australia.<ref name=Rundstrom /> However, Nevins<ref name=Nevins /> notes that there is limited potential of realising a claim through East Timor's counter-map: counter-mapping is an effective strategy only when combined with broader legal and political strategies.<ref name=Nevins />\n\n== Criticisms ==\nCounter-mapping's claim to incorporate counter-knowledges, and thereby empower traditionally disempowered people, has not gone uncontested.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turow|first=J|title=Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling, and Medical Power|year=2010|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan}}</ref> A sample of criticisms leveled at counter-mapping:\n\n* Counter-mapping fails to recognise that community is a constantly shifting, fluid process, too often relying on a notion of community as bounded and fixed.

Hated by [[Jim Fenner]] ([[Jack Ellis (actor)|Jack Ellis]]), Nikki is respected by most of the other inmates apart from [[Shell Dockley]] ([[Debra Stephenson]]). The pair frequently clash over Shell's relationship with Fenner and the fact that Nikki is not at all impressed or intimidated by Shell. After being dumped by Trisha, Nikki falls for Helen, but their relationship has many ups and downs. Nikki escapes from Larkhall in the Series 2 finale and the pair finally make love. However, Helen refuses to run away with Nikki and returns her to prison and ends their relationship. Nikki organises a peaceful protest when some of the officers brutally restrain Femi Bada, a non-English speaking inmate that is separated from her kids. This soon escalates into a riot and Helen ends their relationship once again but continues to help her with her appeal.

In the next series, Joy is helped to run Larkhall by new Deputy Governor [[#Lou Stoke|Lou Stoke]] ([[Amanda Donohoe]]). She bad-mouths Neil to Lou, unaware that Lou and Neil already know each other. When Neil has enough of Joy's orders, he threatens to walk out of his job and, when nobody can find him, they all believe he has resigned. There is a shock, however, when Lou finds him dead on the floor of his office after catching [[Legionnaires' disease]]. When the other prison officers learn of the disease in Larkhall, they madly race out of the building, knocking Joy unconscious and trampling on her. Joy later regains consciousness, and is stunned when she witnesses all of G-Wing's prisoners escaping. They are all ordered back inside the prison, but Phyl is shot when she attempts to run away.\n\nLater on in the series, new inmate [[#Stella Gough|Stella Gough]] ([[Helen Modern]]) pleases Joy when she tells her she wants to join the army, and she sustains a nasty fall when she tries to show Joy just how much she wants to be in the army. While she is in the hospital, Stella reveals that she knows Joy is her mother, and Joy is stunned to know that she has been reunited with her daughter. Stella reveals that she knows why Joy gave her up for adoption, she had told Social Services that she was raped, when it was actually a drunken one-night stand. Stella confides in Joy saying that she too was also raped. When Joy sees Stella being attacked by [[#Darlene Cake|Darlene Cake]] ([[Antonia Okonma]]) and [[#Tina O'Kane|Tina O'Kane]] ([[Victoria Bush]]), she steps in and is punched in the stomach by Darlene. Joy then reveals the awful truth to Stella that she was not raped, and that she just drunkenly had sex while she was in the army. Stella then attacks Joy with a smashed glasses lens attached to a toothbrush, and new prison officer [[#Mandy Goodhue|Mandy Goodhue]] ([[Angela Bruce]]) saves her. Joy then takes optional leave when she turns to alcohol for comfort. When she returns, she has to deal with the fact that [[#Janine Nebeski|Janine Nebeski]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) has now fallen pregnant. Janine tells Joy that her boyfriend, \"Michael\", is responsible, but the biological father is in fact prison officer, [[#Donny Kimber|Donny Kimber]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Joy discovers this and threatens to fire him. When Darlene sets fire to herself on the landing of G-Wing, Donny puts her out and Joy congratulates Donny for his quick-thinking, and she says that he is allowed to keep his job. Joy is not seen after this.\n\n===Kevin Spiers===\n\n*Portrayed by [[Andrew Scarborough]]\n*Duration: 7\n\n'''Kevin Spiers''' was introduced as a replacement for [[#Colin Hedges|Colin Hedges]] (Tristan Surrock). Kevin shows many aspects of [[Jim Fenner]] ([[Jack Ellis (actor)|Jack Ellis]]) in him; having sexual relationships with some of the inmates and turning violent when they take advantage of him. When Fenner is murdered, Kevin becomes a suspect after their friendship became frosty towards the end of his life. The real culprit was in fact [[#Julie Saunders & Julie Johnston|Julie Johnston]] ([[Kika Mirylees]]). Kevin begins having sex with nonce [[Natalie Buxton]] ([[Dannielle Brent]]), but she is only using him for her \"weekend out\". Kevin is about to escort Natalie on the weekend out, but when the alarms go off following [[#Bev Tull|Bev Tull]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) and [[#Phyl Oswyn|Phyl Oswyn]]'s ([[Stephanie Beacham]]) escapes, it is postponed. When the weekend out eventually arrives, Natalie and Kevin have sex yet again, but things turn sour when she sprays Kevin in the eyes with a can of mace, and she plans to make her great escape. Unfortunately for Natalie, new G-Wing Top Dog [[#Pat Kerrigan|Pat Kerrigan]] ([[Liz May Brice]]) has organised a mob to be waiting outside her hotel to attack her, and she is slapped across the face. Kevin then saves Natalie and their relationship begins yet again. When in the chapal, Kevin and Natalie are caught having [[anal sex]] by Chaplain. Christy Mackay (Gaynor Howe). Kevin orders for Natalie to stop Christy from telling Larkhall Governor [[#Joy Masterton|Joy Masterton]] ([[Ellie Haddington]]), so she manipulates mentally ill inmate Miranda Miles (Nicola Redmond) into murdering Christy with a sharpened cross. When Kevin and Joy find Christy's corpse in the shower, they immediately send Miranda to a psychiatric hospital. Kevin is last seen looking worried after Natalie tells him that she manipulated Miranda into killing Christy.\n\n==Series 8==\n\n===Lou Stoke===\n\n*Portrayed by [[Amanda Donohoe]]\n*Duration: 8\n\n'''Louise \"Lou\" Stoke''' is hired as G Wing Governor of Larkhall to help out [[#Joy Masterton|Joy Masterton]] ([[Ellie Haddington]]). She instantly makes herself noticed by the inmates, and has a kind and sensitive side to her. Joy bad-mouths Wing Governor [[#Neil Grayling|Neil Grayling]] ([[James Gaddas]]) to Lou, unaware that Neil and Lou already know each other. Lou is later stunned when she finds Neil dead on the floor of his office following the sudden outbreak of [[Legionnaires' disease]]. Following the prisoners' escape after the sudden outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, Lou and [[#Dr. Rowan Dunlop|Dr. Rowan Dunlop]] ([[Colin Salmon]]) help [[#Tina O'Kane|Tina O'Kane]] ([[Victoria Bush]]) as she is seriously ill after catching the disease. In the next episode, Lou and Rowan get much closer and end up having sex in the bathroom. New disturbing inmate Angela Robbins ([[Annette Badland]]) shows signs of [[dissociative identity disorder]], and when Lou is escorting her to Rowan's office for a health check-up, Angela attacks Lou violently. After Lou punches Angela across the face, she begins to show a more caring and frightened side to her. Rowan diagnoses Angela with dissociative identity disorder and the pair have her shipped out of Larkhall. Lou then meets a young woman at the gates of Larkhall and they talk about somebody who Lou is close with. It later transpires to be her younger sister, Vicky (Melanie Cameron). Lou finds Vicky at a strip club, where they exchange insults and a catfight erupts between the two. Lou feels embarrassed when she realises that Rowan has witnessed the fight. Later on, Lou invites Rowan to her flat for dinner, to which he gladly accepts. During their meal, Vicky turns up and collapses, and it is soon revealed that she has attempted to commit suicide. When Vicky regains consciousness, she clashes with Lou about the situation and she warns her about Rowan. When Lou discovers that a young girl, Vanessa Andrews, is being used to smuggle drugs into prisons using her vagina, she confronts nonce [[Natalie Buxton]] ([[Dannielle Brent]]) about it, after [[#Pat Kerrigan|Pat Kerrigan]] ([[Liz May Brice]]) grasses her up. Natalie acts as if she knows nothing about Vanessa, so Lou cannot charge her.\n\n===Dr. Rowan Dunlop===\n\n*Portrayed by [[Colin Salmon]]\n*Duration: 8\n\n'''Dr. Rowan Dunlop''' makes his first appearance in the first episode of Series 8, as a replacement doctor for the late [[#Malcolm Nicholson|Dr. Malcolm Nicholson]] ([[Philip McGough]]).

All of the prison officers escape, along with some of the prisoners, and only Rowan, Tina, [[#Lou Stoke|Lou Stoke]] ([[Amanda Donohoe]]) and [[#Pat Kerrigan|Pat Kerrigan]] ([[Liz May Brice]]) are left in the building. Outside, [[#Phyl Oswyn|Phyl Oswyn]] ([[Stephanie Beacham]]) is shot when she attempts to run away, and Rowan informs her that if the bullet would have gone any deeper into her stomach, she would've died. Phyl pretends to show signs of [[paranoia]], and tells her partner-in-crime [[#Bev Tull|Bev Tull]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) that she is faking her symptoms. They later discover that Rowan is secretly working for a television series called ''Women Inside'', so Phyl and Bev blackmail Rowan into allowing Phyl into going to a professional hospital, otherwise they'll tell Governing Governor [[#Joy Masterton|Joy Masterton]] ([[Ellie Haddington]]) about his schemes. Rowan gives in and sends Phyl to hospital. Rowan and Lou later get intimate and they have sex in the bathroom of G-Wing. Swiftly after, Rowan witnesses Lou's catfight with her younger sister, Vicky (Melanie Cameron), in a strip club, leaving Lou embarrassed. When Lou invites Rowan to her flat for dinner, he delightedly accepts, and reveals that he is married. During their meal, Vicky arrives and collapses after attempting to commit suicide.  Dr Dunlop gets his comeuppance when Lou finds out that he has been feeding her sister Vicky drugs, and lured her into taking another overdose.  He was planning on letting her die, but is forced to act when discovered at the last minute.  Vicky confesses all to Lou on the way to hospital, and she returns to Larkhall long enough to smacks him in the head with a paperweight.  She is forced to leave Larkhall by Joy Masters.\n\n===Mandy Goodhue===\n\n*Portrayed by [[Angela Bruce]]\n*Duration: 8\n\n'''Mandy Goodhue''' is first seen patrolling around G-Wing as a new prison officer.

He was labeled the next [[Miodrag Belodedici]], but he was plagued by injuries and never really managed to progress. His subsequent career saw him play for [[Timi\u0219oara]] based teams, such as CFR and Poli, before moving on to FC One\u0219ti and ending his career at [[FC Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Drobeta-Turnu Severin]].\n\nHe started his manager career at the Divizia C team Telecom Timi\u0219oara. In 2004, he became the assistant of [[Gheorghe Mul\u021bescu]] at [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]] and later on, in autumn 2004, the team's head coach. He continued his career as assistant and afterwards as head coach of [[FC Unirea Alba Iulia|Apulum Alba Iulia]] in Divizia A. After a short stint as manager at [[FC Bihor Oradea|Bihor Oradea]] in Divizia B in 2005, Artimon was recruited in summer 2006 at Poli as a youth-supervisor. He received his big opportunity when being offered the manager position at the club after [[Sorin C\u00eer\u0163u]]'s release on 23 October 2006. While initially viewed only as a temporary solution, a good streak of results meant that he would be given the chance to lead the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nHowever, on 5 March 2007, Artimon resigned from his position as manager, stating that he did not wish to continue to work for the club if his efforts remain unappreciated. The resignation came just two days after a draw against [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucure\u015fti]], when Poli used the second team in protest against a two-match ban received by [[Artavazd Karamyan]]. On the 26th of March 2007 he became the manager of the Divizia B team [[FC CFR Timi\u0219oara|CFR Timi\u0219oara]].

In 2004, he became the assistant of [[Gheorghe Mul\u021bescu]] at [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]] and later on, in autumn 2004, the team's head coach. He continued his career as assistant and afterwards as head coach of [[FC Unirea Alba Iulia|Apulum Alba Iulia]] in Divizia A. After a short stint as manager at [[FC Bihor Oradea|Bihor Oradea]] in Divizia B in 2005, Artimon was recruited in summer 2006 at Poli as a youth-supervisor. He received his big opportunity when being offered the manager position at the club after [[Sorin C\u00eer\u0163u]]'s release on 23 October 2006. While initially viewed only as a temporary solution, a good streak of results meant that he would be given the chance to lead the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nHowever, on 5 March 2007, Artimon resigned from his position as manager, stating that he did not wish to continue to work for the club if his efforts remain unappreciated. The resignation came just two days after a draw against [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucure\u015fti]], when Poli used the second team in protest against a two-match ban received by [[Artavazd Karamyan]]. On the 26th of March 2007 he became the manager of the Divizia B team [[FC CFR Timi\u0219oara|CFR Timi\u0219oara]]. In September 2008 he replaced [[Nikola Ilievski]] as manager at [[CSM R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea]].<ref>[http://www.bihon.ro/stiri/sport-local/articol/noua-antrenori-demisi-in-seria-a-ii-a/cn/news-20080930-03330934]</ref> On 30 July 2010, Artimon followed [[Sebi Tudor]] as manager at [[FC Juventus Bucure\u015fti (1992)|Juventus Bucure\u015fti]].<ref>[http://liga2.prosport.ro/seria-1/alin-artimon-este-noul-antrenor-al-lui-juventus-6747354]</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{RomanianSoccer|85/danut-alin-artimon.htm}}\n*{{Soccerway|154725}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Alin Artimon \u2013 Managerial positions\n|list1=\n{{FC Politehnica Timi\u015foara managers}}\n{{SC Juventus Bucure\u0219ti managers}}\n{{FC Bihor Oradea managers}}\n{{FC Farul Constan\u021ba managers}}\n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Artimon, Alin}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Timi\u0219oara]]\n[[Category:Romanian footballers]]\n[[Category:FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti players]]\n[[Category:FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara players]]\n[[Category:ACF Gloria Bistri\u021ba players]]\n[[Category:FC Drobeta-Turnu Severin players]]\n[[Category:FC CFR Timi\u0219oara players]]\n[[Category:Liga I players]]\n[[Category:Liga II players]]\n[[Category:Romanian football managers]]\n[[Category:FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara managers]]\n[[Category:FC Unirea Alba Iulia managers]]\n[[Category:FC Bihor Oradea managers]]\n[[Category:ASC Daco-Getica Bucure\u0219ti managers]]\n[[Category:FC Farul Constan\u021ba managers]]\n[[Category:Association football defenders]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Timi\u0219oara(viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alin_Artimon"}

Its name is synonymous with the [[Irish Republican|republican]] community in the city, whilst the neighbouring [[Shankill Road]] is predominantly [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]], separated from Falls Road by [[peace lines]]. The road is usually referred to as ''the'' Falls Road, rather than as Falls Road. It is known as the ''Faas Raa'' in [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]].<ref>[http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm Language/Cultural Diversity \u2013 Irish Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107052142/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm |date=7 November 2012 }}, dcalni.gov.uk; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Falls rd, Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|The view from the Falls Road to the city centre, 1981]]\nThe Falls Road derives its name from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[t\u00faath]] na bhF\u00e1l'', an Irish [[petty kingdom]] whose name means \"territory of the enclosures\".<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> This territory was roughly the same as that of the [[ecclesiastical parish]] of the Shankill, which spanned a large portion of modern-day Belfast.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/>\n\nThe Falls Road itself was originally a country lane leading from the city centre but the population of the area expanded rapidly in the 19th century with the construction of several large [[linen]] mills. All of these have now closed or have been repurposed. This original area, which was centred on the junction of modern-day Millfield and College Avenue on what is now Divis Street, was known as Falls and lent its name to the road.<ref>[http://joegraham.rushlightmagazine.com/ Belfast History], rushlightmagazine.com; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> which had previously been called ''The Pound''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Old Pound Loney|url=http://oldbelfastdistricts.rushlightmagazine.com/loney.html|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> The housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. The [[Westlink (road)|Westlink]] linking the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] and [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] motorways now cuts through this area. \n\nThe short stretch of road linking Divis Street to the city centre is known as Castle Street after the original [[Belfast Castle]] which was built nearby by the [[Normans]] in the 12th century. Near the bottom of Castle Street is located Chapel Lane on which [[St Mary's Church, Belfast|St. Mary\u2019s Church]] is situated. This is the oldest [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church in Belfast and dates from 1784. \n\nThe Falls Road forms the first three miles of the A501 which starts in Belfast city centre and runs southwest through the city forking just after the Falls Park into the B102 which continues for a short distance to [[Andersonstown]]. The A501 continues as the Glen Road. The area is composed largely of residential housing, with more public sector housing in the lower sections of the road. There are lots of small shops lining the road as well as schools, churches, hospitals and leisure facilities.  Employment in the area was originally dominated by the large linen mills but these have mostly closed. Today, local employment is in the service sector, health and education with additional employment in other parts of the city. \n\nThe Falls Road district can be roughly divided into three sections.  The Lower Falls which includes Divis Street starts near the city centre and continues to the junction with the [[Grosvenor Road]].  The middle Falls district centres on Beechmount.  The Upper Falls starts about the Donegall Road and continues into [[Andersonstown]].\n\n==Lower Falls==\nThis section of the road stretches from Millfield near the city centre to the Grosvenor Road/[[Springfield Road]] intersection.  The lower part is named Divis Street as formally the Falls Road begins at the junction with Northumberland Street and Albert Street. This area was considered the heart of the Falls Road and was initially composed of rows of small terraced houses which were constructed in the mid to late nineteenth century. The area is detailed in the 1931 Ordnance Survey map of the area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:Falls Road area, Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Falls Road area, Belfast 1981|Children playing near Falls Road, Belfast, 1981]]\nThe housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. Many of the old streets were named after characters and events in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856) which was occurring at that time.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> These include Raglan Street (named after [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], commander of British forces in the [[Crimean War]]), Garnet Street (after [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley]]), Alma Street (after the [[Battle of Alma]]), Balaklava Street (after the [[Battle of Balaklava]]),  Inkerman Street (after the [[Battle of Inkerman]]), Sevastopol Street (after the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol]]), Plevna Street (after the [[Siege of Plevna]]), and Varna Street (after the [[Siege of Varna]]). There were also streets named after Balkan places such as Bosnia Street, Balkan Street, Roumania Street and [[Serbia|Servia]] Street, as well as Milan Street and Omar Street (possibly after common Slavic names). Other streets were named after contemporary political and royal figures such as Peel Street (after [[Robert Peel]]) and Albert Street (named after [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\nThese street names are recalled in the collection of poetry ''The Irish for No'' by [[Ciaran Carson]].  In one of the poems entitled ''The Exiles\u2019 Club'', Carson imagines a group of Belfast exiles:\n:''After years they have reconstructed the whole of the Falls Road, and now''\n:''Are working on the back streets: Lemon, Peel and Omar, Balaclava, Alma.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Ciaran |title=The Irish for No |date=1987 |publisher=Gallery Books |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=1 85235 016 4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/irishforno0000cars }}</ref> \n\nBy the 1960s the buildings in the area had decayed considerably and the [[Belfast Corporation]] introduced a major development plan which involved wholescale demolition of much of the area.  Many of the old street names were retained in the new housing development. In the Divis Street area, the housing was replaced with the Divis Flats complex which consisted of twelve blocks of flats built on top of the historic district formerly known as the [[Pound Loney]].<ref>Megan Deirdre Roy.[http://www.uiowa.edu/~history/Resources/Iowa%20Historical%20Journal%20--%20UG/2007_spring_Megan_Roy.pdf ''Divis Flats: The Social and Political Implications of a Modern Housing Project in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1968\u20131998'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, uiowa.edu; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> The high point of this redevelopment was [[Divis Tower]].  Because of its rapid deterioration, the whole complex, except for Divis Tower, was demolished thirty years later and replaced with blocks of terraced housing.\n\n===Schools===\nAt the foot of Divis Street is located the Millfield campus of [[Belfast Metropolitan College]], the largest further and higher education college in Northern Ireland. Nearby was located the original [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]]. In the [[1960s]], this school transferred to a greenfield site on the [[Glen Road]] in the upper Falls.<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School, Belfast|url=http://www.stmaryscbgs.com//|accessdate= 12 November 2016}}</ref> The original school building is now the home of the [[Edmund Rice Schools Trust]]. Opposite is ''St. Mary's Primary School''.  Nearby is the location of the ''\u00c1rd Scoil'' which was historically the centre for Irish language and culture in the area. Just past it was located the Hastings Street [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] station.\n\nThere are currently two other primary schools in the Lower Falls district.  These are ''St. Peter's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Primary School, Belfast| url=http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| access-date=10 March 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312054730/http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| archive-date=12 March 2017| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> on Ross Road and ''St. Joseph's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Joseph's Primary School, Belfast|url=http://www.stjosephsslatestreet.belfast.ni.sch.uk//|accessdate= 10 March 2017}}</ref> on Slate Street. In addition, there is the Irish language [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]] at the top end of Leeson Street.  Several older schools closed in the late twentieth century due to declining student numbers. These include [[St Finian's Primary School|St Finian's]] and ''St Gall's'' primary schools which were run by the [[De La Salle Brothers|De La Salle Christian Brothers]]. St Comgall's Public Elementary School, in Divis Street, opened in 1932 but closed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Comgall's School |url=https://www.28dayslater.co.uk/threads/st-comgalls-school-divis-belfast.110629/ |website=28 Days Later |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> ''St. Brendan's Primary School'' on nearby Milford Street closed in the 1960s but for two years housed some pupils from [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]] which at that time had exceeded its capacity in its Barrack Street premises. \n\nThe ''Dunlewey Centre''<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunlewey Centre Belfast Belfast|url=http://belfast.cylex-uk.co.uk/company/dunlewey-centre-ltd-15582351.html|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> is located near [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]].

This is reflected in the number of Catholic churches in the area. These include [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St Peter's Cathedral]] in the Lower Falls area just off Albert Street. This was originally a parish church built for the expanding Catholic population in the area in the 1860s. It was designed by Fr Jeremiah Ryan McAulay, who had trained as an architect before he became a priest, and built on a site donated by a local baker, [[Bernard Hughes]]. It became the cathedral church for the [[Diocese of Down and Connor|Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor]] and the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Down and Connor in 1986. It is home to St Peter's Schola Cantorum (Choir).<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Cathedral|url=http://www.stpeterscathedralbelfast.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=visit St Peter's Cathedral|url=https://www.inspirock.com/united-kingdom/belfast/st-peters-cathedral-a5141663621|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref> \n\n[[Clonard monastery]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Clonard Monastery|url=http://www.clonard.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> the home of the [[Redemptorist]] religious order, is located nearby. Father [[Alec Reid]] who played an important role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] was based here. \n\nThere were also several Protestant churches in the area.

These included such establishments as McGeowns, the West End Bar, the Laurel Leaf, the Centre Half and Haughey\u2019s. [[Gerry Conlon]], who grew up in Peel Street, recalled in his autobiography ''Proved Innocent'' how he could see several pubs just a few yards from his front door:\n''I\u2019d watch the men off to the pubs. There were three pubs, Paddy Gilmartin\u2019s which was called the Laurel Leaf, Peter Murray\u2019s [the West End Bar] directly opposite, or further down on the right-hand side was Charlie Gormley\u2019s, across from Finnegan\u2019s the butcher shop.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Conlon |first1=Gerry |title=Proved Innocent |date=1990 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London}}</ref> The Centre Half Bar which was located at the corner of Panton Street and the Falls Road was named by the licensee [[Mickey Hamill]] who played for both Belfast Celtic and Glasgow Celtic as well as Manchester United and Manchester City.

These are representations of local and national political issues and figures. One of the most famous is the large mural of [[Bobby Sands]] on the side wall of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s offices at the corner of Sevastopol Street. Further down the road on the corner of Northumberland Street is a series of murals which has come to be called the ''International or Solidarity Wall''.

The district takes its name from Beechmount House which was located at the top of a nearby hill surrounded by beech trees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beechmount|url=http://beechmount.rushlightmagazine.com|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref> It was the former home of [[Eliza and Isabella Riddel]].

This was introduced in the late 19th century and replaced by [[trolleybuses]] in 1938.  There were three routes along the road: 11 for Falls Road-Whiterock Road, 12 for Falls Road-Andersonstown Road and 13 for Falls Road-Glen Road. These trolleybuses were replaced by diesel buses in the 1960s. With the outbreak of the troubles, the bus service was withdrawn.  The gap in public transport was replaced by black taxis.  Since the troubles ended, the public bus service has been re-introduced and expanded. [[Metro (Belfast)|Metro]], a division of [[Translink]] now operates the bus service.

[[James Connolly]] resided in the Upper Falls for a period in the early 20th century and was involved in organising the workers<ref>Donal Nevin. ''James Connolly. A Full Life''; (Dublin, 2006, Gill & Macmillan); {{ISBN|0717129624}}</ref> but the area was generally seen as a bedrock of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) at the time. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] standing for [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] lost heavily standing in the [[Belfast Falls (UK Parliament constituency)|Falls]] constituency in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 UK General Election]] to the IPP's [[Joseph Devlin|Joe Devlin]]. Connolly's secretary [[Winifred Carney]] also lived on the Falls with her husband, George McBride, a Protestant and [[World War I]] veteran. She is buried in Milltown Cemetery.\n\nThe past century has seen an ongoing contest between various versions of labour/socialist and nationalist/[[Irish republican]] for electoral leadership in the area. In the 1929 election to the new [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the [[Belfast Falls (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast, Falls]] constituency was won by the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist]] [[Richard Byrne (politician)|Richard Byrne]] after a bitter contest with [[William McMullen (politician)|William McMullen]], a supporter of Connolly.<ref name=\"farrell\">[[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]], ''Northern Ireland: The Orange State''</ref>\n\nIn the 1945 election, [[Harry Diamond (politician)|Harry Diamond]] won the seat standing for the [[Socialist Republican Party (Ireland)|Socialist Republican Party]].

His office was in Divis Street and the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] alongside the [[The Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] of Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army]] was displayed in the window. The [[Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954|Flags and Emblems Act]] gave the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] the power to remove any flag or emblem from public or private property which was considered to be likely to cause a breach of the peace. This was generally interpreted as any Irish flag since the [[Union Jack]] was specifically excluded from the Act.\n\n[[Ian Paisley]] insisted the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] remove the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] or he would organise a march and remove it himself.  The police feared a backlash from Loyalists, and removed it, causing unrest and rioting by local residents.<ref>Peter Taylor.

''Burnt Out. How the Troubles began; (Cork, 2019, Mercier); {{ISBN|1781176191}}</ref> These attacks increased during the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots]] when whole streets in the Falls Road area were destroyed by loyalists from the Shankill Road area. [[Timeline of Ulster Volunteer Force actions|Loyalists paramilitaries]] killed many local residents. Temporary barricades were constructed to provide residents with some security. These developed into [[peace lines|peace wall]]s which today separate the Falls Road from the neighbouring Shankill Road.  Although the troubles have now ceased, the peace walls still exists in this so-called [[Interface area]].\n\nFor the following three decades, the British Army maintained a substantial presence on the Falls Road, with a base on top of the Divis Tower. This was removed in August 2005 as part of the [[British government]]'s normalisation programme, following the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s statement that it was ending its armed activities. In the intervening period, the Falls Road area saw some of the worst violence of \"[[the Troubles]]\". The last British soldier to be killed on the road itself was Private Nicholas Peacock, killed by a booby trap bomb left outside the Rock Bar, opposite the top of the Donegall Road.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lost Lives|last=McKittrick, Feeney, Thornton, Kelters|first=David, Brian, Chris, Seamus|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|year=2004|pages=1158, 1248, 1257\u201358}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 IRA hit squads based in the Upper Falls and Beechmount were involved in attacks against loyalist paramilitaries in the nearby Village area. In September 1991, they shot dead 19-year-old UVF member John Hanna at his home on the Donegall Road, and in November the same year, they shot dead William Kingsberry and his stepson, Samuel Mehaffey, members of the UDA and RHC respectively, in their home on Lecale Street.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Literary Sources==\nThere are many literary references to life on the Falls Road.

Its name is synonymous with the [[Irish Republican|republican]] community in the city, whilst the neighbouring [[Shankill Road]] is predominantly [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]], separated from Falls Road by [[peace lines]]. The road is usually referred to as ''the'' Falls Road, rather than as Falls Road. It is known as the ''Faas Raa'' in [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]].<ref>[http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm Language/Cultural Diversity \u2013 Irish Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107052142/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08/irish.htm |date=7 November 2012 }}, dcalni.gov.uk; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Falls rd, Belfast.jpg|thumb|left|The view from the Falls Road to the city centre, 1981]]\nThe Falls Road derives its name from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[t\u00faath]] na bhF\u00e1l'', an Irish [[petty kingdom]] whose name means \"territory of the enclosures\".<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> This territory was roughly the same as that of the [[ecclesiastical parish]] of the Shankill, which spanned a large portion of modern-day Belfast.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/>\n\nThe Falls Road itself was originally a country lane leading from the city centre but the population of the area expanded rapidly in the 19th century with the construction of several large [[linen]] mills. All of these have now closed or have been repurposed. This original area, which was centred on the junction of modern-day Millfield and College Avenue on what is now Divis Street, was known as Falls and lent its name to the road.<ref>[http://joegraham.rushlightmagazine.com/ Belfast History], rushlightmagazine.com; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> which had previously been called ''The Pound''.<ref>{{cite web| title=Old Pound Loney|url=http://oldbelfastdistricts.rushlightmagazine.com/loney.html|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> The housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. The [[Westlink (road)|Westlink]] linking the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] and [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] motorways now cuts through this area. \n\nThe short stretch of road linking Divis Street to the city centre is known as Castle Street after the original [[Belfast Castle]] which was built nearby by the [[Normans]] in the 12th century. Near the bottom of Castle Street is located Chapel Lane on which [[St Mary's Church, Belfast|St. Mary\u2019s Church]] is situated. This is the oldest [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church in Belfast and dates from 1784. \n\nThe Falls Road forms the first three miles of the A501 which starts in Belfast city centre and runs southwest through the city forking just after the Falls Park into the B102 which continues for a short distance to [[Andersonstown]]. The A501 continues as the Glen Road. The area is composed largely of residential housing, with more public sector housing in the lower sections of the road. There are lots of small shops lining the road as well as schools, churches, hospitals and leisure facilities.  Employment in the area was originally dominated by the large linen mills but these have mostly closed. Today, local employment is in the service sector, health and education with additional employment in other parts of the city. \n\nThe Falls Road district can be roughly divided into three sections.  The Lower Falls which includes Divis Street starts near the city centre and continues to the junction with the [[Grosvenor Road]].  The middle Falls district centres on Beechmount.  The Upper Falls starts about the Donegall Road and continues into [[Andersonstown]].\n\n==Lower Falls==\nThis section of the road stretches from Millfield near the city centre to the Grosvenor Road/[[Springfield Road]] intersection.  The lower part is named Divis Street as formally the Falls Road begins at the junction with Northumberland Street and Albert Street. This area was considered the heart of the Falls Road and was initially composed of rows of small terraced houses which were constructed in the mid to late nineteenth century. The area is detailed in the 1931 Ordnance Survey map of the area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:Falls Road area, Belfast 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Falls Road area, Belfast 1981|Children playing near Falls Road, Belfast, 1981]]\nThe housing in the area developed in the 19th century and was organised in narrow streets of small terraced housing. Many of the old streets were named after characters and events in the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856) which was occurring at that time.<ref name=\"PlaceNames NI\"/> These include Raglan Street (named after [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], commander of British forces in the [[Crimean War]]), Garnet Street (after [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley]]), Alma Street (after the [[Battle of Alma]]), Balaklava Street (after the [[Battle of Balaklava]]),  Inkerman Street (after the [[Battle of Inkerman]]), Sevastopol Street (after the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol]]), Plevna Street (after the [[Siege of Plevna]]), and Varna Street (after the [[Siege of Varna]]). There were also streets named after Balkan places such as Bosnia Street, Balkan Street, Roumania Street and [[Serbia|Servia]] Street, as well as Milan Street and Omar Street (possibly after common Slavic names). Other streets were named after contemporary political and royal figures such as Peel Street (after [[Robert Peel]]) and Albert Street (named after [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Old Ordnance Survey Maps:The Falls 1931 |publisher=Alan Godfrey |location=Gateshead |isbn=0 85054 247 2}}</ref>\n\nThese street names are recalled in the collection of poetry ''The Irish for No'' by [[Ciaran Carson]].  In one of the poems entitled ''The Exiles\u2019 Club'', Carson imagines a group of Belfast exiles:\n:''After years they have reconstructed the whole of the Falls Road, and now''\n:''Are working on the back streets: Lemon, Peel and Omar, Balaclava, Alma.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carson |first1=Ciaran |title=The Irish for No |date=1987 |publisher=Gallery Books |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=1 85235 016 4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/irishforno0000cars }}</ref> \n\nBy the 1960s the buildings in the area had decayed considerably and the [[Belfast Corporation]] introduced a major development plan which involved wholescale demolition of much of the area.  Many of the old street names were retained in the new housing development. In the Divis Street area, the housing was replaced with the Divis Flats complex which consisted of twelve blocks of flats built on top of the historic district formerly known as the [[Pound Loney]].<ref>Megan Deirdre Roy.[http://www.uiowa.edu/~history/Resources/Iowa%20Historical%20Journal%20--%20UG/2007_spring_Megan_Roy.pdf ''Divis Flats: The Social and Political Implications of a Modern Housing Project in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 1968\u20131998'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, uiowa.edu; accessed 30 March 2015.</ref> The high point of this redevelopment was [[Divis Tower]].  Because of its rapid deterioration, the whole complex, except for Divis Tower, was demolished thirty years later and replaced with blocks of terraced housing.\n\n===Schools===\nAt the foot of Divis Street is located the Millfield campus of [[Belfast Metropolitan College]], the largest further and higher education college in Northern Ireland. Nearby was located the original [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]]. In the [[1960s]], this school transferred to a greenfield site on the [[Glen Road]] in the upper Falls.<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School, Belfast|url=http://www.stmaryscbgs.com//|accessdate= 12 November 2016}}</ref> The original school building is now the home of the [[Edmund Rice Schools Trust]]. Opposite is ''St. Mary's Primary School''.  Nearby is the location of the ''\u00c1rd Scoil'' which was historically the centre for Irish language and culture in the area. Just past it was located the Hastings Street [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] station.\n\nThere are currently two other primary schools in the Lower Falls district.  These are ''St. Peter's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Primary School, Belfast| url=http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| access-date=10 March 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312054730/http://www.stpeterspsbelfast.co.uk//| archive-date=12 March 2017| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> on Ross Road and ''St. Joseph's''<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Joseph's Primary School, Belfast|url=http://www.stjosephsslatestreet.belfast.ni.sch.uk//|accessdate= 10 March 2017}}</ref> on Slate Street. In addition, there is the Irish language [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]] at the top end of Leeson Street.  Several older schools closed in the late twentieth century due to declining student numbers. These include [[St Finian's Primary School|St Finian's]] and ''St Gall's'' primary schools which were run by the [[De La Salle Brothers|De La Salle Christian Brothers]]. St Comgall's Public Elementary School, in Divis Street, opened in 1932 but closed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Comgall's School |url=https://www.28dayslater.co.uk/threads/st-comgalls-school-divis-belfast.110629/ |website=28 Days Later |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> ''St. Brendan's Primary School'' on nearby Milford Street closed in the 1960s but for two years housed some pupils from [[St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast|St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School]] which at that time had exceeded its capacity in its Barrack Street premises. \n\nThe ''Dunlewey Centre''<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunlewey Centre Belfast Belfast|url=http://belfast.cylex-uk.co.uk/company/dunlewey-centre-ltd-15582351.html|accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> is located near [[St Finian's Primary School|Gaelscoil an Lonn\u00e1in]].

This is reflected in the number of Catholic churches in the area. These include [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St Peter's Cathedral]] in the Lower Falls area just off Albert Street. This was originally a parish church built for the expanding Catholic population in the area in the 1860s. It was designed by Fr Jeremiah Ryan McAulay, who had trained as an architect before he became a priest, and built on a site donated by a local baker, [[Bernard Hughes]]. It became the cathedral church for the [[Diocese of Down and Connor|Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor]] and the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Down and Connor in 1986. It is home to St Peter's Schola Cantorum (Choir).<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Peter's Cathedral|url=http://www.stpeterscathedralbelfast.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=visit St Peter's Cathedral|url=https://www.inspirock.com/united-kingdom/belfast/st-peters-cathedral-a5141663621|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref> \n\n[[Clonard monastery]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Clonard Monastery|url=http://www.clonard.com/|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> the home of the [[Redemptorist]] religious order, is located nearby. Father [[Alec Reid]] who played an important role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] was based here. \n\nThere were also several Protestant churches in the area.

These included such establishments as McGeowns, the West End Bar, the Laurel Leaf, the Centre Half and Haughey\u2019s. [[Gerry Conlon]], who grew up in Peel Street, recalled in his autobiography ''Proved Innocent'' how he could see several pubs just a few yards from his front door:\n''I\u2019d watch the men off to the pubs. There were three pubs, Paddy Gilmartin\u2019s which was called the Laurel Leaf, Peter Murray\u2019s [the West End Bar] directly opposite, or further down on the right-hand side was Charlie Gormley\u2019s, across from Finnegan\u2019s the butcher shop.''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Conlon |first1=Gerry |title=Proved Innocent |date=1990 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London}}</ref> The Centre Half Bar which was located at the corner of Panton Street and the Falls Road was named by the licensee [[Mickey Hamill]] who played for both Belfast Celtic and Glasgow Celtic as well as Manchester United and Manchester City.

One of the most famous is the large mural of [[Bobby Sands]] on the side wall of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s offices at the corner of Sevastopol Street. Further down the road on the corner of Northumberland Street is a series of murals which has come to be called the ''International or Solidarity Wall''.

This was introduced in the late 19th century and replaced by [[trolleybuses]] in 1938.  There were three routes along the road: 11 for Falls Road-Whiterock Road, 12 for Falls Road-Andersonstown Road and 13 for Falls Road-Glen Road. These trolleybuses were replaced by diesel buses in the 1960s. With the outbreak of the troubles, the bus service was withdrawn.  The gap in public transport was replaced by black taxis.  Since the troubles ended, the public bus service has been re-introduced and expanded. [[Metro (Belfast)|Metro]], a division of [[Translink]] now operates the bus service.

[[James Connolly]] resided in the Upper Falls for a period in the early 20th century and was involved in organising the workers<ref>Donal Nevin. ''James Connolly. A Full Life''; (Dublin, 2006, Gill & Macmillan); {{ISBN|0717129624}}</ref> but the area was generally seen as a bedrock of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) at the time. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] standing for [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] lost heavily standing in the [[Belfast Falls (UK Parliament constituency)|Falls]] constituency in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 UK General Election]] to the IPP's [[Joseph Devlin|Joe Devlin]]. Connolly's secretary [[Winifred Carney]] also lived on the Falls with her husband, George McBride, a Protestant and [[World War I]] veteran. She is buried in Milltown Cemetery.\n\nThe past century has seen an ongoing contest between various versions of labour/socialist and nationalist/[[Irish republican]] for electoral leadership in the area. In the 1929 election to the new [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the [[Belfast Falls (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast, Falls]] constituency was won by the [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist]] [[Richard Byrne (politician)|Richard Byrne]] after a bitter contest with [[William McMullen (politician)|William McMullen]], a supporter of Connolly.<ref name=\"farrell\">[[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]], ''Northern Ireland: The Orange State''</ref>\n\nIn the 1945 election, [[Harry Diamond (politician)|Harry Diamond]] won the seat standing for the [[Socialist Republican Party (Ireland)|Socialist Republican Party]].

His office was in Divis Street and the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] alongside the [[The Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] of Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army]] was displayed in the window. The [[Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954|Flags and Emblems Act]] gave the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] the power to remove any flag or emblem from public or private property which was considered to be likely to cause a breach of the peace. This was generally interpreted as any Irish flag since the [[Union Jack]] was specifically excluded from the Act.\n\n[[Ian Paisley]] insisted the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] remove the [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] or he would organise a march and remove it himself.  The police feared a backlash from Loyalists, and removed it, causing unrest and rioting by local residents.<ref>Peter Taylor.

How the Troubles began; (Cork, 2019, Mercier); {{ISBN|1781176191}}</ref> These attacks increased during the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots]] when whole streets in the Falls Road area were destroyed by loyalists from the Shankill Road area. [[Timeline of Ulster Volunteer Force actions|Loyalists paramilitaries]] killed many local residents. Temporary barricades were constructed to provide residents with some security. These developed into [[peace lines|peace wall]]s which today separate the Falls Road from the neighbouring Shankill Road.  Although the troubles have now ceased, the peace walls still exists in this so-called [[Interface area]].\n\nFor the following three decades, the British Army maintained a substantial presence on the Falls Road, with a base on top of the Divis Tower. This was removed in August 2005 as part of the [[British government]]'s normalisation programme, following the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]'s statement that it was ending its armed activities. In the intervening period, the Falls Road area saw some of the worst violence of \"[[the Troubles]]\". The last British soldier to be killed on the road itself was Private Nicholas Peacock, killed by a booby trap bomb left outside the Rock Bar, opposite the top of the Donegall Road.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lost Lives|last=McKittrick, Feeney, Thornton, Kelters|first=David, Brian, Chris, Seamus|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|year=2004|pages=1158, 1248, 1257\u201358}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 IRA hit squads based in the Upper Falls and Beechmount were involved in attacks against loyalist paramilitaries in the nearby Village area.
