It received its first arrivals on 2 December 1941. In early 1942, the camp experienced an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] which was exacerbated by the arrival of Jewish deportees from Slovenia. The NDH's ruling [[Usta\u0161e]] movement subsequently assumed direct control of the camp and many detainees were consequently subjected to torture, rape and degradation. In mid-May, Croatia's [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] ordered that the camp be shut down. Between 15 June and 7 July 1942, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]], where they perished. As many as 3,800 women and children were interred at the camp over the course of its existence, and at least 569 women and children died, although this figure may have been as high as 800.\n\nIn 1945, Yugoslavia's new [[communist]] authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. In September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled a monument to the victims of the camp. Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]]. A commemorative ceremony is held every year at the site, as well as at a nearby cemetery where the bodies of detainees were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of [[the Holocaust]] were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|inmate number]]. In 2013, a sculpture titled Peace in Heaven, by Croatian-born Israeli sculptor [[Dina Merhav]], was unveiled in \u0110akovo to commemorate those who were interred at the camp.\n\n==Background==\n===Interwar Yugoslavia===\nEthnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] increased following the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period]], many Croats came to resent Serb political hegemony in the newly established state, which resulted in the passing of legislation that favoured Serb political, religious and business interests.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=158}} Tensions flared in 1928, following the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies by the Montenegrin Serb politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]]. Two died on the spot and two others were wounded but survived. A fifth, the opposition leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], died nearly two months later of complications attributed to the shooting. In January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] instituted a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] and renamed the country [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Shortly thereafter, the Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] formed the [[Usta\u0161e]], a [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movement which sought to achieve Croatian independence through violent means. The Usta\u0161e were outlawed in Yugoslavia, but received covert assistance from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had territorial pretensions in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The Usta\u0161e carried out a number of actions aimed at undermining Yugoslavia, most notably the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932 and the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] in 1934. Following Alexander's assassination, the Usta\u0161e movement's senior-most leaders, including Paveli\u0107, were tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]] in both France and Yugoslavia and sentenced to death, but were granted protection by Mussolini and thus evaded capture.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=25\u201334}}\n\nFollowing the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Royal Yugoslav Government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Royal Yugoslav Government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They placed his teenage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne and brought to power a \"government of national unity\" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=10\u201313}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered Yugoslavia's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}\n\n===Creation of the NDH===\n[[File:Ndh 1941.png|thumb|right|230px|A map depicting the occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131943]]\nYugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. Hitler wished to irrevocably dismantle Yugoslavia, which he dubbed a \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] construct\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Hitler was known to be a virulent [[anti-Serb sentiment|Serbophobe]].{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=238}}{{sfn|Lampe|2014|loc=p. 325, note 20}} He and other senior German leaders considered the Serbs to be [[Untermensch|subhuman]] ({{lang-de|Untermensch}}).{{sfn|Umbreit|2000|p=97}} Thus, in Hitler's conception of the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order of Europe]], they were to be collectively punished.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Serbia was reduced to its pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders, becoming the only country in the Western Balkans to be directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=49}} Serb-inhabited territories west of the [[Drina]] River were incorporated into the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}; NDH), which included most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The establishment of the NDH had been announced over the radio by [[Slavko Kvaternik]], a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad, on 10 April.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=155}}\n\nPaveli\u0107 entered the NDH on 13 April and reached [[Zagreb]] two days later. The same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Paveli\u0107 assumed control and bestowed himself the title ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\").{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} At the time of its establishment, the NDH had a population of 6.5 million inhabitants, about half of whom were Croats. It was also inhabited by nearly two million Serbs, who constituted about one-third of its total population.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=19\u201320}} Lands inhabited by Serbs accounted for 60\u201370 percent of the NDH's total landmass. Nevertheless, Serbs \u2013 along with others whom the Usta\u0161e deemed \"undesirable\", such as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] \u2013 were denied citizenship on the basis that they were not [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s. Within hours of the NDH's creation, businesses brandished signs reading: \"No Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and dogs\". Additionally, immediate measures were taken to expunge the presence of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] from the public sphere.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=31\u201332}} On 17 April, the Usta\u0161e instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages in the NDH. Thirty concentration camps in total were established across the puppet state.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=136\u2013138}}\n\n==Operation==\n===Establishment and first arrivals===\n[[\u0110akovo]], located about {{convert|197|km}} southeast of Zagreb, is notable as the seat of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek|Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek]], and prior to and during World War II, was the home to one of Croatia's largest concentrations of ethnic [[Germans]].{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} In November 1941, two senior local Jewish community leaders, Dragutin Rosenberg and Aleksandar Klein, persuaded the head of the Jewish Bureau of the Usta\u0161e Surveillance Service ({{lang-hr|Usta\u0161ka nadzorna slu\u017eba}}; UNS), Vilko K\u00fchnel, to authorize the establishment of a refugee camp in \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Bauer|1981|p=281}} In late November, the [[Osijek]] police ordered the town's Jewish community to make room within five days for 2,000 Jewish women and children. Whereas women and children would be deported to \u0110akovo, Jewish males were to be deported to the largest of the NDH's concentration camps, [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]]. Local Jewish youths quickly converted a {{convert|40|m|adj=on}}-long, three-storey abandoned [[flour mill]] that had once been used by the archdiocese into a refugee camp to house the women and children. Several surrounding buildings were subsequently added to the refugee camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nOn 2 December, 1,800 Jewish women and children and fifty Bosnian Serb women arrived at the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Most were from [[Sarajevo]], but also from Zagreb, [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]], [[Pakrac]], [[Slavonski Brod|Slavonski]] and [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]], [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]], [[Zenica]] and [[Travnik]].{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} On 8 December, the Jewish community in Sarajevo requested that the Jewish communities in Sarajevo, Zagreb and Osijek be permitted to provide donations to support the civilian populations of the Jasenovac, Loborgrad and \u0110akovo camps. Ten days later, the UNS's Jewish Bureau permitted the funds that had been raised by the Jewish communities to be allocated to the detainees at these camps.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|p=160}} During their confinement, the detainees were made to do manual labour. Ceramics and leather workshops were established within the camp, where most of the adult female detainees worked. As many as 400 women were made to do agricultural work on farms and in fields near the camp. A kindergarten was organized for the children.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nThe campgrounds provided inadequate shelter from the elements.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The detainees were subjected to appalling sanitary conditions.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} During the first several months of its existence, the camp was guarded by two or three police officers under the command of Dragutin Mayer.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The policemen allowed detainees to leave the camp to purchase necessary goods in the town, to visit the hospital in Osijek and to call relatives and friends.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Although the detainees were permitted to purchase medicine and the pesticide [[Zyklon B]] for disinfection, they were [[Price gouging|price gouged]] by the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n===Typhoid epidemic===\nIn early 1942, the camp experienced a [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] outbreak. Prominent locals, most notably the Archbishop of \u0110akovo, [[Anton Ak\u0161amovi\u0107]], feared that the outbreak could spread outside the camp. On 30 January 1942, the authorities dispatched a medical commission to \u0110akovo, which took note of the inhumane living conditions to which the detainees were subjected, and recommended an increase in the amount and quality of medical supplies allocated to the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} No action was taken to remedy the situation.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} A small number of prisoners were consequently taken to hospitals. Around the same time, local officials demanded that the camp be relocated further from the town to stem the epidemic, but because the arrest and deportation of Slovenian Jews had recently commenced, the UNS sought to enlarge the camp. These deportations led to an increase in the number and size of transports to the camp by February.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} A transport of 1,161 women, originating from [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka concentration camp|Stara Gradi\u0161ka]], arrived at \u0110akovo on 24 February 1942. By this time, the camp housed about 3,000 deportees, around one-quarter of them children under the age of 14.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Of the 1,073 women and children who arrived at \u0110akovo between 26 February and 6 March 1942, 274 \u2013 or just over one-quarter \u2013 were from Zagreb.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}}\n\nThe large increase in the number of detainees swiftly worsened the typhoid epidemic.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} According to the cultural anthropologist [[Peter W. Van Arsdale]], the transfer of women and children from Stara Gradi\u0161ka to \u0110akovo was made intentionally to further the spread of typhoid fever among the \u0110akovo detainees.{{sfn|van Arsdale|2006|p=72}} By March 1942, 631 detainees were hospitalized, an additional 219 were infected, and 131 had died. In response to the epidemic, the authorities and the local Jewish community agreed to place some of the Jewish children from the camp in the care of local Jewish foster families.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} All Jewish children under the age of ten were to be removed from the camp as part of this arrangement.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Jewish community officials administered the camp until 29 March 1942. In mid-April 1942, the Usta\u0161e assumed direct control of the camp with a detachment from Jasenovac led by Jozo Matijevi\u0107. Some of these new guards set up living quarters in adjacent villages and others lived on the camp premises. The new camp guards ensured that none of the detainees could leave the campgrounds, as had previously been the case, and the detainees were thus no longer able to make contact with the outside world. All subsequent aid deliveries were seized by the Usta\u0161e and detainees were often robbed.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Hunger became rampant; daily rations were reduced to two or three potatoes per person.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} Many detainees were subjected to rape and torture.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} Although no systematic killings took place, detainees were routinely abused and humiliated, and multiple individual killings occurred as well.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} On one occasion, the Usta\u0161e amused themselves by tossing loaves of bread to the starving children. When the children set upon the bread, the Usta\u0161e released their hungry dogs upon them. According to one eyewitness, after a dog tore a piece of flesh from one of the children, one of the Usta\u0161e dragged both the child and the dog into a storehouse and locked the door. As the child screamed, the Usta\u0161e danced to the [[accordion]].{{sfn|Jancar-Webster|1990|p=132}}\n\n===Closure===\n[[File:Voz Jasenovac.JPG|thumb|right|260px|One of the trains that transported prisoners to [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] {{small|(on display in 2010)|small}}]]\nBy May, as many as 800 detainees had succumbed to typhoid fever,{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} which killed between five and six detainees daily.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} An additional 700 detainees contracted other diseases.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|loc=p. 160, note 190}} By this point, the camp had become a burden to the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} On 18 May 1942, the Croatian [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] asked the [[RAVSIGUR|Directorate for Public Order and Security]] ({{lang-hr|Ravnateljstvo za javni red i sigurnost}}; RAVSIGUR) to dissolve the camp within one month.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} This message was personally relayed to RAVSIGUR by the Minister of Health, Ivo Petri\u0107, who proposed the \"relocation\" or \"closing down\" of the camp together with the provision of \"improved and increased food for the prisoners\". Despite Petri\u0107's suggestions, RAVSIGUR decided it would be most expedient to kill all the detainees.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Zagreb's Jewish community subsequently offered to help restock the camp, but the authorities declined their offer because they had already decided to liquidate it.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}}\n\nBetween 15 June and 7 July, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported from \u0110akovo to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} The operation was overseen by [[Lieutenant]] ({{lang-hr|Poru\u010dnik}}) Joso Matkovi\u0107.{{sfn|Basta|1986|p=176}} For days, they were left in locked railways carriages on the train tracks outside the camp, and many consequently died of heat, thirst and hunger. Those that survived this ordeal were taken off the railway carriages, ferried across the [[Sava]] River and killed.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} Their bodies were then pushed into the Sava by [[Romani people|Romani]] slave labourers, who were later killed themselves.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Unaware of their fate, between 7 July and 14 July, the Jewish community in Zagreb sent about 120 food parcels to Jasenovac for the former \u0110akovo detainees. By September 1942, members of Zagreb's Jewish community began to suspect that the detainees had been killed, although when asked, Usta\u0161e officials would only reply that the detainees had been transported to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=361}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Peace in Heaven 2013 \u0110akovo Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Peace in Heaven monument, by [[Dina Merhav]], commemorates those who were interred at \u0110akovo]]\nDuring the course of its existence, the \u0110akovo camp housed as many as 3,800 civilians.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} In August 1942, around 1,200 Jews were deported from Osijek, leaving all but 40 to 50 of the Jewish foster children that had been taken from the \u0110akovo camp left in the town. Many of these children subsequently escaped to [[Split, Croatia|Split]], in the Italian occupation zone.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=123}} Around 25,000 Jews were killed in the NDH during [[the Holocaust]], according to [[Yad Vashem]].{{sfn|Yad Vashem 2020}} In 1945, the Yugoslav authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. The following year, former Jasenovac concentration camp administrator [[Miroslav Filipovi\u0107]] testified about the killing of the \u0110akovo detainees at Jasenovac in July 1942.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nIn September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled five monuments to the victims of the Holocaust in Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Novi Sad and \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Byford|2013|p=523}} Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]].{{sfn|Suboti\u0107|2019|p=122}} A commemorative ceremony is held at the site every year on the first Sunday in June. The commemoration also encompasses the nearby cemetery in which the camp detainees who died were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of the Holocaust were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|inmate number]].{{sfn|Friedman|2013|p=94}} There are 569 camp victims buried in the cemetery.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} On this basis, the historians Jens Hoppe and Alexander Korb have concluded that the camp's mortality rate amounted to nearly 19 percent.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} In June 2013, a sculpture titled Peace in Heaven, by Croatian-born Israeli

It received its first arrivals on 2 December 1941. In early 1942, the camp experienced an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] which was exacerbated by the arrival of Jewish deportees from Slovenia. The NDH's ruling [[Usta\u0161e]] movement subsequently assumed direct control of the camp and many detainees were consequently subjected to torture, rape and degradation. In mid-May, Croatia's [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] ordered that the camp be shut down. Between 15 June and 7 July 1942, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]], where they perished. As many as 3,800 women and children were interred at the camp over the course of its existence, and at least 569 women and children died, although this figure may have been as high as 800. \n\nIn 1945, Yugoslavia's new [[communist]] authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. In September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled a monument to the victims of the camp. Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]]. A commemorative ceremony is held every year at the site, as well as at a nearby cemetery where the bodies of detainees were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of [[the Holocaust]] were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|inmate number]]. In 2013, a sculpture titled Peace in Heaven, by Croatian-born Israeli sculptor [[Dina Merhav]], was unveiled in \u0110akovo to commemorate those who were interred at the camp.\n\n==Background==\n===Interwar Yugoslavia===\nEthnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] increased following the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period]], many Croats came to resent Serb political hegemony in the newly established state, which resulted in the passing of legislation that favoured Serb political, religious and business interests.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=158}} Tensions flared in 1928, following the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies by the Montenegrin Serb politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]]. Two died on the spot and two others were wounded but survived. A fifth, the opposition leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], died nearly two months later of complications attributed to the shooting. In January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] instituted a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] and renamed the country [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Shortly thereafter, the Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] formed the [[Usta\u0161e]], a [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movement which sought to achieve Croatian independence through violent means. The Usta\u0161e were outlawed in Yugoslavia, but received covert assistance from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had territorial pretensions in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The Usta\u0161e carried out a number of actions aimed at undermining Yugoslavia, most notably the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932 and the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] in 1934. Following Alexander's assassination, the Usta\u0161e movement's senior-most leaders, including Paveli\u0107, were tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]] in both France and Yugoslavia and sentenced to death, but were granted protection by Mussolini and thus evaded capture.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=25\u201334}}\n\nFollowing the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Royal Yugoslav Government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Royal Yugoslav Government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They placed his teenage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne and brought to power a \"government of national unity\" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=10\u201313}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered Yugoslavia's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}\n\n===Creation of the NDH===\n[[File:Ndh 1941.png|thumb|right|230px|A map depicting the occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131943]]\nYugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. Hitler wished to irrevocably dismantle Yugoslavia, which he dubbed a \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] construct\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Hitler was known to be a virulent [[anti-Serb sentiment|Serbophobe]].{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=238}}{{sfn|Lampe|2014|loc=p. 325, note 20}} He and other senior German leaders considered the Serbs to be [[Untermensch|subhuman]] ({{lang-de|Untermensch}}).{{sfn|Umbreit|2000|p=97}} Thus, in Hitler's conception of the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order of Europe]], they were to be collectively punished.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Serbia was reduced to its pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders, becoming the only country in the Western Balkans to be directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=49}} Serb-inhabited territories west of the [[Drina]] River were incorporated into the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}; NDH), which included most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The establishment of the NDH had been announced over the radio by [[Slavko Kvaternik]], a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad, on 10 April.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=155}}\n\nPaveli\u0107 entered the NDH on 13 April and reached [[Zagreb]] two days later. The same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Paveli\u0107 assumed control and bestowed himself the title ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\").{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} At the time of its establishment, the NDH had a population of 6.5 million inhabitants, about half of whom were Croats. It was also inhabited by nearly two million Serbs, who constituted about one-third of its total population.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=19\u201320}} Lands inhabited by Serbs accounted for 60\u201370 percent of the NDH's total landmass. Nevertheless, Serbs \u2013 along with others whom the Usta\u0161e deemed \"undesirable\", such as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] \u2013 were denied citizenship on the basis that they were not [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s. Within hours of the NDH's creation, businesses brandished signs reading: \"No Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and dogs\". Additionally, immediate measures were taken to expunge the presence of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] from the public sphere.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=31\u201332}} On 17 April, the Usta\u0161e instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages in the NDH. Thirty concentration camps in total were established across the puppet state.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=136\u2013138}}\n\n==Operation==\n===Establishment and first arrivals===\n[[\u0110akovo]], located about {{convert|197|km}} southeast of Zagreb, is notable as the seat of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek|Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek]], and prior to and during World War II, was the home to one of Croatia's largest concentrations of ethnic [[Germans]].{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} In November 1941, two senior local Jewish community leaders, Dragutin Rosenberg and Aleksandar Klein, persuaded the head of the Jewish Bureau of the Usta\u0161e Surveillance Service ({{lang-hr|Usta\u0161ka nadzorna slu\u017eba}}; UNS), Vilko K\u00fchnel, to authorize the establishment of a refugee camp in \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Bauer|1981|p=281}} In late November, the [[Osijek]] police ordered the town's Jewish community to make room within five days for 2,000 Jewish women and children. Whereas women and children would be deported to \u0110akovo, Jewish males were to be deported to the largest of the NDH's concentration camps, [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]]. Local Jewish youths quickly converted a {{convert|40|m|adj=on}}-long, three-storey abandoned [[flour mill]] that had once been used by the archdiocese into a refugee camp to house the women and children. Several surrounding buildings were subsequently added to the refugee camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nOn 2 December, 1,800 Jewish women and children and fifty Bosnian Serb women arrived at the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Most were from [[Sarajevo]], but also from Zagreb, [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]], [[Pakrac]], [[Slavonski Brod|Slavonski]] and [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]], [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]], [[Zenica]] and [[Travnik]].{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} On 8 December, the Jewish community in Sarajevo requested that the Jewish communities in Sarajevo, Zagreb and Osijek be permitted to provide donations to support the civilian populations of the Jasenovac, Loborgrad and \u0110akovo camps. Ten days later, the UNS's Jewish Bureau permitted the funds that had been raised by the Jewish communities to be allocated to the detainees at these camps.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|p=160}} During their confinement, the detainees were made to do manual labour. Ceramics and leather workshops were established within the camp, where most of the adult female detainees worked. As many as 400 women were made to do agricultural work on farms and in fields near the camp. A kindergarten was organized for the children.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}  \n\nThe campgrounds provided inadequate shelter from the elements.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The detainees were subjected to appalling sanitary conditions.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} During the first several months of its existence, the camp was guarded by two or three police officers under the command of Dragutin Mayer.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The policemen allowed detainees to leave the camp to purchase necessary goods in the town, to visit the hospital in Osijek and to call relatives and friends.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Although the detainees were permitted to purchase medicine and the pesticide [[Zyklon B]] for disinfection, they were [[Price gouging|price gouged]] by the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n===Typhoid epidemic===\nIn early 1942, the camp experienced a [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] outbreak. Prominent locals, most notably the Archbishop of \u0110akovo, [[Anton Ak\u0161amovi\u0107]], feared that the outbreak could spread outside the camp. On 30 January 1942, the authorities dispatched a medical commission to \u0110akovo, which took note of the inhumane living conditions to which the detainees were subjected, and recommended an increase in the amount and quality of medical supplies allocated to the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} No action was taken to remedy the situation.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} A small number of prisoners were consequently taken to hospitals. Around the same time, local officials demanded that the camp be relocated further from the town to stem the epidemic, but because the arrest and deportation of Slovenian Jews had recently commenced, the UNS sought to enlarge the camp. These deportations led to an increase in the number and size of transports to the camp by February.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} A transport of 1,161 women, originating from [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka concentration camp|Stara Gradi\u0161ka]], arrived at \u0110akovo on 24 February 1942. By this time, the camp housed about 3,000 deportees, around one-quarter of them children under the age of 14.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Of the 1,073 women and children who arrived at \u0110akovo between 26 February and 6 March 1942, 274 \u2013 or just over one-quarter \u2013 were from Zagreb.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}}\n\nThe large increase in the number of detainees swiftly worsened the typhoid epidemic.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} According to the cultural anthropologist [[Peter W. Van Arsdale]], the transfer of women and children from Stara Gradi\u0161ka to \u0110akovo was made intentionally to further the spread of typhoid fever among the \u0110akovo detainees.{{sfn|van Arsdale|2006|p=72}} By March 1942, 631 detainees were hospitalized, an additional 219 were infected, and 131 had died. In response to the epidemic, the authorities and the local Jewish community agreed to place some of the Jewish children from the camp in the care of local Jewish foster families.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} All Jewish children under the age of ten were to be removed from the camp as part of this arrangement.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Jewish community officials administered the camp until 29 March 1942. In mid-April 1942, the Usta\u0161e assumed direct control of the camp with a detachment from Jasenovac led by Jozo Matijevi\u0107. Some of these new guards set up living quarters in adjacent villages and others lived on the camp premises. The new camp guards ensured that none of the detainees could leave the campgrounds, as had previously been the case, and the detainees were thus no longer able to make contact with the outside world. All subsequent aid deliveries were seized by the Usta\u0161e and detainees were often robbed.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Hunger became rampant; daily rations were reduced to two or three potatoes per person.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} Many detainees were subjected to rape and torture.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} Although no systematic killings took place, detainees were routinely abused and humiliated, and multiple individual killings occurred as well.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} On one occasion, the Usta\u0161e amused themselves by tossing loaves of bread to the starving children. When the children set upon the bread, the Usta\u0161e released their hungry dogs upon them. According to one eyewitness, after a dog tore a piece of flesh from one of the children, one of the Usta\u0161e dragged both the child and the dog into a storehouse and locked the door. As the child screamed, the Usta\u0161e danced to the [[accordion]].{{sfn|Jancar-Webster|1990|p=132}}\n\n===Closure===\n[[File:Voz Jasenovac.JPG|thumb|right|260px|One of the trains that transported prisoners to [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] {{small|(on display in 2010)|small}}]]\nBy May, as many as 800 detainees had succumbed to typhoid fever,{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} which killed between five and six detainees daily.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} An additional 700 detainees contracted other diseases.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|loc=p. 160, note 190}} By this point, the camp had become a burden to the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} On 18 May 1942, the Croatian [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] asked the [[RAVSIGUR|Directorate for Public Order and Security]] ({{lang-hr|Ravnateljstvo za javni red i sigurnost}}; RAVSIGUR) to dissolve the camp within one month.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} This message was personally relayed to RAVSIGUR by the Minister of Health, Ivo Petri\u0107, who proposed the \"relocation\" or \"closing down\" of the camp together with the provision of \"improved and increased food for the prisoners\". Despite Petri\u0107's suggestions, RAVSIGUR decided it would be most expedient to kill all the detainees.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Zagreb's Jewish community subsequently offered to help restock the camp, but the authorities declined their offer because they had already decided to liquidate it.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}}\n\nBetween 15 June and 7 July, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported from \u0110akovo to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} The operation was overseen by [[Lieutenant]] ({{lang-hr|Poru\u010dnik}}) Joso Matkovi\u0107.{{sfn|Basta|1986|p=176}} For days, they were left in locked railways carriages on the train tracks outside the camp, and many consequently died of heat, thirst and hunger. Those that survived this ordeal were taken off the railway carriages, ferried across the [[Sava]] River and killed.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} Their bodies were then pushed into the Sava by [[Romani people|Romani]] slave labourers, who were later killed themselves.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Unaware of their fate, between 7 July and 14 July, the Jewish community in Zagreb sent about 120 food parcels to Jasenovac for the former \u0110akovo detainees. By September 1942, members of Zagreb's Jewish community began to suspect that the detainees had been killed, although when asked, Usta\u0161e officials would only reply that the detainees had been transported to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=361}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Peace in Heaven 2013 \u0110akovo Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Peace in Heaven monument, by [[Dina Merhav]], commemorates those who were interred at \u0110akovo]]\nDuring the course of its existence, the \u0110akovo camp housed as many as 3,800 civilians.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} In August 1942, around 1,200 Jews were deported from Osijek, leaving all but 40 to 50 of the Jewish foster children that had been taken from the \u0110akovo camp left in the town.

The following year, former Jasenovac concentration camp administrator [[Miroslav Filipovi\u0107]] testified about the killing of the \u0110akovo detainees at Jasenovac in July 1942.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nIn September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled five monuments to the victims of the Holocaust in Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Novi Sad and \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Byford|2013|p=523}} Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]].{{sfn|Suboti\u0107|2019|p=122}} A commemorative ceremony is held at the site every year on the first Sunday in June. The commemoration also encompasses the nearby cemetery in which the camp detainees who died were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of the Holocaust were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in

In Jackson's adaptation \u00c9omer is also responsible for the death of the leader of the M\u00fbmak-riding [[Haradrim]], while in the book it is Th\u00e9oden who slays the Haradrim chieftain, who is on horseback.

Growing up, he practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]].

Growing up, he practiced his baseball skills with Harry Stokes, a boy in his neighborhood seven years his senior who would play catch with him. Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n11 out of 16 [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams showed interest in Richardson, as well as the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Georgia Tech University]], which offered baseball scholarships. [[Mayo Smith]], manager of the [[Norfolk Tars]], a team in the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]] and an affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris.

He was noted for his designs of [[Art Nouveau glass art]] and [[Art Nouveau furniture]], and was a founder of the [[\u00c9cole de Nancy]] or Nancy School, a movement of design in the city of [[Nancy, France]].\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early Life and Education ===\nGall\u00e9 born on March 4, 1846 in the city of [[Nancy, France]].  His father, Charles Gall\u00e9, was a merchant of glassware and ceramics who had settled in Nancy in 1844, and his father-in-law owned a factory in Nancy which manufactured mirrors.  His father took over the direction of his mother's family business, and began to manufacture glassware with a floral design. He also took over a struggling [[faience]] factory and began make new products.  {{sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1980)|page=52}}\n\nThe young Gall\u00e9 studied philosophy and natural science at the Lyc\u00e9e Imperial in Nancy.  At the age of sixteen he went to work for the family business as an assistant to his father, making floral designs and emblems for both faience and glass. In his spare time he became an accomplished botanist, studying with D.A. Godron, the director of the Botanical Gardens of Nancy and author of the leading textbooks on French flora. He collected plants from the region and from as far away as Italy and Switzerland. He also took courses in painting and drawing, and made numerous drawings of plants, flowers, animals and insects, which became subjects of decoration.  {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=15}} \n \nAt the age of sixteen he finished the Lyc\u00e9e in Nancy and went to [[Weimar]] in Germany from 1862-1866 to continue his studies in philosophy, botany, sculpture and drawing. In 1866, to prepare himself to inherit the family business, he went to work as an apprentice at the glass factory of Burgun and Schwerer in [[Meisenthal]], and made a serious study of the chemistry of glass production.  Some of his early glass and faience works for the family factory at Saint-Cl\u00e9mont were displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|1867 Paris Universal Exposition]]. In early 1870 he designed a complete set of dishware with a rustic animal designs for the family enterprise. During this time he became acquainted with the painter, sculptor and engraver [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]], an artist of the romantic \"troubadour\" style, who became his future collaborator in the Nancy School. {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=16}}\n\nHe enlisted for military service in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, then was demobilised after the disastrous French defeat in 1871 and the French loss to Germany of much of the province of [[Lorraine]], including [[Meisenthal]] where he done his apprenticeship.  Thereafter the [[Cross of Lorraine]], the patriotic symbol of the region, became part of his signature on many of his works of art.\n\nAfter his demobilization Gall\u00e9 went to London, where he represented his father at an exhibition of the arts of France, then to Paris, where he remained for several months, visiting the Louvre and [[Cluny Museum]], studying examples of ancient Egyptian art, Roman glassware and ceramics, and especially early Islamic enamelled glass, a technique which influenced his own later work.  After further travel to Switzerland and Italy, he returned to Nancy and established his own workshop at the glass factory. His father Charles continued as head of the company, but \u00c9mile gradually took charge of the design and production, \nIn 1873 he took up residence in La Garenne (\"the rabbit warren\"), the three-story neoclassical house built by his father and surrounded by gardens. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Gall\u00e9Maison.jpg|''la Garenne'', Gall\u00e9's house in Nancy\n</gallery>\n\n===Head of the company and international success===\nIn 1874 the elder Gall\u00e9 turned the family business, the Maison Gall\u00e9-Reinemer. over to \u00c9mile.  The following year \u00c9mile married Henriette Grimm, and after years of traveling, settled permanently in Nancy. He regrouped and reorganized the divisions of faience and glass manufacture, and in 1883 built new and larger workshops for glass and faience manufacture also for making furniture. By 1889 he had over three hundred employees. His own office and studio was in the center of the complex. He trained the designers himself, and sent them water colors of floral designs he made in the gardens of his residence,  Gall\u00e9 ordered his designers to use only real flowers and plants as their models, though they could take some liberties in the final design. He wrote in 1889, \"it is necessary to have a pronounced bias in favour of models taken from flora and fauna, while giving them free expression.\" {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}}\n\nGall\u00e9 continued to expand his activities,  In 1885 He opened his first shop in Paris at 12 rue Richter, followed by other shops in Frankfurt-am-Maine and London. He also took part on a grand scale in international expositions; beginning with the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Universal Exposition]], where his pavilion was thirty meters long; the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago; and especially the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition]], which was the summit of his fame, His work at the Exposition was rewarded with two Grand Prizes, a Gold Medal, and the title of a commander in the [[Legion of Honor]].{{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Atelier di disegno di \u00e9mile gall\u00e9 a nancy, modlelo di quattro facce per due vasi, 1885 ca.JPG|Designs of two vases by Gall\u00e9 (1885)\nFile:Atelier di disegno di \u00e9mile gall\u00e9 a nancy, vaso con trota e mosca, 1885-1900 ca.JPG|Design for a vase with a trout catching a fly (1895-1900)\nFile:Vase MET SF2008 113 mark.jpg|Mark of Gall\u00e9 with the Cross of Lorraine emblem\n</gallery>\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1901, Gall\u00e9 became the founder and first President of the [[\u00c9cole de Nancy]], the organization of Nancy artists of the new style. created to encourage the arts in Nancy, the glassmaker [[Daum (studio)|Antonin Daum]], furniture maker [[Louis Majorelle]] and [[Eugene Vallin]] as Vice Presidents. He had many distinguished patrons, including the [[Edmond James de Rothschild]], and his works were purchased by museums.  In the highest form of tribute, his works were imitated by other glass and ceramics firms. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}}\n\nMuch of his later work used symbolism, and expressed conflict. On one vase, called ''Fiori Oscuri''\nhe engraved the words of [[Robert de Montesquiou]]: \"I love the hour when everything changes its form, when light and dark struggle together.\" {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=136}}\n\nHe became involved in social causes. He was a founder, along with Victor Prouv\u00e9, of the Universit\u00e9 populaire de Nancy, offering university-level classes to workers.  He was treasurer of the Nancy branch of the Human Rights League of France and in 1898, at great risk for his business, one of the first to become actively involved in the defense of [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. He also publicly defended the Romanian Jews and spoke up in defense of the Irish Catholics in Britain, and supported William O\u2019Brien, one of the leaders of the Irish revolt.<ref name=\"Maitre\">''Emile Gall\u00e9 : ma\u00eetre de l'art nouveau'', Fran\u00e7ois Le Tacon; prologue by Henri Claude. 2004 - {{ISBN|2-7165-0620-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1904, his health worsened.  He was diagnosed with [[Leukemia]], and died on September 23, 1904.  His son-in-law, Professor Pedrizet of Nancy University, took over the direction of the firm, but the new management did not keep up with the new styles, and the firm went out of business in 1931.  Only the carved wooden door survives of his original studio, now in the garden of the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole de Nancy]]. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=54-55}}\n\nGall\u00e9 wrote a book on art entitled ''\u00c9crits pour l'art 1884-89'' (\"Writings on Art 1884-89\"), which was published posthumously in 1908.<ref>''Ecrits pour l'art'' ed Henrietta Galle Paris 1908/Marseille 1980</ref>\n\n==Glassware==\n\n===Cased glass,  cameo glass and enamel glass===\nCased glass and cameo glass were two techniques often used by Gall\u00e9.  Cased glass was made of two different layers of glass of different colors, fused together by heat. The first case of layer is made in a cold.  When it is finished and cooled, a second layer is blown inside the first Then the piece is placed into the furnace, so the two layers fuse together. This could be repeated for multiple layers of glass. Cameo glass was a means of decorating cased glass.  The cased glass of two or more colors was carved with a diamond saw or etched with acid, so that the colors of the layer underneath were visible and created a design. Enamel glass was decorated on the outside by a brush of enamels colored by metallic oxides.  .{{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=195}}\n\n===Glass marquetry and patinated glass===\nGall\u00e9 continually experimented with new techniques of glass art. One of his major innovations was glass marquetry, or applying layers of glass on an object. He attached then sheets of colored glass onto a hot glass object He could join the laminations or overlay them, adding an infinite number of layers and colors. This technique had been practiced by the Venetians during the Renaissance, but Gall\u00e9 pushed it much further. While it allowed him almost limitless variations, it also presented great difficulties, since the glass had to be reheated for each new layer, and could easily crack. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=195}}\n\nAnother difficulty was the appearance of defects and imperfections caused by contamination of the glass paste bu dust or ashes or other materials, which caused what glassmakers called \"bubbles\", \"grease\" or stitches\" inside the glass. Galle\u00e9 decided to take advantage of the defects. He wrote in his patent application, \"Concerned about such defects, I had the idea of using them as a decorative means, which permitted me, by inducing the effect in various ways, to obtain an entirely new type of decoration, called ''patina''.\"  Gall\u00e9 proposed dusting the surface of the hot glass, which would give the appearance of fabric, or thick cobweb, or other textures. He proposed to make further decoration the surface with engraving, sand blasting, and wheel carving, and to embed fragments of hot glass into this patina or outer layer.  The final result would then be covered with a thin layer of clear crystal, which could be left plain or also patinated.{{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=195}} \n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Petit vase craquel\u00e9.jpg|Crackled glass vase with praying mantis overlay.

As early as 1878 he colored glass with a small quantity of cobalt oxide to make a delicate sapphire tone which he called \"Clair de lune\", or \"moonlight\".  He sometimes covered this with a glaze of cobalt blue.  It was widely imitated by other glassmakers, particularly in Germany and England,  where it was called \"mondscheim\", or \"moonlight\".  He wrote that he created \"yellows, some iridescent browns and greens with a base of silver and sulphur, a peacock blue with copper and iron, browns from sulphur and catechu.\"  He also tried out rare metals such as [[thallium]] and [[iridium]], which made particularly dark shadows.  His most original and characteristic colors were a deep violet made with [[manganese]], usually on an [[opaline]] ground; a pink made with selenium or copper, which he created 1889; and a green made with ''chromium'', which he used to case pieces in three or four layers, giving nn exceptional depth and richness of color. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}} \n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Claire de Lune vase Emile Galle1884.jpg|\"Moonlight blue\" vase, blown, molded, enamelled and engraved on wheel(1884)\nFile:Emile Gall\u00e9, coppa 'In una notte come questa', nancy 1894.JPG|Cup with \"Peacock blue\" (1894)\nFile:Coupe Rose de France.JPG|\"Rose de France\" cup (1901) (Mus\u00e9e de l'Ecole de Nancy)\nFile:Vase, Emile Galle, Nancy, c. 1898, glass - Br\u00f6han Museum, Berlin - DSC03963.JPG|Vase with chromium green (1898) (Brohan Museum)\nFile:Cylindrical vase by Emile Galle, c. 1900, glass - Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt - Darmstadt, Germany - DSC00958.jpg|Cylindrical vase with flowers (Darmstadt Colony Museum)\nFile:\u00c9mile gall\u00e9, vaso, orph\u00e9e, da victor prouv\u00e9, nancy 1888-89.JPG|\"Orpheus\" vase, with art by [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]] (1888\u201389)\n</gallery>\n\nHiis style, with its emphasis on naturalism and floral motifs, was at the forefront of the emerging Art Nouveau movement.<ref>William Warmus.

He was a dedicated botanist, and had an extensive flower garden at this residence as a source of models. He also required his artists to use actual plants as models if they were depicting them.  They also had a strong symbolic appeal for Gall\u00e9. He wrote in 1893 that according to Saint Paul each flower and fruit has a particular symbolic meaning; the olive leaf is peace, wheat is charity and goodness; the grape is the symbol of the [[Eucharist]]; the fig is generosity; the [[Veronica (plant)|Veronica flower]] is fidelity, the [[myrtus communis|myrtle]] is joy, the [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]] is springtime in nature, and so forth.\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Vase aux bleuets.jpg|Vase with Bleuet flowers, \"Moonlight blue\" polychrome glass with enamel flowers, speckles   (1879)\nFile:Vase Orchid\u00e9e.jpg|Orchid vase (1897).

He was intrigued by the extraordinary variety of colors and reflective qualities of the woods being imported into Europe from colonies around the world. Within a year, he had created his own furniture workshop, employing experienced carpenters, sculptors, varnishers and experts in marquetry, as well as craftsmen in bronze and iron to make the knobs, locks, and other hardware. He was aided in design by experienced collaborators such as [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]]. Unlike some designers of the Arts and Crafts movement, he was willing to use machine tools to speed up the manufacture, if it did not diminish the quality of the final product. He began to experiment, sculpting the locks, using patinas of bronze and heating the locks to get exactly the color he wanted.  He created a collection of six hundred different varieties of wood.  so he could create marquetry in exactly the color and shade, and nuances of the grain he wanted. By 1889 he was able to mount a very successful display of his furniture at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Universal Exposition]]. {{sfn|Gardner (1976)| page=79-80}}\n\nHe described his inspiration for furniture design in a long article called \"Contemporary furniture decorated following nature\" published in the November\u2013December 1900 issue of the ''Revue des Arts Decoratifs''. He argued that true beauty could never be found \"in the acceptance of the falseness and mediocrity of prettiness without character or in opulence without spirit.\" He argued that it could only be found in the concentrated application of the principles of structural and linear growth of Nature,   .{{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=85}}  Following this doctrine, every detail and motif in his furniture was taken directly from nature. \n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Dawn and Dusk bed.jpg|Dawn and Dusk Bed (1901).

Tne faience, or glazed earthenware of Gall\u00e9, rarely achieved the same level of technical quality and fame as his glassware.  He largely abandoned it after 1892.  However, it contained much of the same imagination and unusual as his glass.

He was noted for his designs of [[Art Nouveau glass art]] and [[Art Nouveau furniture]], and was a founder of the [[\u00c9cole de Nancy]] or Nancy School, a movement of design in the city of [[Nancy, France]]. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early Life and Education ===\nGall\u00e9 born on March 4, 1846 in the city of [[Nancy, France]].  His father, Charles Gall\u00e9, was a merchant of glassware and ceramics who had settled in Nancy in 1844, and his father-in-law owned a factory in Nancy which manufactured mirrors.  His father took over the direction of his mother's family business, and began to manufacture glassware with a floral design. He also took over a struggling [[faience]] factory and began make new products.  {{sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1980)|page=52}}\n\nThe young Gall\u00e9 studied philosophy and natural science at the Lyc\u00e9e Imperial in Nancy.  At the age of sixteen he went to work for the family business as an assistant to his father, making floral designs and emblems for both faience and glass. In his spare time he became an accomplished botanist, studying with D.A. Godron, the director of the Botanical Gardens of Nancy and author of the leading textbooks on French flora. He collected plants from the region and from as far away as Italy and Switzerland. He also took courses in painting and drawing, and made numerous drawings of plants, flowers, animals and insects, which became subjects of decoration.  {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=15}} \n \nAt the age of sixteen he finished the Lyc\u00e9e in Nancy and went to [[Weimar]] in Germany from 1862-1866 to continue his studies in philosophy, botany, sculpture and drawing. In 1866, to prepare himself to inherit the family business, he went to work as an apprentice at the glass factory of Burgun and Schwerer in [[Meisenthal]], and made a serious study of the chemistry of glass production.  Some of his early glass and faience works for the family factory at Saint-Cl\u00e9mont were displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|1867 Paris Universal Exposition]]. In early 1870 he designed a complete set of dishware with a rustic animal designs for the family enterprise. During this time he became acquainted with the painter, sculptor and engraver [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]], an artist of the romantic \"troubadour\" style, who became his future collaborator in the Nancy School. {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=16}}\n\nHe enlisted for military service in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, then was demobilised after the disastrous French defeat in 1871 and the French loss to Germany of much of the province of [[Lorraine]], including [[Meisenthal]] where he done his apprenticeship.  Thereafter the [[Cross of Lorraine]], the patriotic symbol of the region, became part of his signature on many of his works of art.\n\nAfter his demobilization Gall\u00e9 went to London, where he represented his father at an exhibition of the arts of France, then to Paris, where he remained for several months, visiting the Louvre and [[Cluny Museum]], studying examples of ancient Egyptian art, Roman glassware and ceramics, and especially early Islamic enamelled glass, a technique which influenced his own later work.  After further travel to Switzerland and Italy, he returned to Nancy and established his own workshop at the glass factory. His father Charles continued as head of the company, but \u00c9mile gradually took charge of the design and production, \nIn 1873 he took up residence in La Garenne (\"the rabbit warren\"), the three-story neoclassical house built by his father and surrounded by gardens. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Gall\u00e9Maison.jpg|''la Garenne'', Gall\u00e9's house in Nancy\n</gallery>\n\n===Head of the company and international success===\nIn 1874 the elder Gall\u00e9 turned the family business, the Maison Gall\u00e9-Reinemer. over to \u00c9mile.  The following year \u00c9mile married Henriette Grimm, and after years of traveling, settled permanently in Nancy. He regrouped and reorganized the divisions of faience and glass manufacture, and in 1883 built new and larger workshops for glass and faience manufacture also for making furniture. By 1889 he had over three hundred employees. His own office and studio was in the center of the complex. He trained the designers himself, and sent them water colors of floral designs he made in the gardens of his residence,  Gall\u00e9 ordered his designers to use only real flowers and plants as their models, though they could take some liberties in the final design. He wrote in 1889, \"it is necessary to have a pronounced bias in favour of models taken from flora and fauna, while giving them free expression.\" {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}}\n\nGall\u00e9 continued to expand his activities,  In 1885 He opened his first shop in Paris at 12 rue Richter, followed by other shops in Frankfurt-am-Maine and London. He also took part on a grand scale in international expositions; beginning with the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Universal Exposition]], where his pavilion was thirty meters long; the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago; and especially the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition]], which was the summit of his fame, His work at the Exposition was rewarded with two Grand Prizes, a Gold Medal, and the title of a commander in the [[Legion of Honor]].{{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Atelier di disegno di \u00e9mile gall\u00e9 a nancy, modlelo di quattro facce per due vasi, 1885 ca.JPG|Designs of two vases by Gall\u00e9 (1885)\nFile:Atelier di disegno di \u00e9mile gall\u00e9 a nancy, vaso con trota e mosca, 1885-1900 ca.JPG|Design for a vase with a trout catching a fly (1895-1900)\nFile:Vase MET SF2008 113 mark.jpg|Mark of Gall\u00e9 with the Cross of Lorraine emblem\n</gallery>\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1901, Gall\u00e9 became the founder and first President of the [[\u00c9cole de Nancy]], the organization of Nancy artists of the new style. created to encourage the arts in Nancy, the glassmaker [[Daum (studio)|Antonin Daum]], furniture maker [[Louis Majorelle]] and [[Eugene Vallin]] as Vice Presidents. He had many distinguished patrons, including the [[Edmond James de Rothschild]], and his works were purchased by museums.  In the highest form of tribute, his works were imitated by other glass and ceramics firms. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}}\n\nMuch of his later work used symbolism, and expressed conflict. On one vase, called ''Fiori Oscuri''\nhe engraved the words of [[Robert de Montesquiou]]: \"I love the hour when everything changes its form, when light and dark struggle together.\" {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=136}}\n\nHe became involved in social causes. He was a founder, along with Victor Prouv\u00e9, of the Universit\u00e9 populaire de Nancy, offering university-level classes to workers.  He was treasurer of the Nancy branch of the Human Rights League of France and in 1898, at great risk for his business, one of the first to become actively involved in the defense of [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. He also publicly defended the Romanian Jews and spoke up in defense of the Irish Catholics in Britain, and supported William O\u2019Brien, one of the leaders of the Irish revolt.<ref name=\"Maitre\">''Emile Gall\u00e9 : ma\u00eetre de l'art nouveau'', Fran\u00e7ois Le Tacon; prologue by Henri Claude. 2004 - {{ISBN|2-7165-0620-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1904, his health worsened.  He was diagnosed with [[Leukemia]], and died on September 23, 1904.  His son-in-law, Professor Pedrizet of Nancy University, took over the direction of the firm, but the new management did not keep up with the new styles, and the firm went out of business in 1931.  Only the carved wooden door survives of his original studio, now in the garden of the [[[[Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole de Nancy]]. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=54-55}}\n\nGall\u00e9 wrote a book on art entitled ''\u00c9crits pour l'art 1884-89'' (\"Writings on Art 1884-89\"), which was published posthumously in 1908.<ref>''Ecrits pour l'art'' ed Henrietta Galle Paris 1908/Marseille 1980</ref>\n\n==Glassware==\n\n===Cased glass,  cameo glass and enamel glass===\nCased glass and cameo glass were two techniques often used by Gall\u00e9.  Cased glass was made of two different layers of glass of different colors, fused together by heat. The first case of layer is made in a cold.  When it is finished and cooled, a second layer is blown inside the first Then the piece is placed into the furnace, so the two layers fuse together. This could be repeated for multiple layers of glass. Cameo glass was a means of decorating cased glass.  The cased glass of two or more colors was carved with a diamond saw or etched with acid, so that the colors of the layer underneath were visible and created a design. Enamel glass was decorated on the outside by a brush of enamels colored by metallic oxides.  {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=195}}.\n\n===Glass marquetry and patinated glass===\nGall\u00e9 continually experimented with new techniques of glass art. One of his major innovations was glass marquetry, or applying layers of glass on an object. He attached then sheets of colored glass onto a hot glass object He could join the laminations or overlay them, adding an infinite number of layers and colors. This technique had been practiced by the Venetians during the Renaissance, but Gall\u00e9 pushed it much further. While it allowed him almost limitless variations, it also presented great difficulties, since the glass had to be reheated for each new layer, and could easily crack. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=195}} \n\nAnother difficulty was the appearance of defects and imperfections caused by contamination of the glass paste bu dust or ashes or other materials, which caused what glassmakers called \"bubbles\", \"grease\" or stitches\" inside the glass. Galle\u00e9 decided to take advantage of the defects. He wrote in his patent application, \"Concerned about such defects, I had the idea of using them as a decorative means, which permitted me, by inducing the effect in various ways, to obtain an entirely new type of decoration, called ''patina''.\"  Gall\u00e9 proposed dusting the surface of the hot glass, which would give the appearance of fabric, or thick cobweb, or other textures. He proposed to make further decoration the surface with engraving, sand blasting, and wheel carving, and to embed fragments of hot glass into this patina or outer layer.  The final result would then be covered with a thin layer of clear crystal, which could be left plain or also patinated.{{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=195}} \n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Petit vase craquel\u00e9.jpg|Crackled glass vase with praying mantis overlay.

As early as 1878 he colored glass with a small quantity of cobalt oxide to make a delicate sapphire tone which he called \"Clair de lune\", or \"moonlight\".  He sometimes covered this with a glaze of cobalt blue.  It was widely imitated by other glassmakers, particularly in Germany and England,  where it was called \"mondscheim\", or \"moonlight\".  He wrote that he created \"yellows, some iridescent browns and greens with a base of silver and sulphur, a peacock blue with copper and iron, browns from sulphur and catechu.\"  He also tried out rare metals such as [[thallium]] and [[iridium]], which made particularly dark shadows.  His most original and characteristic colors were a deep violet made with [[manganese]], usually on an [[opaline]] ground; a pink made with selenium or copper, which he created 1889; and a green made with ''chromium'', which he used to case pieces in three or four layers, giving nn exceptional depth and richness of color. {{Sfn|Bloch-Dermant (1974)|page=53-54}} \n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Claire de Lune vase Emile Galle1884.jpg|\"Moonlight blue\" vase, blown, molded, enamelled and engraved on wheel(1884)\nFile:Emile Gall\u00e9, coppa 'In una notte come questa', nancy 1894.JPG|Cup with \"Peacock blue\" (1894)\nFile:Coupe Rose de France.JPG|\"Rose de France\" cup (1901) (Mus\u00e9e de l'Ecole de Nancy)\nFile:Vase, Emile Galle, Nancy, c. 1898, glass - Br\u00f6han Museum, Berlin - DSC03963.JPG|Vase with chromium green (1898) (Brohan Museum)\nFile:Cylindrical vase by Emile Galle, c. 1900, glass - Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt - Darmstadt, Germany - DSC00958.jpg|Cylindrical vase with flowers (Darmstadt Colony Museum)\nFile:\u00c9mile gall\u00e9, vaso, orph\u00e9e, da victor prouv\u00e9, nancy 1888-89.JPG|\"Orpheus\" vase, with art by [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]] (1888-89)\n</gallery>\n\nHiis style, with its emphasis on naturalism and floral motifs, was at the forefront of the emerging Art Nouveau movement.<ref>William Warmus.

Exhibition catalog, which includes several pages of translations into English of Galle's \"Ecrits pour l'art\" (pp.181-9)</ref>\n\nHis early work was executed using clear glass decorated with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], but he soon turned to an original style featuring heavy, opaque [[cut glass|glass carved]] or etched with plant motifs, often in two or more colors as [[cameo glass]]. \n\nHe continued to incorporate experimental techniques into his work, such as metallic foils and air bubbles, and also revitalized the glass industry by establishing a workshop to mass-produce his, and other artists', designs.\n\n===Flowers===\nA large number of his glass works, especially vases,  are inspired by and named for flowers. He was a dedicated botanist, and had an extensive flower garden at this residence as a source of models. He also required his artists to use actual plants as models if they were depicting them.  They also had a strong symbolic appeal for Gall\u00e9. He wrote in 1893 that according to Saint Paul each flower and fruit has a particular symbolic meaning; the olive leaf is peace, wheat is charity and goodness; the grape is the symbol of the [[Eucharist]]; the fig is generosity; the [[Veronica (plant)|Veronica flower]] is fidelity, the [[myrtus communis|myrtle]] is joy, the [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]] is springtime in nature, and so forth.\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Vase aux bleuets.jpg|Vase with Bleuet flowers, \"Moonlight blue\" polychrome glass with enamel flowers, speckles   (1879)\nFile:Vase Orchid\u00e9e.jpg|Orchid vase (1897).

He was intrigued by the extraordinary variety of colors and reflective qualities of the woods being imported into Europe from colonies around the world. Within a year, he had created his own furniture workshop, employing experienced carpenters, sculptors, varnishers and experts in marquetry, as well as craftsmen in bronze and iron to make the knobs, locks, and other hardware. He was aided in design by experienced collaborators such as [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]]. Unlike some designers of the Arts and Crafts movement, he was willing to use machine tools to speed up the manufacture, if it did not diminish the quality of the final product. He began to experiment, sculpting the locks, using patinas of bronze and heating the locks to get exactly the color he wanted.  He created a collection of six hundred different varieties of wood.  so he could create marquetry in exactly the color and shade, and nuances of the grain he wanted. By 1889 he was able to mount a very successful display of his furniture at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Universal Exposition]]. {{sfn|Gardner (1976)| page=79-80}}\n\nHe described his inspiration for furniture design in a long article called \"Contemporary furniture decorated following nature\" published in the November-December 1900 issue of the ''Revue des Arts Decoratifs''. He argued that true beauty could never be found \"in the acceptance of the falseness and mediocrity of prettiness without character or in opulence without spirit.\" He argued that it could only be found in the concentrated application of the principles of structural and linear growth of Nature,   {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=85}}.  Following this doctrine, every detail and motif in his furniture was taken directly from nature. \n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:Dawn and Dusk bed.jpg|Dawn and Dusk Bed (1901).

Tne faience, or glazed earthenware of Gall\u00e9, rarely achieved the same level of technical quality and fame as his glassware.  He largely abandoned it after 1892.  However, it contained much of the same imagination and unusual as his glass.  His ceramics and glazed earthenware of Gall\u00e9 oftenl, looked like real earth, employing earthy brown colors, with overlays of leaves and insects {{Sfn|Gardner (1976)|page=65-75}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"180\">\nFile:\u00c9mile gall\u00e9, servito fiori araldici, 1878 circa, vassoio con pavone.jpg|Ceramic plate with peacock (1878)\nFile:Vase MET ES5392.jpg|Glazed earthenware vase (Metropolitan Museum) (1885)\nFile:Vase MET SF1999 398 1.jpg|Glazed earthenware vase (1880-1885) (Metropolitan Museum)\nFile:Vase MET SF2008 113 img1.jpg|Earthenware vase and sculpted stand (1884) (Metropolitan Museum)\nFile:Vase (France), 1884\u201389 (CH 18634943).jpg|Faience or earthenware vase with two feet, with mountain night scene on the back and a floral daylight scene with butterfly on the front.(1884-1885)\nFile:Dish MET ES5405.jpg|Glazed earthenware dish with floral and insect designs (1885) (Metropolitan Museum)\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Bloch-Dermant|first=Janine|title=The Art of French Glass (1860-1914)|publisher=The Vendome Press|language=English|year=1980|isbn=0-86565-000-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fahr-Becker|first=Gabriele|title=L'Art Nouveau|publisher=H.F.

[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (August 24, 2007 entry) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ (Retrieved February 17, 2010)</ref>\n\nMuch of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their [[social integration|integrity and coherence]] in [[modernity]], an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social [[institutions]] have come into being. His first major sociological work was ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology.<ref name=\"Allan_104\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=104}}</ref> In 1898, he established the journal ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a study of [[suicide]] rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]]. ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.\n\nDurkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate [[science]]. He refined the [[positivism]] originally set forth by [[Auguste Comte]], promoting what could be considered as a form of [[epistemological]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]], as well as the use of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] in social science. For him, sociology was the science of [[institution]]s, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity\"<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1982|p=45}}</ref> and its aim being to discover structural [[social fact]]s. Durkheim was a major proponent of [[structural functionalism]], a foundational perspective in both sociology and [[anthropology]]. In his view, social science should be purely [[holism|holistic]];<ref name=socialfacts>{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=\u00c9mile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895|page=14|quote=The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things.}}</ref> that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.\n\nHe remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[morality]], [[social stratification]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[Sociology of education|education]], and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. Durkheimian terms such as \"[[collective consciousness]]\" have since entered the popular lexicon.<ref>Simpson, George (Trans.) in Durkheim, Emile \"The Division of Labour in Society\" The Free Press, New York, 1993. p. ix</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nEmile Durkheim was born 15 April 1858 in [[\u00c9pinal]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], the son of M\u00e9lanie (Isidor) and Mo\u00efse Durkheim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Biography.html|title=Emile Durkheim's Life and Works (1857\u20131917)|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z61mk-BEEQ0C&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Melanie+Isidor+Durkheim|title=For Durkheim|publisher=|isbn=9780754671558|last1=Tiryakian|first1=Edward A.|year=2009}}</ref> He came from a long line of devout [[French Jews]]; his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been [[rabbi]]s.<ref name=\"Poggi_1\">{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=1}}</ref> He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools.<ref name=\"Poggi_1\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA103 p. 103]}}</ref> Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community.<ref name=\"Poggi_1\"/> Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. [[Marcel Mauss]], a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-107\"/> One of his nieces was Claudette (n\u00e9e Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of [[Maurice Bloch]], who became a noted anthropologist.\n\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'' (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=2}}</ref> The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and [[Henri Bergson]], would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin [[dissertation]] on [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].<ref>{{harvp|Bottomore|Nisbet|1978|p=8}}</ref> At the same time, he read [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no [[social science]] curriculum at the time. Durkheim found [[Humanities|humanistic studies]] uninteresting, turning his attention from [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] to [[ethics]] and, eventually, [[sociology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> He obtained his ''[[agr\u00e9gation]]'' in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=64}}</ref>\n\nThe opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA104 p. 104]}}</ref> In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of [[empiricism]] and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian method]].<ref>{{harvp|Jones|Spiro|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vM5MgiPPlgcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA148 p. 149]}}</ref> By 1886, as part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], he had completed the draft of his ''The Division of Labour in Society'', and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\n[[File:Emile Durkheim, Le Socialisme maitrier.jpg|thumb|A collection of Durkheim's courses on the origins of socialism (1896), edited and published by his nephew, [[Marcel Mauss]], in 1928]]\n\nDurkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His official title was ''Charg\u00e9 d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de P\u00e9dagogie'' and thus he taught both [[pedagogy]] and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before).<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=3}}</ref> The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> From this position Durkheim helped reform the [[French school system]], introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.\n\nAlso in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They would have two children, Marie and Andr\u00e9.<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/>\n\nThe 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> In 1893, he published ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and [[evolution of society|its development]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=x}}</ref> Durkheim's interest in [[social phenomena]] was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to the fall of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], which was then replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new [[secularism|secular]] and [[republicanism|republican]] rule, as many people considered a vigorously [[nationalistic]] approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA105 p. 105]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'',<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> a [[manifesto]] stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In 1898, he founded ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', the first French social science journal.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'', a [[case study]] that provided an example of what a sociological [[monograph]] might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of [[quantitative methods in criminology]], which he used in his study of suicide.\n\nBy 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the [[professorship|chair]] of education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in \"Education and Sociology\".<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Because [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]] are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence\u2014his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/> In 1912, he published his last major work, ''[[The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life]]''.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Tomba emile durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|\u00c9mile Durkheim's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery]]\nThe outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] was always patriotic rather than internationalist\u2014he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist [[propaganda]] that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]]. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches.

First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed.  To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and [[social integration]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_102\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=102}}</ref> Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:\n\n{{Quote|For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=136}}</ref>}}\n\n===Inspirations===\nDuring his university studies at the \u00c9cole, Durkheim was influenced by two [[neo-Kantian]] scholars, [[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] and [[\u00c9mile Boutroux]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included [[rationalism]], scientific study of morality, anti-[[utilitarianism]] and secular education.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His methodology was influenced by [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a supporter of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], who effectively sought to extend and apply the [[scientific method]] found in the [[natural science]]s to the [[social science]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as [[Inductive reasoning|induce]] general [[scientific law]]s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] abstractions and philosophical speculation.<ref>{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=151}}</ref> At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] outlook called social [[scientific realism|realism]]. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\">{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=152}}</ref> As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the [[subjectivity|individual's perception]] of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as [[empiricism]] and [[positivism]]. Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\"/> Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \"apparent\" laws, but would be able to discover the ''inherent nature'' of society.\n\nScholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of [[Secular Jewish culture|secularized Jewish thought]],<ref>{{harvp|Strenski|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nyneB7F0m0sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 1\u20132]}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Me\u0161trovi\u0107|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lqGUxDs3K_UC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 37]}}: \"While Durkheim did not become a Rabbi, he may have transformed his father's philosophical and moral concerns into something new, his version of sociology.\"</ref> while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.<ref>{{harvp|Pickering|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=amP-MyZAL-cC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 79]}}</ref>\n\n===Establishing sociology===\nDurkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> His concern was to establish sociology as a science.<ref>{{harvp|Popolo|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vMALg_p5zHsC&pg=PA97 pp. 97\u2013]}}</ref> Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences he wrote:\n{{quote|Sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.<ref>{{harvp|Brinton|Nee|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=71e_jsQpzg0C&pg=PR11 pp. 11\u2013]}}</ref>}}\n\nTo give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own [[methodology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He argued, \"There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from ....those studied by the other natural sciences.\"<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\">{{harvp|Durkheim|2007|pp=101\u2013102, 95\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural \"[[social fact]]s\".<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"socialfact\">Durkheim, \u00c9mile [1895] \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" 8th edition, trans.

One of the questions raised concerns the [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, [[observation]] must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a \"perfectly objective observation\" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its [[Social relation|relation]] with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege [[Comparative method|comparison]] rather than the study of singular independent facts.<ref>{{harvp|Collins|1975|p=539}}: \"Durkheim was the first to seriously use the comparative method correctly in the scientific sense\".</ref>\n\nDurkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with [[Herbert Spencer]], he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society \"work\"). He also agreed with Spencer's [[organicism|organic analogy]], comparing society to a living organism.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960a}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960b}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Thompson|2002}}</ref> Durkheim also insisted that society was [[Holism|more than the sum of its parts]].<ref>\"Science cannot describe individuals, but only types.

He believed that crime is \"bound up with the fundamental conditions of all [[social relation|social life]]\" and serves a social function.<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> He stated that crime implies \"not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> Examining the [[trial of Socrates]], he argues that \"his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country\" as \"it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> As such, his crime \"was a useful prelude to reforms\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that \"the authority which the moral [[conscience]] enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/>\n\n====Suicide====\n{{main|Suicide (Durkheim book)}}\nIn ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated [[suicide]] as a [[social fact]], explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one's circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that they have not made a difference in anyone's lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to a belief that there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.\n\nThis study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],<ref>{{harvp|Stark|Bainbridge|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&pg=PA32 p. 32]}}</ref> who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant\u2013Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may have always been the [[Spurious relationship|spurious reflection]] of other factors.<ref>{{harvp|Pope|Danigelis|1981}}</ref> Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the [[Fallacy|logical error]] termed the [[ecological fallacy]].<ref>Freedman, David A. 2002. ''The Ecological Fallacy''. University of California.

The book pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of [[spirituality]] and [[God]].<ref name=\"Allan_112\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim defined religion as\n\n{{quote|A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden\u2014beliefs and practices which unite in one single [[moral community]] called a [[Church body|Church]], all those who adhere to them.|\u00c9mile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', Book 1, Ch. 1<ref name=\"Allan_115\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=115}}</ref>}}\n\nIn this definition, Durkheim avoids references to [[supernatural]] or God.<ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural\u2014that which cannot be rationally explained\u2014from natural, that which can.<ref name=\"Allan_116\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=116}}</ref> Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as [[Buddhism]], where the [[Four Noble Truths]] are much more important than any individual deity.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the [[sacred]] (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the [[belief]]s and [[ritual|practices]] (which create highly emotional state\u2014[[collective effervescence]]\u2014and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the [[moral community]] (a group of people sharing a common [[moral philosophy]]).<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=116, 118, 120, 137}}</ref> Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> He defined sacred things as:\n\n{{quote|...simply collective ideals that have fixed themselves on material objects... they are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim saw religion as the most fundamental [[social institution]] of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/> It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=\"Allan_114\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=114}}</ref> Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early [[hunter and gatherer]] societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> However, Durkheim also believed that [[religion]] was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by [[science]] and the cult of an individual.<ref name=\"Allan_132-133\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/>\n\n{{quote|Thus there is something eternal in religion that is destined to outlive the succession of particular symbols in which religious thought has clothed itself.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>}}\n\nHowever, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as \"a period of transition and moral mediocrity\".<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>\n\nDurkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/> It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing [[category of being|categories]] as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|McKinnon|2014}}</ref> Our understanding of the world is shaped by [[social facts]]; for example the notion of [[time]] is defined by being measured through a [[calendar]], which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim states that, \"Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/>\n\nIn his work, Durkheim focused on [[totemism]], the religion of the [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/>\n\n{{Quote|text=Now the totem is the flag of the clan.

(1964). ''The elementary forms of the religious life.'' London: Allen & Unwin.</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, [[Arnold van Gennep]], an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were \"entirely erroneous\". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.<ref>{{harvp|Thomassen|2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, \"have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization\".<ref>http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/forms.html#pgfId=5658; section 7 \"Critical Remarks.\"</ref>\n\n===Sociology and philosophy===\n\n====Sociology of knowledge====\n\nWhile Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, [[social structure]]s, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.\n\nWhile publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 ''magnum opus'' ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.<ref>Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e \u00e9dition, 2003 {{p.|628}}</ref> In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.<ref>Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, {{p.|14-17}}, and {{p.|19-22}}.</ref>\n\nAnother key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' ([[collective representations]]), which is outlined in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. ''Repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).<ref name=\"Durkheim, Emile 1964\"/>\n\nArguably the most important \"repr\u00e9sentation collective\" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'repr\u00e9sentations collectives', and language in particular:\n<blockquote>add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.<ref>Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, \"Elementary Forms of Religious Life\" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].\n\n====Morality====\n\nDurkheim defines morality as \"a system of rules for conduct\".<ref>Durkheim, \u00c9mile. Sociologie et Philosophie. PUF. Paris, 2004. {{p.|50}}.</ref> His analysis of morality is strongly marked by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.\n\nDurkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, \"a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character\".<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=38}}</ref> Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the [[categorical imperative]]. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common [[Summum bonum|Good]], and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=54}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Deviance====\n{{Quote frame |quote=How many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! |author=\u00c9mile Durkheim |title=''[[The Division of Labour in Society#DivisionofLabourinSociety|''Division of Labour in Society'']]'' |source=<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=T.

First, Durkheim thought that deviance could challenge the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society.<ref name=\"Textbook\" /> Secondly, deviant acts could also support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors.<ref name=\"Textbook\"/> Finally, Durkheim believed that reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity.<ref name=\"UMN Textbook\">{{cite book|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/7-2-explaining-deviance/|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World; Explaining Deviance|publisher=University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing|isbn=978-1-946135-24-7|edition=2016|location=Section 7.2|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> Durkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to [[Strain theory (sociology)#Merton'sTheory|Robert Merton's Strain Theory]] <ref name=\"Textbook\"/>\n\n==Influences and legacy==\n\nDurkheim had an important impact on the development of Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as [[Marcel Mauss]], but also later thinkers, such as [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], and [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as [[Steven Lukes]], Robert N. Bellah, and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of [[Ziya G\u00f6kalp]], the founding father of Turkish sociology.<ref name=\"Turkay Salim Nefes\">{{harvp|Nefes|2013}}</ref> [[Randall Collins]] has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with [[Erving Goffman]]'s micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the [[interaction order]].\n\nOutside of sociology, he influenced philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and his ideas can be found latently in the work of certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Michel Foucault]].<ref>{{harvp|Bourdieu|Passeron|1967|pp=167\u2013168}}: \"For, speaking more generally, all the social sciences now live in the house of Durkheimism, unbeknownst to them, as it were, because they walked into it backwards.\"</ref>\n\n===Durkheim contra Searle===\nMuch of Durkheim's work, however, remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof one can look to [[John Searle]], who wrote a book ''The Construction of Social Reality'', in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. [[Neil Gross]] however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.<ref>{{harvp|Gross|2006}}</ref> Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, \"Because Durkheim\u2019s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\"<ref>{{harvp|Searle|2006}}</ref> Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Gilbert pro Durkheim===\nA contemporary philosopher of social phenomena who has offered a sympathetic close reading of Durkheim's discussion of social facts in chapter 1 and the prefaces of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' is [[Margaret Gilbert]]. In chapter 4, section 2, of her 1989 book ''On Social Facts'' (whose title may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his \"faits sociaux\") Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Montesquieu's contributions to the formation of social science'' (1892)\n* ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895)\n* ''On the Normality of Crime'' (1895)\n* ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897)\n* ''The Prohibition of Incest and its Origins'' (1897), published in ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;1\u201370\n* ''Sociology and its Scientific Domain'' (1900), translation of an Italian text entitled \"La sociologia e il suo dominio scientifico\"\n* ''Primitive Classification'' (1903), in collaboration with [[Marcel Mauss]]\n* ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912)\n* ''Who Wanted War?''

[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (August 24, 2007 entry) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ (Retrieved February 17, 2010)</ref>\n\nMuch of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their [[social integration|integrity and coherence]] in [[modernity]], an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social [[institutions]] have come into being. His first major sociological work was ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology.<ref name=\"Allan_104\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=104}}</ref> In 1898, he established the journal ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a study of [[suicide]] rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]]. ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.\n\nDurkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate [[science]]. He refined the [[positivism]] originally set forth by [[Auguste Comte]], promoting what could be considered as a form of [[epistemological]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]], as well as the use of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] in social science. For him, sociology was the science of [[institution]]s, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity\"<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1982|p=45}}</ref> and its aim being to discover structural [[social fact]]s. Durkheim was a major proponent of [[structural functionalism]], a foundational perspective in both sociology and [[anthropology]]. In his view, social science should be purely [[holism|holistic]];<ref name=socialfacts>{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=\u00c9mile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895|page=14|quote=The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things.}}</ref> that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.\n\nHe remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[morality]], [[social stratification]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[Sociology of education|education]], and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]].

While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community.<ref name=\"Poggi_1\"/> Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. [[Marcel Mauss]], a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-107\"/> One of his nieces was Claudette (n\u00e9e Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of [[Maurice Bloch]], who became a noted anthropologist.\n\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'' (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=2}}</ref> The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and [[Henri Bergson]], would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin [[dissertation]] on [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].<ref>{{harvp|Bottomore|Nisbet|1978|p=8}}</ref> At the same time, he read [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no [[social science]] curriculum at the time. Durkheim found [[Humanities|humanistic studies]] uninteresting, turning his attention from [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] to [[ethics]] and, eventually, [[sociology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> He obtained his ''[[agr\u00e9gation]]'' in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=64}}</ref>\n\nThe opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA104 p. 104]}}</ref> In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of [[empiricism]] and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian method]].<ref>{{harvp|Jones|Spiro|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vM5MgiPPlgcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA148 p. 149]}}</ref> By 1886, as part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], he had completed the draft of his ''The Division of Labour in Society'', and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\n[[File:Emile Durkheim, Le Socialisme maitrier.jpg|thumb|A collection of Durkheim's courses on the origins of socialism (1896), edited and published by his nephew, [[Marcel Mauss]], in 1928]]\n\nDurkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His official title was ''Charg\u00e9 d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de P\u00e9dagogie'' and thus he taught both [[pedagogy]] and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before).<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=3}}</ref> The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> From this position Durkheim helped reform the [[French school system]], introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.\n\nAlso in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They would have two children, Marie and Andr\u00e9.<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/>\n\nThe 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> In 1893, he published ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and [[evolution of society|its development]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=x}}</ref> Durkheim's interest in [[social phenomena]] was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to the fall of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], which was then replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new [[secularism|secular]] and [[republicanism|republican]] rule, as many people considered a vigorously [[nationalistic]] approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\">{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA105 p. 105]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'',<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> a [[manifesto]] stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In 1898, he founded ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', the first French social science journal.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'', a [[case study]] that provided an example of what a sociological [[monograph]] might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of [[quantitative methods in criminology]], which he used in his study of suicide.\n\nBy 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the [[professorship|chair]] of education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in \"Education and Sociology\".<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Because [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]] are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence\u2014his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"Allan_104\"/> In 1912, he published his last major work, ''[[The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life]]''.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Tomba emile durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|\u00c9mile Durkheim's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery]]\nThe outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] was always patriotic rather than internationalist\u2014he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist [[propaganda]] that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]]. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, Andr\u00e9, died on the war front in December 1915\u2014a loss from which Durkheim never recovered.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_105\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=105}}</ref> Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a [[stroke]] in Paris on November 15, 1917.<ref name=\"Allan_105\"/> He was buried at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name=Pickering>{{harvp|Pickering|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUl5F0uLrkUC&pg=PA11&dq=%C3%89mile+Durkheim+Cimeti%C3%A8re+de+Montparnasse&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQuwUwAWoVChMIsdXQ0OzvxwIVgQ-SCh0SxwMj#v=onepage&q=%C3%89mile%20Durkheim%20Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Montparnasse&f=false p. 11]}}</ref>\n\n==Durkheim's thought==\nThroughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed.  To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and [[social integration]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"Allan_102\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=102}}</ref> Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:\n\n{{Quote|For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=136}}</ref>}}\n\n===Inspirations===\nDuring his university studies at the \u00c9cole, Durkheim was influenced by two [[neo-Kantian]] scholars, [[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] and [[\u00c9mile Boutroux]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included [[rationalism]], scientific study of morality, anti-[[utilitarianism]] and secular education.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> His methodology was influenced by [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a supporter of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], who effectively sought to extend and apply the [[scientific method]] found in the [[natural science]]s to the [[social science]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as [[Inductive reasoning|induce]] general [[scientific law]]s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] abstractions and philosophical speculation.<ref>{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=151}}</ref> At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/>\n\nA second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] outlook called social [[scientific realism|realism]]. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\">{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=152}}</ref> As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the [[subjectivity|individual's perception]] of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as [[empiricism]] and [[positivism]]. Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves.<ref name=\"Morrison_152\"/> Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \"apparent\" laws, but would be able to discover the ''inherent nature'' of society.\n\nScholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of [[Secular Jewish culture|secularized Jewish thought]],<ref>{{harvp|Strenski|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nyneB7F0m0sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 1\u20132]}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Me\u0161trovi\u0107|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lqGUxDs3K_UC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 37]}}: \"While Durkheim did not become a Rabbi, he may have transformed his father's philosophical and moral concerns into something new, his version of sociology.\"</ref> while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.<ref>{{harvp|Pickering|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=amP-MyZAL-cC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 79]}}</ref>\n\n===Establishing sociology===\nDurkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/> His concern was to establish sociology as a science.<ref>{{harvp|Popolo|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vMALg_p5zHsC&pg=PA97 pp. 97\u2013]}}</ref> Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences he wrote:\n{{quote|Sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.<ref>{{harvp|Brinton|Nee|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=71e_jsQpzg0C&pg=PR11 pp. 11\u2013]}}</ref>}}\n\nTo give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own [[methodology]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/> He argued, \"There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from ....those studied by the other natural sciences.\"<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\">{{harvp|Durkheim|2007|pp=101\u2013102, 95\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural \"[[social fact]]s\".<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-105\"/><ref name=\"socialfact\">Durkheim, \u00c9mile [1895] \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" 8th edition, trans.

One of the questions raised concerns the [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, [[observation]] must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a \"perfectly objective observation\" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its [[Social relation|relation]] with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege [[Comparative method|comparison]] rather than the study of singular independent facts.<ref>{{harvp|Collins|1975|p=539}}: \"Durkheim was the first to seriously use the comparative method correctly in the scientific sense\".</ref>\n\nDurkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with [[Herbert Spencer]], he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society \"work\"). He also agreed with Spencer's [[organicism|organic analogy]], comparing society to a living organism.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-104\"/> Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-103\"/><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960a}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Hayward|1960b}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Thompson|2002}}</ref> Durkheim also insisted that society was [[Holism|more than the sum of its parts]].<ref>\"Science cannot describe individuals, but only types.

He believed that crime is \"bound up with the fundamental conditions of all [[social relation|social life]]\" and serves a social function.<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> He stated that crime implies \"not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> Examining the [[trial of Socrates]], he argues that \"his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country\" as \"it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> As such, his crime \"was a useful prelude to reforms\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/> In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that \"the authority which the moral [[conscience]] enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible\".<ref name=\"AppelrouthEdles2007\"/>\n\n====Suicide====\n{{main|Suicide (Durkheim book)}}\nIn ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated [[suicide]] as a [[social fact]], explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one's circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that they have not made a difference in anyone's lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to a belief that there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.\n\nThis study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],<ref>{{harvp|Stark|Bainbridge|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&pg=PA32 p. 32]}}</ref> who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant\u2013Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may have always been the [[Spurious relationship|spurious reflection]] of other factors.<ref>{{harvp|Pope|Danigelis|1981}}</ref> Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the [[Fallacy|logical error]] termed the [[ecological fallacy]].<ref>Freedman, David A. 2002. ''The Ecological Fallacy''. University of California. [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/ecofall.txt]</ref><ref>{{harvp|Selvin|1965}}</ref> However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy.<ref>{{harvp|van Poppel|Day|1996|p=500}}</ref> More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the [[Structure and agency|micro\u2013macro relations]] underlying Durkheim's work.<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Some, such as Inkeles (1959),<ref>{{harvp|Inkeles|1959}}</ref> Johnson (1965)<ref>{{harvp|Johnson|1965}}</ref> and Gibbs (1968),<ref>{{harvp|Gibbs|Martin|1958}}</ref> have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide ''sociologically'' within a [[holism|holistic]] perspective, emphasizing that \"he intended his theory to explain variation among [[social environment]]s in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals\".<ref>{{harvp|Berk|2006|p=60}}</ref>\n\nDespite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of [[Control theory (sociology)|control theory]], and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]].<ref>{{harvp|Poggi|2000|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of [[spirituality]] and [[God]].<ref name=\"Allan_112\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nDurkheim defined religion as\n\n{{quote|A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden\u2014beliefs and practices which unite in one single [[moral community]] called a [[Church body|Church]], all those who adhere to them.|\u00c9mile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', Book 1, Ch. 1<ref name=\"Allan_115\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=115}}</ref>}}\n\nIn this definition, Durkheim avoids references to [[supernatural]] or God.<ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural\u2014that which cannot be rationally explained\u2014from natural, that which can.<ref name=\"Allan_116\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=116}}</ref> Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as [[Buddhism]], where the [[Four Noble Truths]] are much more important than any individual deity.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the [[sacred]] (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the [[belief]]s and [[ritual|practices]] (which create highly emotional state\u2014[[collective effervescence]]\u2014and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the [[moral community]] (a group of people sharing a common [[moral philosophy]]).<ref>{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=116, 118, 120, 137}}</ref> Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion.<ref name=\"Allan_116\"/> He defined sacred things as:\n\n{{quote|...simply collective ideals that have fixed themselves on material objects... they are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=25}}</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim saw religion as the most fundamental [[social institution]] of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/> It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=\"Allan_114\">{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=114}}</ref> Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early [[hunter and gatherer]] societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane.<ref name=\"Allan_137\"/> However, Durkheim also believed that [[religion]] was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by [[science]] and the cult of an individual.<ref name=\"Allan_132-133\"/><ref name=\"Allan_112\"/>\n\n{{quote|Thus there is something eternal in religion that is destined to outlive the succession of particular symbols in which religious thought has clothed itself.|\u00c9mile Durkheim<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>}}\n\nHowever, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as \"a period of transition and moral mediocrity\".<ref name=\"Allan_134\"/>\n\nDurkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion.<ref name=\"Allan_113\"/> It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/> In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing [[category of being|categories]] as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref>{{harvp|McKinnon|2014}}</ref> Our understanding of the world is shaped by [[social facts]]; for example the notion of [[time]] is defined by being measured through a [[calendar]], which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/> Durkheim states that, \"Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.<ref name=\"Allan_114\"/>\n\nIn his work, Durkheim focused on [[totemism]], the religion of the [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/> Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-106\"/><ref name=\"Allan_115\"/>\n\n{{Quote|text=Now the totem is the flag of the clan.

(1964). ''The elementary forms of the religious life.'' London: Allen & Unwin.</ref>}}\n\nDurkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, [[Arnold van Gennep]], an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were \"entirely erroneous\". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.<ref>{{harvp|Thomassen|2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, \"have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization\".<ref>http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/forms.html#pgfId=5658; section 7 \"Critical Remarks.\"</ref>\n\n===Sociology and philosophy===\n\n====Sociology of knowledge====\n\nWhile Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, [[social structure]]s, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.\n\nWhile publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 ''magnum opus'' ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.<ref>Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e \u00e9dition, 2003 {{p.|628}}</ref> In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.<ref>Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, {{p.|14-17}}, and {{p.|19-22}}.</ref>\n\nAnother key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' ([[collective representations]]), which is outlined in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. ''Repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''repr\u00e9sentations collectives'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).<ref name=\"Durkheim, Emile 1964\"/>\n\nArguably the most important \"repr\u00e9sentation collective\" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'repr\u00e9sentations collectives', and language in particular:\n<blockquote>add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.<ref>Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, \"Elementary Forms of Religious Life\" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].\n\n====Morality====\n\nDurkheim defines morality as \"a system of rules for conduct\".<ref>Durkheim, \u00c9mile. Sociologie et Philosophie. PUF. Paris, 2004. {{p.|50}}.</ref> His analysis of morality is strongly marked by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.\n\nDurkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, \"a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character\".<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=38}}</ref> Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the [[categorical imperative]]. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common [[Summum bonum|Good]], and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=54}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.<ref>{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Deviance====\n{{Quote frame |quote=How many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! |author=\u00c9mile Durkheim |title=''[[The Division of Labour in Society#DivisionofLabourinSociety|''Division of Labour in Society'']]'' |source=<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=T.

More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as [[Steven Lukes]], Robert N. Bellah, and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of [[Ziya G\u00f6kalp]], the founding father of Turkish sociology.<ref name=\"Turkay Salim Nefes\">{{harvp|Nefes|2013}}</ref> [[Randall Collins]] has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with [[Erving Goffman]]'s micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the [[interaction order]].\n\nOutside of sociology, he influenced philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and his ideas can be found latently in the work of certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Michel Foucault]].<ref>{{harvp|Bourdieu|Passeron|1967|pp=167\u2013168}}: \"For, speaking more generally, all the social sciences now live in the house of Durkheimism, unbeknownst to them, as it were, because they walked into it backwards.\"</ref>\n\n===Durkheim contra Searle===\nMuch of Durkheim's work, however, remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof one can look to [[John Searle]], who wrote a book ''The Construction of Social Reality'', in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. [[Neil Gross]] however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.<ref>{{harvp|Gross|2006}}</ref> Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, \"Because Durkheim\u2019s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\"<ref>{{harvp|Searle|2006}}</ref> Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.<ref>{{harvp|Lukes|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Gilbert pro Durkheim===\nA contemporary philosopher of social phenomena who has offered a sympathetic close reading of Durkheim's discussion of social facts in chapter 1 and the prefaces of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' is [[Margaret Gilbert]]. In chapter 4, section 2, of her 1989 book ''On Social Facts'' (whose title may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his \"faits sociaux\") Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Montesquieu's contributions to the formation of social science'' (1892)\n* ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895)\n* ''On the Normality of Crime'' (1895)\n* ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897)\n* ''The Prohibition of Incest and its Origins'' (1897), published in ''[[L'Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]]'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;1\u201370\n* ''Sociology and its Scientific Domain'' (1900), translation of an Italian text entitled \"La sociologia e il suo dominio scientifico\"\n* ''Primitive Classification'' (1903), in collaboration with [[Marcel Mauss]]\n* ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912)\n* ''Who Wanted War?''
