The phrase drew international attention and widespread praise across the world. Following international attention and praise, it became an overnight sensation, gaining [[Cult following|cult status]] as a mobile-phone [[ringtone]]; spawning a [[domain name]]; a contest; T-shirt sales; a television program; and [[YouTube]] videos.\n\n== Incident ==\nAt the meeting on 10 November 2007, Ch\u00e1vez repeatedly interrupted Zapatero to call Zapatero's predecessor, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]], a \"fascist\" and \"less human than snakes\",<ref name=ShutUpBBC>{{cite news\n |url         = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7089131.stm\n |title       = Shut up, Spain king tells Chavez\n |date        = 10 November 2007\n |publisher   = BBC\n |accessdate  = 9 November 2007\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111194305/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7089131.stm\n |archivedate = 11 November 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> and accuse Aznar of having supported a [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed coup d'\u00e9tat aimed at removing Ch\u00e1vez from power]].  Zapatero had earlier irritated Ch\u00e1vez by suggesting that Latin America needed to attract more [[foreign portfolio investment|foreign capital]] to combat its \"chronic, deepening poverty\", and claimed that Ch\u00e1vez's policies scared investors out of Latin America.<ref name=ShutUpBBC /><ref name=TimeRebuke>{{cite news|author=Padgett, Tim|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1682967,00.html?imw=Y|title=Behind the King's Rebuke to Ch\u00e1vez|accessdate=14 November 2007|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=12 November 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115094835/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1682967,00.html?imw=Y|archivedate=15 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCh\u00e1vez's attacks became so strong that Zapatero rose to Aznar's defence, even though he had been severely critical of Aznar in the past. Zapatero pointed out that Aznar had been democratically elected and was \"a legitimate representative of the Spanish people\".<ref name=ShutUpBBC />\n\nAlthough organizers switched off Ch\u00e1vez's microphone, he continued to interrupt as Zapatero defended Aznar.

Ch\u00e1vez defended his accusations against Aznar, arguing that prohibiting criticism of an elected official such as Aznar would be similar to prohibiting criticism of Hitler.

Previously known as '''Akbarab\u0101d''', Agra was the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] under the Badshahs [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir|Jah\u0101ng\u012br]] and [[Shah Jahan|Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n]]. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve [[subah]]s (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to [[Shahjahanabad|Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d]] in the year 1648.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=John F. |title=The Mughal Empire |date=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521566032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA119 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the [[Mughals]], it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river [[Yamuna]]. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson [[Akbar the Great]] raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\n[[File:Kos Minar 793.jpg|thumb|[[Kos Minar]] #793 at 12 mile on Agra-[[Fatehpur Sikri]] Road section of [[National Highway 21 (India)|National Highway 21]]]]\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. Built in loving memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\n\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to [[Delhi]] during his reign, but his son [[Aurangzeb]] moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n=== Later periods ===\n\nThe [[Hindu Jats|Jat]] kingdom of [[Bharatpur State|Bharatpur]] waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.<ref name=\"Unit1973\">{{cite book | title=The Gazetteer of India: History and culture | year=1973 | publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India | oclc = 186583361 | page = 348 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of [[Marathas]] and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the [[British Raj]] in 1803.\n\n[[File:Agra, Main Street, c.1858.jpg|right|thumb|Agra, Main Street, c. 1858]]\n[[File:Agra (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|left|thumb|Map of the city, c. 1914]]\nIn 1835 when the [[Presidency of Agra]] was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]]. During the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to [[Delhi]]. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June [[Gwalior]] (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.<ref name='Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago'>{{cite journal|title=Agra City|journal=Imperial Gazetteer of India (Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago)|volume=5|pages=83\u201384|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|format=GIF|accessdate=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522172131/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|archive-date=22 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as [[Din-i-Ilahi|D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b]], which flourished during the reign of [[Akbar]] and also of the [[Radha Swami|Radhaswami Faith]], which has around two million followers worldwide.

Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the [[Yamuna]] River. It can be observed from [[Agra Fort]] from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son [[Aurangzeb]]. Verses of the [[Quran]] are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and rises to a height of {{convert|80|ft|m}}; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal.

A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during [[Shah Jahan|Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n]]'s time, and reworked extensively with [[marble]] and [[pietra dura]] inlay.

In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South.

It lies about {{convert|2.34|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Taj Mahal. The pavilions in this garden are designed so that the wind from the Yamuna, combined with the greenery, keeps them cool even during the peak of summer. The original name of the gardens was \u0100r\u0101m B\u0101gh, or 'Garden of Relaxation', and this was where the Mughal emperor B\u0101bar used to spend his leisure time and where he eventually died.

This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a [[humid subtropical climate]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Agra, India\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 29\n|Feb record high C = 35.6\n|Mar record high C = 42.8\n|Apr record high C = 46.5\n|May record high C = 48.6\n|Jun record high C = 48.5\n|Jul record high C = 46.5\n|Aug record high C = 43.0\n|Sep record high C = 41.4\n|Oct record high C = 41.1\n|Nov record high C = 36.1\n|Dec record high C = 31.0\n|year record high C = 48.6\n|Jan high C = 22.3\n|Feb high C = 25.2\n|Mar high C = 32.0\n|Apr high C = 38.5\n|May high C = 41.6\n|Jun high C = 40.7\n|Jul high C = 35.2\n|Aug high C = 33.7\n|Sep high C = 34.4\n|Oct high C = 34.3\n|Nov high C = 29.7\n|Dec high C = 24.0\n|year high C = 32.6\n|Jan mean C = 15.1\n|Feb mean C = 17.8\n|Mar mean C = 24.0\n|Apr mean C = 30.5\n|May mean C = 34.0\n|Jun mean C = 34.6\n|Jul mean C = 31.1\n|Aug mean C = 29.6\n|Sep mean C = 29.4\n|Oct mean C = 27.0\n|Nov mean C = 21.7\n|Dec mean C = 16.6\n|year mean C = 26.0\n|Jan low C = 8.0\n|Feb low C = 10.4\n|Mar low C = 15.9\n|Apr low C = 22.3\n|May low C = 26.4\n|Jun low C = 28.5\n|Jul low C = 26.8\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 24.4\n|Oct low C = 19.9\n|Nov low C = 13.7\n|Dec low C = 9.1\n|year low C = 19.3\n|Jan record low C = -2.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.7\n|Mar record low C = 5.6\n|Apr record low C = 10.0\n|May record low C = 14.0\n|Jun record low C = 12.0\n|Jul record low C = 14.5\n|Aug record low C = 12.0\n|Sep record low C = 13.0\n|Oct record low C = 9.4\n|Nov record low C = 2.8\n|Dec record low C = -0.6\n|year record low C = -2.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 13.2\n|Feb rain mm = 17.6\n|Mar rain mm = 9.3\n|Apr rain mm = 6.3\n|May rain mm = 11.3\n|Jun rain mm = 55.7\n|Jul rain mm = 203.3\n|Aug rain mm = 243.2\n|Sep rain mm = 129.7\n|Oct rain mm = 24.8\n|Nov rain mm = 4.3\n|Dec rain mm = 6.1\n|year rain mm = \n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan rain days = 1.6\n|Feb rain days = 1.5\n|Mar rain days = 1.6\n|Apr rain days = 1.1\n|May rain days = 2.0\n|Jun rain days = 4.7\n|Jul rain days = 13.6\n|Aug rain days = 13.7\n|Sep rain days = 6.5\n|Oct rain days = 1.5\n|Nov rain days = 0.6\n|Dec rain days = 0.8\n|year rain days = 49.2\n|Jan humidity = 64\n|Feb humidity = 55\n|Mar humidity = 45\n|Apr humidity = 35\n|May humidity = 34\n|Jun humidity = 46\n|Jul humidity = 72\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 67\n|Oct humidity = 54\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 64\n|year humidity = 56\n|source 1 = NOAA (1971\u20131990),<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_II/IN/42261.TXT\n| title = Agra Climate Normals 1971\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 18 January 2014}}</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]] (precipitation 1901\u20132000)<ref name= WMO>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01561.htm\n| title = World Weather Information Service\u2013Agra\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 18 January 2014\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109065849/http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c01561.htm\n| archive-date = 9 January 2014\n| url-status = live\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n|source 2 = India Meteorological Department (records)<ref name=IMD>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |title=Ever recorded Maximum and minimum temperatures up to 2010 \n |publisher=India Meteorological Department \n |accessdate=18 January 2014 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GmnoaB0m?url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |archivedate=21 May 2013 \n}}</ref>\n|date = December 2010}}\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{see also|List of cities in Uttar Pradesh}}\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref name=population/><ref name=\"AGR\"/> Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053.

Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve [[subah]]s (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted his capital to [[Shahjahanabad|Sh\u0101hjah\u0101nab\u0101d]] in the year 1648.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=John F. |title=The Mughal Empire |date=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521566032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA119 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince Akbarab\u0101d was one of the most important cities in India under the [[Mughals]], it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of the river [[Yamuna]]. The garden is called the Ar\u0101m B\u0101gh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson [[Akbar the Great]] raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarab\u0101d called [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\n[[File:Kos Minar 793.jpg|thumb|[[Kos Minar]] #793 at 12 mile on Agra-[[Fatehpur Sikri]] Road section of [[National Highway 21 (India)|National Highway 21]]]]\nHis son Jah\u0101ng\u012br had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or L\u0101l Qil'a. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarab\u0101d its most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. Built in loving memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\n\nSh\u0101h Jah\u0101n later shifted the capital to [[Delhi]] during his reign, but his son [[Aurangzeb]] moved the capital back to Akbarab\u0101d, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there.\n\n=== Later periods ===\n\nThe [[Hindu Jats|Jat]] kingdom of [[Bharatpur State|Bharatpur]] waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.<ref name=\"Unit1973\">{{cite book | title=The Gazetteer of India: History and culture | year=1973 | publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India | oclc = 186583361 | page = 348 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of [[Marathas]] and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the [[British Raj]] in 1803.\n\n[[File:Agra, Main Street, c.1858.jpg|right|thumb|Agra, Main Street, c. 1858]]\n[[File:Agra (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|left|thumb|Map of the city, c. 1914]]\nIn 1835 when the [[Presidency of Agra]] was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]]. During the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to [[Delhi]]. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June [[Gwalior]] (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.<ref name='Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago'>{{cite journal|title=Agra City|journal=Imperial Gazetteer of India (Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago)|volume=5|pages=83\u201384|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|format=GIF|accessdate=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522172131/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|archive-date=22 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Legacies ===\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as [[Din-i-Ilahi|D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b]], which flourished during the reign of [[Akbar]] and also of the [[Radha Swami|Radhaswami Faith]], which has around two million followers worldwide.

Finished in marble, it is one of India's many beautiful monuments and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101, the Taj Mahal is on the south bank of the [[Yamuna]] River. It can be observed from [[Agra Fort]] from where Emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son [[Aurangzeb]]. Verses of the [[Quran]] are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and rises to a height of {{convert|80|ft|m}}; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal.

A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during [[Shah Jahan|Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n]]'s time, and reworked extensively with [[marble]] and [[pietra dura]] inlay.

In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Sh\u012bvaj\u012b stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South.

It lies about {{convert|2.34|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Taj Mahal. The pavilions in this garden are designed so that the wind from the Yamuna, combined with the greenery, keeps them cool even during the peak of summer. The original name of the gardens was \u0100r\u0101m B\u0101gh, or 'Garden of Relaxation', and this was where the Mughal emperor B\u0101bar used to spend his leisure time and where he eventually died.

These are paid for by taxes on property within the boundaries of the village, which are collected by the Brookhaven [[Receiver of Taxes]]. Education is the responsibility of the [[South Country Central School District]], ambulance service is provided by the [[South Country Ambulance Company]], fire service by the [[Bellport Fire District]], and police service by the [[Suffolk County Police Department]] and Bellport Code Enforcement.\n\n==Local business==\nThere are many small businesses such as antique shops, artist galleries, restaurants, and a service center. These family run businesses get community support through the Bellport Chamber of Commerce. Bellport is also home to the [[Gateway Playhouse]], a professional summer theater in operation since 1950.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\nThe land that is now Bellport was purchased along with what is now [[Brookhaven (CDP), New York|Brookhaven]] [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] (then called [[Fireplace Neck]]) and western [[Southaven]] from the [[Unkechogue]] Indians in 1664 by settlers from nearby [[Setauket]], who were attracted by the plentiful harvests of [[salt hay]]. The part that became Bellport was named Occumbomock Neck. Jonathan Rose was the first permanent settler in the 1680s, and by 1720 the Rose family owned much of Occumbomock Neck. In 1829, Captain Thomas Bell, a Scottish immigrant, bought land there. He sold sections of it, and by 1843 the village had 30 dwellings and 200 inhabitants. He changed the name to Bell-Port (now Bellport),<ref>Cities That Ring by Marcia A. Mitchell</ref> envisioning a seaport, since Bellport was very close to the Old Inlet, a breach in the barrier island Fire Island, which gave Bellport easy access to the open ocean. With Colonel William Howell, Bell built a dock and a road to the dock. The breach healed over, however, and Bellport instead became a tourist attraction, with wealthy visitors coming by railroad and then coach from New York City. Although all seven hotels eventually closed, the last in the 1950s, Bellport remained associated with wealthy New Yorkers, who eventually established year-round residences. After [[World War II]], nearby [[Camp Upton]] was converted into [[Brookhaven National Lab]], bringing in more, highly educated, year-round residents.<ref>Bellport Village and Brookhaven Hamlet, by Victor Principe</ref>\n\nBellport was incorporated as a village in 1910.<ref name=\"incorporation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bellportvillage.org/?q=node/6|title=About our village|publisher=Incorporated Village of Bellport, NY|quote=Bellport will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its incorporation in 2010 and a gala year-long celebration is being planned.|accessdate=2009-05-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327055713/http://www.bellportvillage.org/?q=node%2F6|archivedate=27 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> On July 4, 1980, the [[Bellport Academy]] and [[Bellport Village Historic District]] were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nOn March 8, 1963, Bellport High School burned down.

Village residents and their guests are welcome to visit the beach. Surfers, sunbathers, and fishermen especially enjoy its privateness. Ho Hum Beach offers a bathing area, a screened-in snack shack and showers on the bay side of the beach. The Whalehouse Point ferry runs from the Bellport Village Marina from late May to early September. Village residents can buy round-trip ferry tickets, and their guests may ride the ferry for an increased fare. Village residents are also welcome to ride their own boats over.

The main south-to-north road is Bellport Lane, which becomes Bellport Avenue north of South Country Road. At the northern village border, the principal south-to-north route shifts to Station Road and runs toward West Yaphank, while Bellport Avenue becomes a minor local street which terminates at a dead end on the Montauk Branch of the LIRR, only to resume its trajectory between Montauk Highway and the eastbound service road of Sunrise Highway at Exit 56. Other roads include Head of the Neck Road, which runs west through east from North Bellport and skirts the village's northern border east of Fairway Drive.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bellportvillage.org/ Village of Bellport official website]\n* [http://www.bellportchamber.com/ Bellport Chamber of Commerce]\n\n \n{{BrookhavenNY}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Brookhaven, New York]]\n[[Category:Villages in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Villages in Suffolk County, New York]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1910 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                         = Bellport, New York\n|official_name            = Incorporated Village of Bellport\n|settlement_type          = [[Village (New York)|Village]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = Bellport 4 Corners; Village Bistro.JPG\n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = The Four Corners in Bellport\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n||pushpin_map             = New York\n|pushpin_label_position   = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption      = Location within the state of New York\n|pushpin_mapsize          = \n|image_map                = Bellport-ny-map.gif\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in New York|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = \n|leader_name              = \n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = \n|established_date         =\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|unit_pref                = Imperial\n|area_footnotes           = \n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 4.0\n|area_land_km2            = 3.8\n|area_water_km2           = 0.2\n|area_total_sq_mi         = \n|area_land_sq_mi          = \n|area_water_sq_mi         =\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_footnotes     = \n|population_total         = 2084\n|population_density_km2   = auto\n|population_density_sq_mi = auto\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = 8\n|elevation_ft             = 26\n|coordinates              = {{coord|40|45|25|N|72|56|30|W|region:US_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 11713\n|area_code                = [[Area code 631|631]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 36-05771\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 0943626\n|website                  = {{URL|www.bellportvillage.org}}\n|footnotes                = \n|pop_est_as_of = 2018\n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|population_est = 2056\n}}\n'''Bellport''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.

Bellport is also home to the [[Gateway Playhouse]], a professional summer theater in operation since 1950.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\nThe land that is now Bellport was purchased along with what is now [[Brookhaven (CDP), New York|Brookhaven]] [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] (then called [[Fireplace Neck]]) and western [[Southaven]] from the [[Unkechogue]] Indians in 1664 by settlers from nearby [[Setauket]], who were attracted by the plentiful harvests of [[salt hay]]. The part that became Bellport was named Occumbomock Neck. Jonathan Rose was the first permanent settler in the 1680s, and by 1720 the Rose family owned much of Occumbomock Neck. In 1829, Captain Thomas Bell, a Scottish immigrant, bought land there. He sold sections of it, and by 1843 the village had 30 dwellings and 200 inhabitants. He changed the name to Bell-Port (now Bellport),<ref>Cities That Ring by Marcia A. Mitchell</ref> envisioning a seaport, since Bellport was very close to the Old Inlet, a breach in the barrier island Fire Island, which gave Bellport easy access to the open ocean. With Colonel William Howell, Bell built a dock and a road to the dock. The breach healed over, however, and Bellport instead became a tourist attraction, with wealthy visitors coming by railroad and then coach from New York City. Although all seven hotels eventually closed, the last in the 1950s, Bellport remained associated with wealthy New Yorkers, who eventually established year-round residences. After [[World War II]], nearby [[Camp Upton]] was converted into [[Brookhaven National Lab]], bringing in more, highly educated, year-round residents.<ref>Bellport Village and Brookhaven Hamlet, by Victor Principe</ref>\n\nBellport was incorporated as a village in 1910.<ref name=\"incorporation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bellportvillage.org/?q=node/6|title=About our village|publisher=Incorporated Village of Bellport, NY|quote=Bellport will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its incorporation in 2010 and a gala year-long celebration is being planned.|accessdate=2009-05-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327055713/http://www.bellportvillage.org/?q=node%2F6|archivedate=27 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> On July 4, 1980, the [[Bellport Academy]] and [[Bellport Village Historic District]] were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nOn March 8, 1963, Bellport High School burned down.

The main south-to-north road is Bellport Lane, which becomes Bellport Avenue north of South Country Road. At the northern village border, the principal south-to-north route shifts to Station Road and runs toward West Yaphank, while Bellport Avenue becomes a minor local street which terminates at a dead end on the Montauk Branch of the LIRR, only to resume its trajectory between Montauk Highway and the eastbound service road of Sunrise Highway at Exit 56.

The success of this novel spawned so many imitations that its name was used to define a genre, which is sometimes described simply as a \"[[desert island]] story\"<ref>''Steampunk'' anthology, 2008, ed. [[Ann VanderMeer]] & [[Jeff VanderMeer]], {{ISBN|978-1-892391-75-9}}</ref> or a \"[[castaway]] narrative\".<ref>''Empire Islands: Castaways, Cannibals, And Fantasies of Conquest'', by Rebecca Weaver-Hightower, University of Minnesota P, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0816648634}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"robinsonade\" was coined by the German writer [[Johann Gottfried Schnabel]] in the Preface of his 1731 work ''[[Die Insel Felsenburg]]'' (''The Island Stronghold'').<ref>{{in lang|de}} ''[[Die Insel Felsenburg]]'', 1731, [[Johann Gottfried Schnabel]]</ref> It is often viewed as a subgenre of [[Survivalism in fiction|survivalist fiction]].\n\n==Themes==\nIn the view of Dublin-born novelist [[James Joyce]], Robinson Crusoe is a symbol of the [[British Empire]]: \"He is the true prototype of the British colonist\u2026\"<ref>James Joyce, \"Daniel Defoe\", translated from Italian manuscript and edited by Joseph Prescott, ''Buffalo Studies'' 1 (1964): 24\u201325</ref> Later works would, arguably, expand on a mythology of [[colonialism]].\n\nIn the archetypical robinsonade, the protagonist is suddenly isolated from the comforts of civilization, usually shipwrecked or marooned on a secluded and uninhabited island. He must improvise the means of his survival from the limited resources at hand.\n\nSome of the common themes include:\n* [[solitude|Isolation]] (e.g. desert island, virgin planet)\n* A new beginning for some of the characters\n*Self Reflection\n* Encounters with natives or apparent natives\n* Commentary on society\n\nSee also themes for subgenres below.\n\n===Utopianism===\nUnlike [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' and romantic works which depicted nature as idyllic, ''Crusoe'' made it unforgiving and sparse. The protagonist survives by his wits and the qualities of his cultural upbringing, which also enable him to prevail in conflicts with fellow castaways or over local peoples he may encounter.  However, he manages to wrest survival and even a certain amount of civilisation from the wilderness.  Works that followed went both in the more utopian direction (''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'') and the dystopian direction (''[[Lord of the Flies]]'').\n\n=== Inverted Crusoeism ===\nThe term ''inverted Crusoeism'' is coined by [[J. G. Ballard]]. The paradigm of Robinson Crusoe has been a recurring topic in Ballard\u2019s work<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sellars|first=Simon|title=\"Zones of Transition\": Micronationalism in the Work of J.G. Ballard|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=230\u2013248}}</ref>. Whereas the original Robinson Crusoe became a [[castaway]] against his own will, Ballard's protagonists often choose to maroon themselves; hence ''inverted Crusoeism'' (e.g., [[Concrete Island]]). The concept provides a reason as to why people would deliberately maroon themselves on a remote island; in Ballard\u2019s work, becoming a castaway is as much a healing and empowering process as an entrapping one, enabling people to discover a more meaningful and vital existence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vicente|last2=Muskat|first2=Matthias|date=2020-04-04|title=Inverted Crusoeism: Deliberately marooning yourself on an island|url=https://doi.org/10.21463/shima.14.1.16|journal=Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.21463/shima.14.1.16|issn=1834-6057}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nOne of the best known robinsonades is ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812\u201327) by Johann Rudolf Wyss, in which a shipwrecked clergyman, his wife, and his four sons manage not only to survive on their island but also to discover the good life. Jules Verne strands his castaways in ''Mysterious Island'' (1874) with only one match, one grain of wheat, a metal dog collar, and two watches.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/art/robinsonade</ref>\n\n===Robinsonade proper===\nThe robinsonade proper also contains the following themes:\n* Progress through technology\n* A storyline following the triumphs and the rebuilding of civilisation\n* Economic achievement\n* Unfriendliness of nature\n\n===Science fiction robinsonade===\nThe robinsonade genre also includes many space-travel science fiction works. The basic premise is that our astronauts arrive at new worlds, [[Terraforming|terraform]] them if necessary, then live and prosper there, building a civilization where none existed before. The vastness of interstellar space, and the constraints of relativistic physics, may keep them isolated for thousands of years from other human or non-human (possibly robotic) settlements scattered across the galaxy, hidden amongst hundreds of billions of other stars and planets; and in their new life, they may meet aliens, just as Robinson Crusoe met [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|Man Friday]].\n\nGenre SF robinsonades naturally tend to be set on uninhabited planets or satellites rather than islands. The Moon is the location of Ralph Morris's proto-SF ''The Life and Wonderful Adventures of John Daniel'' (1751), and of John W Campbell Jr's paean to human inventiveness, ''The Moon is Hell'' (1950).<ref>http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/robinsonade</ref> A classic example of an SF robinsonade which has all the elements of the robinsonade proper is [[Tom Godwin]]'s [[The Survivors (Godwin novel)|''The Survivors'']], as well as [[J. G. Ballard]]'s ''[[Concrete Island]]''. A more recent example is [[Andy Weir]]'s 2011 ''[[The Martian (Andy Weir)|The Martian]]''.<ref>http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/robinsonade</ref> Joanna Russ' [[\"We Who Are About To...]] (1977) is a radical feminist objection to the entire genre.\n\n===Apocalyptic fantasy robinsonade===\n''Sears List of Subject Headings''<ref>''Sears List of Subject Headings'', 18th ed., Joseph Miller, ed. (New York: The H. W. Wilson Co., 2004)</ref> recommends that librarians also catalog apocalyptic fantasies\u2014such as [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s popular novel ''[[The Road]]'', or even [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Starship Troopers]]''\u2014as robinsonades.\n\n==Film==\n{{expand section|date=May 2012}}\n''[[Robinson Crusoe on Mars]]'' is the story of the survivor of a space ship crash on the planet [[Mars]].\n\n''[[Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.]]'' is a 1966 comedic retelling, featuring a US Navy pilot and an [[astrochimp]] named Floyd.\n\n''[[Enemy Mine (film)|Enemy Mine]]'' is the SF story of a human and enemy alien who crash land on a barren [[planetoid]] and eventually cooperate to survive.\n\n''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]'' is the story of a human astronaut stranded on Mars after a storm forces the rest of the crew to depart and the effort to recover him.\n\n''[[Cast Away]]'' is the story of a [[FedEx]] employee ([[Tom Hanks]]) who is the sole survivor of a plane crash and is stranded on a deserted island for four years.\n\n==Comics==\nIn 1940 Mort Weisinger created [[Green Arrow]], a millionaire castaway turned to vigilante.\n\nYears later, [[Gold Key Comics]], produced a comic series, titled ''[[Space Family Robinson]]'', in the early 1960s and later producer [[Irwin Allen]], created his own version of a similar concept, about another Space Family Robinson, known as ''[[Lost in Space]]'', for [[CBS]].\n\nThe first appearance of a space-faring Robinson family (unrelated to the series' Robinsons) was in a comic book published by [[Gold Key Comics]], ''The Space Family Robinson'', December 1962. Space Family Robinson was published as a total of 59 issues, from 1962 to 1982. The first issue was published in December 1962. With issue #15 (January, 1966), the \"Lost in Space\" title was added to the cover.\n\nThe book ''Silver Age: The Second Generation of Comic Artists'' by Daniel Herman explains that when the ''Lost in Space'' TV series came out in 1965, it was obvious that it was inspired, at least in part, by the comic book, but [[CBS]], the network airing the show, had never acquired the license from [[Western Publishing]]. Rather than sue CBS or Irwin Allen, Western decided to reach a settlement which allowed them to use \"Lost in Space\" for the title of the comic book. Since CBS and Irwin Allen licensed shows to Western, Western didn't want to antagonize them. Also, the TV show title probably helped sales of the comic book.\n\n==Television==\nThe ''[[Lost in Space]]'' TV series is an adaptation of the novel ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The astronaut family of Dr. John Robinson, accompanied by an Air Force pilot and a [[robot]], set out from an overpopulated Earth in the [[spacecraft|spaceship]] ''Jupiter 2'' to visit a planet circling the star [[Alpha Centauri]] with hopes of colonizing it. Their mission in 1997 (the official launch date of the ''Jupiter 2'' was October 16, 1997) is immediately sabotaged by Dr. Zachary Smith, who slips aboard their spaceship and reprograms the robot to destroy the ship and crew.\n\nSmith is trapped aboard, and saves himself by prematurely reviving the crew from [[suspended animation]]. They save the ship, but consequent damage leaves them lost in space. Eventually they crash on an alien world, later identified as Priplanis, where they must survive a host of adventures. Smith (whom the show's writer originally intended to kill off){{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} remains through the series as a source of comedic cowardice and villainy, exploiting the forgiving (or forgetful) nature of the Robinsons.\n\n== Video games ==\nSeveral videogames have explored this theme, placing players in hostile environments where they must work towards a specific goal or merely survive. As such, robinsonade video games can be included in the broader [[survival game]] genre. A few examples of this genre are the games in the ''[[Stranded (video game)|Stranded]]'' series, ''Stranded Deep,'' ''[[The Forest (video game)|The Forest]]'' and more recently [[Minecraft]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Literature===\nOrdered by date of publication\n\n*''[[The Isle of Pines]]'' ([[Henry Neville (writer)|Henry Neville]], 1668)<ref>It has been cited as the first robinsonade before [[Robinson Crusoe|Defoe's work]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/latrobejournal/issue/latrobe-41/t1-g-t2.html|author=Derrick Moors|title=Imaginary Voyages|website=The La Troube Journal n.41|publisher=State Library of Victoria|year=1988|accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref>\n*''Die Insel Felsenburg'' ([[Johann Gottfried Schnabel]], 1731) Translation: Palisades Island: A Translation of Insel Felsenburg by J.

The success of this novel spawned so many imitations that its name was used to define a genre, which is sometimes described simply as a \"[[desert island]] story\"<ref>''Steampunk'' anthology, 2008, ed. [[Ann VanderMeer]] & [[Jeff VanderMeer]], {{ISBN|978-1-892391-75-9}}</ref> or a \"[[castaway]] narrative\".<ref>''Empire Islands: Castaways, Cannibals, And Fantasies of Conquest'', by Rebecca Weaver-Hightower, University of Minnesota P, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0816648634}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"robinsonade\" was coined by the German writer [[Johann Gottfried Schnabel]] in the Preface of his 1731 work ''[[Die Insel Felsenburg]]'' (''The Island Stronghold'').<ref>{{in lang|de}} ''[[Die Insel Felsenburg]]'', 1731, [[Johann Gottfried Schnabel]]</ref> It is often viewed as a subgenre of [[Survivalism in fiction|survivalist fiction]].\n\n==Themes==\nIn the view of Dublin-born novelist [[James Joyce]], Robinson Crusoe is a symbol of the [[British Empire]]: \"He is the true prototype of the British colonist\u2026\"<ref>James Joyce, \"Daniel Defoe\", translated from Italian manuscript and edited by Joseph Prescott, ''Buffalo Studies'' 1 (1964): 24\u201325</ref> Later works would, arguably, expand on a mythology of [[colonialism]].\n\nIn the archetypical robinsonade, the protagonist is suddenly isolated from the comforts of civilization, usually shipwrecked or marooned on a secluded and uninhabited island. He must improvise the means of his survival from the limited resources at hand.\n\nSome of the common themes include:\n* [[solitude|Isolation]] (e.g. desert island, virgin planet)\n* A new beginning for some of the characters\n*Self Reflection\n* Encounters with natives or apparent natives\n* Commentary on society\n\nSee also themes for subgenres below.\n\n===Utopianism===\nUnlike [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' and romantic works which depicted nature as idyllic, ''Crusoe'' made it unforgiving and sparse. The protagonist survives by his wits and the qualities of his cultural upbringing, which also enable him to prevail in conflicts with fellow castaways or over local peoples he may encounter.  However, he manages to wrest survival and even a certain amount of civilisation from the wilderness.  Works that followed went both in the more utopian direction (''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'') and the dystopian direction (''[[Lord of the Flies]]'').\n\n==Examples==\nOne of the best known robinsonades is ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812\u201327) by Johann Rudolf Wyss, in which a shipwrecked clergyman, his wife, and his four sons manage not only to survive on their island but also to discover the good life.

In contrast to gender essentialism, which views differences between men and women as innate, universal, and immutable, social constructionism views gender as created and influenced by society and culture, which differ according to time and place, with roles societally defined as appropriate for a person of a given sex becoming the standard against which members of that sex are measured. Theories of the social construction of gender grew out of theories in [[second-wave feminism]] in the latter half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==== Gender performativity ====\n\n{{Main|Gender performativity}}\n[[Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[gender performativity]] can be seen as a means to show \"the ways in which reified and naturalized conceptions of gender might be understood as constituted and, hence, capable of being constituted differently\".<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 519&ndash;531 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/3207893 | jstor = 3207893 | date = December 1988 | ref = harv }} [http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/TimarAndrea/17a.Butler,performative%5B1%5D.pdf Pdf.]</ref> Butler uses the phenomenological theory of acts espoused by [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], which seeks to explain the mundane way in which \"social agents constitute social reality through language, gesture, and all manner of symbolic social sign\", to create her conception of gender performativity.<ref name=\":13\" /> She begins by quoting [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir's]] claim: <blockquote href=\"Parmenides (dialogue)\">''\"...one is not born, but, rather, becomes a woman.\"''<ref>{{cite book | last = de Beauvoir | first = Simone | author-link = Simone de Beauvoir | title = The second sex | publisher = Vintage Classic | location = London | year = 2015 | origyear = 1949 | isbn = 9781784870386 }}</ref> </blockquote>This statement distinguishes sex from gender suggesting that gender is an aspect of identity that is gradually acquired.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Sex and gender in Simone de Beauvoir's ''Second Sex'' | journal = Yale French Studies| volume = | issue = 72 | pages = 35&ndash;49 | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/2930225 | jstor = 2930225 | date = 1986 | ref = harv }}</ref> This distinction between sex, as the anatomical aspects of the female body, and gender, as the cultural meaning that forms the body and the various modes of bodily articulation, means that it is \"no longer possible to attribute the values or social functions of women to biological necessity\".<ref name=\":23\" /> Butler interprets this claim as an appropriation of the doctrine of constituting acts from the tradition of phenomenology.<ref name=\":13\" /> Butler concludes that \"gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts proceed; rather, it is an identity tenuously constituted in time\u2014an identity instituted through the stylization of the body and, hence, must be understood as the mundane way in which bodily gestures, movements and enactments of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self\".<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nCandace West and Sarah Fenstermaker also conceptualize gender \"as a routine, methodical, and ongoing accomplishment, which involves a complex of perceptual, interactional and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of manly and womanly 'natures'\" in their 1995 text ''Doing Difference''.<ref name=\":53\">{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&ndash;37 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | jstor = 189596 | date =  February 1995 | ref = harv |url=http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Doing%20Difference.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThis does not mean that the material nature of the human body is denied, instead, it is re-comprehended as separate from the process by which \"the body comes to bear cultural meanings\".<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, the essence of gender is not natural because gender itself is not a natural fact<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":23\" /> but the outcome of the sedimentation of specific corporeal acts that have been inscribed through repetition and rearticulation over time onto the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> \"If the reality of gender is constituted by the performance itself, then there is no recourse to an essential and unrealized 'sex' or 'gender' which gender performances ostensibly express\".<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==== Intersectionality ====\n\n{{Main|Intersectionality}}\n{{One source|section|date=October 2017}}\nAnalyzing gender has been a concern of feminist theory. There have been many modes of understanding how gender addresses meaning,<ref name=\":43\" /> but developing such theories of gender can obscure the significance of other aspects of women's identities, such as race, class, and sexual orientation, which marginalizes the experiences and voices of women of colour, non-Western women, working-class women, queer women, and trans women.<ref name=\":43\" /> As a challenge to feminist theory, essentialism refers to the problem of theorizing gender as both an identity and a mark of difference. This refers to a problem for the concept of subjectivity presupposed by feminist theories of gender.<ref name=\":43\" /> There are arguments primarily by black and lesbian feminists that feminist theory has capitalized on the idea of gender essentialism by using the category of gender to appeal to \"women's experience\" as a whole.<ref name=\":43\" /> By doing this, feminist theory makes universalizing and normalizing claims for and about women, which are only true of white, Western, heterosexual, [[cisgender]], middle- or upper-class women,<ref name=\":43\" /> but which it implies are situations, perspectives and experiences true of all women. Patrice DiQuinzio discusses \"how critics of exclusion see this as a function of feminist theory's commitment to theorizing gender exclusively and articulating women's experiences in terms of gender alone\".<ref name=\":43\" /> Instead one must theorize feminism in a way that takes the interlocking category of experiences between race, class, gender, and sexuality into consideration; an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] model of thinking.<ref name=\":53\" />\n\n===== Mothering =====\n\nSome feminists, such as DiQuinzio and [[Nancy Chodorow]], have used the idea of a woman's essence to link gender socialization with exclusively female mothering.<ref name=\":43\" /> Butler disagreed, because not all women are mothers, due to age or personal choice, and even some mothers do not regard motherhood as the most important aspect of political struggle.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\n===== Transfeminism =====\n\n{{Main|Transfeminism}}\nFurthermore, the essentialism of gender in feminist theory presents a problem when understanding transfeminism. Instead of understanding trans studies as another subsection or subjectivity to be subsumed under the category of \"woman\", we understand the task of trans studies to be \"the breaking apart of this

In contrast to gender essentialism, which views differences between men and women as innate, universal, and immutable, social constructionism views gender as created and influenced by society and culture, which differ according to time and place, with roles societally defined as appropriate for a person of a given sex becoming the standard against which members of that sex are measured. Theories of the social construction of gender grew out of theories in [[second-wave feminism]] in the latter half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==== Gender performativity ====\n\n{{Main|Gender performativity}}\n[[Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[gender performativity]] can be seen as a means to show \"the ways in which reified and naturalized conceptions of gender might be understood as constituted and, hence, capable of being constituted differently\".<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 519&ndash;531 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/3207893 | jstor = 3207893 | date = December 1988 | ref = harv }} [http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/TimarAndrea/17a.Butler,performative%5B1%5D.pdf Pdf.]</ref> Butler uses the phenomenological theory of acts espoused by [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], which seeks to explain the mundane way in which \"social agents constitute social reality through language, gesture, and all manner of symbolic social sign\", to create her conception of gender performativity.<ref name=\":13\" /> She begins by quoting [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir's]] claim: <blockquote href=\"Parmenides (dialogue)\">''\"...one is not born, but, rather, becomes a woman.\"''<ref>{{cite book | last = de Beauvoir | first = Simone | author-link = Simone de Beauvoir | title = The second sex | publisher = Vintage Classic | location = London | year = 2015 | origyear = 1949 | isbn = 9781784870386 }}</ref> </blockquote>This statement distinguishes sex from gender suggesting that gender is an aspect of identity that is gradually acquired.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Sex and gender in Simone de Beauvoir's ''Second Sex'' | journal = Yale French Studies| volume = | issue = 72 | pages = 35&ndash;49 | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/2930225 | jstor = 2930225 | date = 1986 | ref = harv }}</ref> This distinction between sex, as the anatomical aspects of the female body, and gender, as the cultural meaning that forms the body and the various modes of bodily articulation, means that it is \"no longer possible to attribute the values or social functions of women to biological necessity\".<ref name=\":23\" /> Butler interprets this claim as an appropriation of the doctrine of constituting acts from the tradition of phenomenology.<ref name=\":13\" /> Butler concludes that \"gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts proceed; rather, it is an identity tenuously constituted in time\u2014an identity instituted through the stylization of the body and, hence, must be understood as the mundane way in which bodily gestures, movements and enactments of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self\".<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nCandace West and Sarah Fenstermaker also conceptualize gender \"as a routine, methodical, and ongoing accomplishment, which involves a complex of perceptual, interactional and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of manly and womanly 'natures'\" in their 1995 text ''Doing Difference''.<ref name=\":53\">{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&ndash;37 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | jstor = 189596 | date =  February 1995 | ref = harv |url=http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Doing%20Difference.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThis does not mean that the material nature of the human body is denied, instead, it is re-comprehended as separate from the process by which \"the body comes to bear cultural meanings\".<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, the essence of gender is not natural because gender itself is not a natural fact<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":23\" /> but the outcome of the sedimentation of specific corporeal acts that have been inscribed through repetition and rearticulation over time onto the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> \"If the reality of gender is constituted by the performance itself, then there is no recourse to an essential and unrealized 'sex' or 'gender' which gender performances ostensibly express\".<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==== Intersectionality ====\n\n{{Main|Intersectionality}}\n{{One source|section|date=October 2017}}\nAnalyzing gender has been a concern of feminist theory. There have been many modes of understanding how gender addresses meaning,<ref name=\":43\" /> but developing such theories of gender can obscure the significance of other aspects of women's identities, such as race, class, and sexual orientation, which marginalizes the experiences and voices of women of colour, non-Western women, working-class women, queer women, and trans women.<ref name=\":43\" /> As a challenge to feminist theory, essentialism refers to the problem of theorizing gender as both an identity and a mark of difference. This refers to a problem for the concept of subjectivity presupposed by feminist theories of gender.<ref name=\":43\" /> There are arguments primarily by black and lesbian feminists that feminist theory has capitalized on the idea of gender essentialism by using the category of gender to appeal to \"women's experience\" as a whole.<ref name=\":43\" /> By doing this, feminist theory makes universalizing and normalizing claims for and about women, which are only true of white, Western, heterosexual, [[cisgender]], middle- or upper-class women,<ref name=\":43\" /> but which it implies are situations, perspectives and experiences true of all women. Patrice DiQuinzio discusses \"how critics of exclusion see this as a function of feminist theory's commitment to theorizing gender exclusively and articulating women's experiences in terms of gender alone\".<ref name=\":43\" /> Instead one must theorize feminism in a way that takes the interlocking category of experiences between race, class, gender, and sexuality into consideration; an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] model of thinking.<ref name=\":53\" />\n\n===== Mothering =====\n\nSome feminists, such as DiQuinzio and [[Nancy Chodorow]], have used the idea of a woman's essence to link gender socialization with exclusively female mothering.<ref name=\":43\" /> Butler disagreed, because not all women are mothers, due to age or personal choice, and even some mothers do not regard motherhood as the most important aspect of political struggle.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\n===== Transfeminism =====\n\n{{Main|Transfeminism}}\nFurthermore, the essentialism of gender in feminist theory presents a problem when understanding transfeminism. Instead of understanding trans studies as another subsection or subjectivity to be subsumed under the category of \"woman\", we understand the task of trans studies to be \"the breaking apart of this category, particularly if that breaking requires a new articulation of the relation between sex and gender, male and female\".<ref name=\":63\">{{cite book | last = Salamon | first = Gayle | chapter =

Western astrology measures from [[Equinox]] and [[Solstice]] points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the [[tropical year]]), while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] or [[Vedic astrology]] measures along the equatorial plane ([[sidereal year]]). [[Precession]] results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the [[constellations]] that carry similar names,<ref>Bobrick (2005), pp. 10, 23.</ref> while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] measurements still correspond with the background constellations.<ref>Johnsen (2004).</ref>\n\n== Western zodiac signs ==\n=== Zodiac history and symbolism ===\n{{main|Zodiac}}\n{{further|Babylonian astrology|Hellenistic astrology|Ancient Egyptian astronomy}}\n[[Image:Sign cusps.png|250px|thumb|right|The twelve ecliptic signs.

In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]\n\nWhile Western astrology is essentially a product of Greco-Roman culture,{{Citation needed|reason=unclear as to why this is the case|date=June 2019}} some of its more basic concepts originated in Babylon. Isolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac.<ref>Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.</ref> Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.<ref>Sachs (1948), p. 289.</ref>\n\nBy the 4th century BC, [[Babylonia]]n astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astrology of [[ancient Egypt]] by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[Horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', a work that was responsible for astrology's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East, and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.\n\nThe following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss), which express the [[constellation]] they are named for. The longitude [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|intervals]], are treated as closed for the first endpoint (''a'') and open for the second (''b'') \u2013 for instance, 30\u00b0 of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. The sign numbers, 0 through 11, are seen instead of the symbols in some astronomical works.\n\nAny association of calendar dates with these signs only makes sense when referring to [[Sun sign astrology]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Sign\n! scope=\"col\" | Symbol\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Ecliptic longitude<br>(''a'' \u2264 {{math|''&lambda;''}} < ''b'')\n! scope=\"col\" | Gloss\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]\n|[[Image:Aries.svg|20px]]\n|0\n|0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0\n|The [[Sheep|Ram]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]\n|[[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]]\n|1\n|30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0\n|The [[Bull]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]\n|[[Image:Gemini.svg|20px]]\n|2\n|60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\n|The [[Twin]]s\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]\n|[[Image:Cancer.svg|20px]]\n|3\n|90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0\n|The [[Crab]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]\n|[[Image:Leo.svg|20px]]\n|4\n|120\u00b0 to 150\u00b0\n|The [[Lion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]\n|[[Image:Virgo.svg|20px]]\n|5\n|150\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n|The [[Maiden]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]\n|[[Image:Libra.svg|24px]]\n|6\n|180\u00b0 to 210\u00b0\n|The [[Weighing scale|Scales]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]\n|[[Image:Scorpio.svg|20px]]\n|7\n|210\u00b0 to 240\u00b0\n|The [[Scorpion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]\n|[[Image:Sagittarius.svg|20px]]\n|8\n|240\u00b0 to 270\u00b0\n|The [[Archery|Archer]] ([[Centaur]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]\n|[[Image:Capricorn.svg|26px]]\n|9\n|270\u00b0 to 300\u00b0\n|The [[Goat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]\n|[[Image:Aquarius.svg|24px]]\n|10\n|300\u00b0 to 330\u00b0\n|The [[water carrier|Water-bearer]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]\n|[[Image:Pisces.svg|20px]]\n|11\n|330\u00b0 to 360\u00b0\n|The [[Fishes]]\n|}\n\n=== Polarity and the four elements ===\n{{main|Triplicity}}\n{{Further|Classical element}}\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n\n[[Image:Sign position example.svg|220px|thumb|right|A simple diagram displaying the planets' sign positions on May 16th, 2012.

He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles called love and strife manipulating the four elements, and stated that these four elements were all equal, of the same age, that each rules its own province, and each possesses its own individual character.

By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. The most important of these categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall.\n\n* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''': A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered \"strong\" (well-dignified). Seventeenth century astrologer [[William Lilly]] compared rulership to a king on his throne, with considerable dignity. If a planet is in the sign opposite that which it rules (or is dignified), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).<ref name=\"glossary\">\"Glossary of Astrological Terms\". Logos, Asaa 1998\u20132004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation (see below), [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability to give of one's true nature. Contemporary traditional astrologers like [[John Frawley (astrologer)|John Frawley]] or [[J Lee Lehman]] explain further on the concept of Essential Dignity.<ref name=\"glossary\" />\n\n* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''': In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest \u2013 who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment. The Planet in fall is passively rejected or ignored by the sign that it's in. It can be likened to a mayor of a rival city trying to make suggestions to the hosting mayor for how he should run his city: The host mayor finds it difficult to trust him and cannot see how his input could have relevancy to his city. The people of the city feel the same as their ruler. The result is impasse and failure on behalf of both mayors and the city.<ref name=\"glossary\" /> There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.<ref>Hone (1978), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998\u20132007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}</ref> The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of ''Accidental Debilities'', such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.\n\n=== Additional classifications ===\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n{{Details|Decans}}\nEach sign can be divided into three 10\u00b0 sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;87</ref> The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity.

The tropical zodiac is the zodiac of seasonal factors as opposed to the sidereal zodiac (constellation factors). The primary seasonal factors are based on the changing ratio of sunlight and darkness across the year. The first factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when daylight is increasing, or the half of the year when darkness is increasing. The second factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when there is more daylight than darkness, or the half when there is more darkness than daylight. The third factor is which of the four seasons the chosen time falls in, defined by the first two factors.

The order of the astrological signs is [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. Each sector was named for a constellation it was passing through in times of naming.\n\nThe concept of the [[zodiac]] originated in [[Babylonian astrology]], and was later influenced by [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] culture.

Western astrology measures from [[Equinox]] and [[Solstice]] points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the [[tropical year]]), while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] or [[Vedic astrology]] measures along the equatorial plane ([[sidereal year]]). [[Precession]] results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the [[constellations]] that carry similar names,<ref>Bobrick (2005), pp. 10, 23.</ref> while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] measurements still correspond with the background constellations.<ref>Johnsen (2004).</ref>\n\n== Western zodiac signs ==\n=== Zodiac history and symbolism ===\n{{main|Zodiac}}\n{{further|Babylonian astrology|Hellenistic astrology|Ancient Egyptian astronomy}}\n[[Image:Sign cusps.png|250px|thumb|right|The twelve ecliptic signs.

In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]\n\nWhile Western astrology is essentially a product of Greco-Roman culture,{{Citation needed|reason=unclear as to why this is the case|date=June 2019}} some of its more basic concepts originated in Babylon. Isolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac.<ref>Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.</ref> Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.<ref>Sachs (1948), p. 289.</ref>\n\nBy the 4th century BC, [[Babylonia]]n astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astrology of [[ancient Egypt]] by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[Horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', a work that was responsible for astrology's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East, and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.\n\nThe following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss), which express the [[constellation]] they are named for. The longitude [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|intervals]], are treated as closed for the first endpoint (''a'') and open for the second (''b'') \u2013 for instance, 30\u00b0 of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. The sign numbers, 0 through 11, are seen instead of the symbols in some astronomical works.\n\nAny association of calendar dates with these signs only makes sense when referring to [[Sun sign astrology]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Sign\n! scope=\"col\" | Symbol\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Ecliptic longitude<br>(''a'' \u2264 {{math|''&lambda;''}} < ''b'')\n! scope=\"col\" | Gloss\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]\n|[[Image:Aries.svg|20px]]\n|0\n|0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0\n|The [[Sheep|Ram]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]\n|[[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]]\n|1\n|30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0\n|The [[Bull]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]\n|[[Image:Gemini.svg|20px]]\n|2\n|60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\n|The [[Twin]]s\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]\n|[[Image:Cancer.svg|20px]]\n|3\n|90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0\n|The [[Crab]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]\n|[[Image:Leo.svg|20px]]\n|4\n|120\u00b0 to 150\u00b0\n|The [[Lion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]\n|[[Image:Virgo.svg|20px]]\n|5\n|150\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n|The [[Maiden]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]\n|[[Image:Libra.svg|24px]]\n|6\n|180\u00b0 to 210\u00b0\n|The [[Weighing scale|Scales]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]\n|[[Image:Scorpio.svg|20px]]\n|7\n|210\u00b0 to 240\u00b0\n|The [[Scorpion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]\n|[[Image:Sagittarius.svg|20px]]\n|8\n|240\u00b0 to 270\u00b0\n|The [[Archery|Archer]] ([[Centaur]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]\n|[[Image:Capricorn.svg|26px]]\n|9\n|270\u00b0 to 300\u00b0\n|The [[Goat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]\n|[[Image:Aquarius.svg|24px]]\n|10\n|300\u00b0 to 330\u00b0\n|The [[water carrier|Water-bearer]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]\n|[[Image:Pisces.svg|20px]]\n|11\n|330\u00b0 to 360\u00b0\n|The [[Fishes]]\n|}\n\n=== Polarity and the four elements ===\n{{main|Triplicity}}\n{{Further|Classical element}}\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n\n[[Image:Sign position example.svg|220px|thumb|right|A simple diagram displaying the planets' sign positions on May 16th, 2012.

He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles called love and strife manipulating the four elements, and stated that these four elements were all equal, of the same age, that each rules its own province, and each possesses its own individual character. Different mixtures of these elements produced the different natures of things. Empedocles said that those who were born with near equal proportions of the four elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.<ref name=\"Charlie Higgins\">{{cite web|url=http://accessnewage.com/Articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |title=Astrology and The Four Elements |author=Charlie Higgins |year=1997 |accessdate=2009-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103102752/http://accessnewage.com/articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach sign is associated with one of the [[classical element]]s (fire, air, earth, and water),<ref name=\"RobLeo\">Pelletier, Robert, and Leonard Cataldo (1984).

By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. The most important of these categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall.\n\n* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''': A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered \"strong\" (well-dignified). Seventeenth century astrologer [[William Lilly]] compared rulership to a king on his throne, with considerable dignity. If a planet is in the sign opposite that which it rules (or is dignified), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).<ref name=\"glossary\">\"Glossary of Astrological Terms\". Logos, Asaa 1998\u20132004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation (see below), [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability to give of one's true nature. Contemporary traditional astrologers like [[John Frawley (astrologer)|John Frawley]] or [[J Lee Lehman]] explain further on the concept of Essential Dignity.<ref name=\"glossary\" />\n\n* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''': In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest \u2013 who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment. The Planet in fall is passively rejected or ignored by the sign that it's in. It can be likened to a mayor of a rival city trying to make suggestions to the hosting mayor for how he should run his city: The host mayor finds it difficult to trust him and cannot see how his input could have relevancy to his city. The people of the city feel the same as their ruler. The result is impasse and failure on behalf of both mayors and the city.<ref name=\"glossary\" /> There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.<ref>Hone (1978), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Fall\n|-\n| '''Sun''' ([[File:Sun symbol.svg|15px|Sol]]) || Leo || Cancer || Aries || Libra\n|-\n| '''Moon''' ([[File:Moon symbol crescent.svg|15px|First quarter moon]]) || Cancer || Leo || Taurus || Scorpio\n|-\n| '''Mercury''' ([[File:Mercury symbol.svg|15px|Mercury]]) || Gemini || Sagittarius and Pisces || Aquarius || Leo\n|-\n| '''Venus''' ([[File:Venus symbol.svg|15px|Venus]]) || Libra and Taurus || Aries and Scorpio || Pisces || Virgo\n|-\n| '''Mars''' ([[File:Mars symbol.svg|15px|Mars]]) || Aries and Scorpio || Libra and Taurus || Capricorn || Cancer\n|-\n| '''Jupiter''' ([[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|15px|Jupiter]]) || Sagittarius and Pisces || Gemini and Virgo || Cancer || Capricorn\n|-\n| '''Saturn''' ([[File:Saturn symbol.svg|15px|Saturn]]) || Capricorn and Aquarius || Cancer and Leo || Libra || Aries\n|-\n!Earth \n|Virgo\n|Scorpio\n|Leo\n|Cancer\n|}\n\nIn addition to essential dignity, the traditional astrologer considers ''[[Accidental dignity]]'' of planets. This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998\u20132007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}</ref> The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of ''Accidental Debilities'', such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.\n\n=== Additional classifications ===\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n{{Details|Decans}}\nEach sign can be divided into three 10\u00b0 sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse.

The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs.
