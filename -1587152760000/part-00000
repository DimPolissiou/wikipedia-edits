The parents of the children exchange stories and the Fitpatricks tell the Ellerbys that they are naming their son Leonard Fitzpatrick, after his great-grandfather. The Ellerbys exclaim that they are naming their daughter after her great-grandmother, Amanda Ellerby. Angelina predicts that the two children will be best friends and makes them promise they will celebrate this day together every year. A year later, on Amanda and Leo's first birthday, the Ellerbys and Fitpatricks are surprised to find themselves together again. It turns out that both families have been booked into the same birthday room at the Magic Castle Birthday Party Palace by mistake. They spend Amanda and Leo's birthday together, watching the two bond and even take their first steps together. The two children become friends.OMGGG!!\n\n\nThe night before Amanda and Leo's 11th birthday, Amanda is busy practicing back handsprings with her friend Stephanie for the next day's gymnastics tryouts at school. The girls want to get on the team in order to become friends with the popular girls. Amanda's mother arrives home from work, and Amanda notices that her mother has sent Leo an invitation to her party and gets upset. She is still angry because she overheard Leo tell his friends that he thought it was stupid that he had to spend his birthday with a girl, but she doesn\u2019t have many other friends so he wouldn\u2019t want to tell her and hurt her feelings. After that Amanda refused to speak to Leo, locking away all of their pictures and even throwing the flowerpot that she had hand painted with Leo on their 5th birthday, along with the plant in it, out her window.\n\nThe day of Amanda and Leo's birthday does not go well for Amanda. She has to take the bus to school and forgets her lunch, and there is a pop quiz in class. She fails the gymnastics tryouts although Stephanie makes the team. When it comes time for her birthday party, most of her friends end up ditching in favor of Leo's. The night ends with her finding out that her mother has been fired from her job because she had mistakenly switched an important work presentation with her sister's science presentation. Amanda she goes to bed tired and disappointed. \n\nWhen Amanda wakes up the next morning it seems as if the whole day is playing out exactly like the day before. At first she believes everybody is playing a cruel joke but finally it dawns on her that it is the day of her birthday all over again. She does everything exactly the same as before, afraid to change any details. It's only when she's getting ready for her party she realizes that she is stuck in a time loop.\n\nThe following morning is exactly the same as the previous two days but this time Amanda decides to fake sick and stay home. Her neighbor takes her to the doctor where she lets slip something about an old family feud between the Ellerbys and the Fitzpatricks but she doesn\u2019t know much about it, so Amanda doesn\u2019t pursue it. Her party ends up being cancelled and she spends the night with her family. In the morning, Amanda realizes that she's still stuck on the same day. Frustrated and confused she goes to school but this time, while she's sitting in class, she sees Leo wink at her, which makes her realize the two of them are stuck in this time loop together.\n\nAmanda is relieved the next morning when nobody remembers that they are angry with her and she is no longer grounded. She even remembers to remind her mom about taking the right presentation. At school, Amanda and Leo finally get the chance to talk. He apologizes to her for the things he said and tells her he only said them because he wanted to look cool in front of his friends. They both agree that they miss each other and become friends again and decide tomorrow they are going to skip school and go out since there will be no consequences the next day.\n\nThe next morning Amanda fakes sick and stays home. When her dad falls asleep, she sneaks out to meet up with Leo. Leo has the whole day planned and it starts with them going for breakfast where Leo orders lots of food he would never normally get to eat. He then leads her to an open mic poetry reading where he gets up in front of the crowd and reads some of his own poetry. Leo then proceeds to take Amanda to an audition for a band looking for a drummer. After much coaxing Amanda agrees to try out. The band members are impressed, but they tell her to come back when she is older. Exhilarated, the two finally head to the mall where security grabs them and turns them over to their families who are worried sick about them.\n\nThe day goes as it normally does but after school Amanda and Leo go visit the Senior Community Center and ask around about the family feud that Amanda's neighbor had previously mentioned. They find out that their grandfathers used to own competing apple groves and they would always do things to try and harm the others\u2019 farm. Then, however, they suddenly made up for unknown reasons. Amanda and Leo still need more answers so they decide to go to the Willow Falls Historical Society the next day.\n\nThey go to the Willow Falls Historical Society where they find Angelina. She tells them that the town had sought the help of someone special who told the two men that they had to patch up their differences by the Harvest Day or else there would be consequences. Angelina claims she doesn\u2019t know anymore and the only thing that would have more information would be a journal that was stolen a while ago. Amanda and Leo ultimately come back the next day to sneak into the historical society and look around for the journal because they think she actually stashed the journal somewhere in the place. They end up finding Leo's great-grandfather's journal instead which revealed that because they didn\u2019t heed the woman's warning and patch things up within the year they went through a time loop as well until they resolved their differences and fixed all the damage they caused. Amanda and Leo are confused because they made up a week ago but they are still stuck. They decide to help everyone that they possibly can tomorrow in hopes that it will fix things. The next day, Amanda and Leo help everybody that they possibly can, such as reminding her mother about the presentation mix up, even though her mother still gets fired, suggesting that some things are meant to be. Amanda manages to make the gymnastics team. During their birthday parties they decide to merge them and both Leo and Amanda have high hopes they have broken the time loop.\n\nIn the morning, Amanda realizes that she is celebrating her birthday again for the 11th time. She is frustrated but when she gets on the bus she sees the Angelina is the bus driver and ultimately she gives her and Leo some answers. She reveals that she was the one who put the spell their great-grandfathers and was worried that it would transfer over to them. She insists that this shouldn\u2019t have happened though because on their 5th birthday she gave them plants protecting them from the curse. As long as they had the plants close they shouldn\u2019t have fallen into the time loop. Leo claims that's his is still sitting in his room but Amanda admits that she threw hers out the window a year ago on the night of their tenth birthday. Angelina makes them hurry back to class where everything goes as normal, except this time Amanda tries out for the marching band instead of the gymnastics team, something she secretly had wanted to do the whole time. When Amanda gets home from school she is relieved to find the plant still in the bushes under her window and she returns it back to its place in her bedroom. Both Amanda and Leo decide that they are just going to have one big party together this time where they spend the night laughing together just like old times. To both Amanda and Leo's relief, the next morning is finally the day after their birthday. Amanda and Leo make a pact that they will always stay in touch with each other so that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\n== Reception and awards ==\n''11 Birthdays'', was positively received by both the general public and critics. [[The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books]] published a review by Jeannette Hulick, which states that ''11 Birthdays'' \u201cis imaginatively developed and kid-pleasing. The now-tenuous/now-tenacious quality of the book\u2019s middle-grade friendships will ring true to its audience, and Amanda\u2019s voice is likable and humorous.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hulick|first=Jeannette|date=2009|title=11 Birthdays (review)|journal=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|language=en|volume=62|issue=6|pages=247\u2013248|doi=10.1353/bcc.0.0666|issn=1558-6766}}</ref> [[Publishers Weekly]] also states, \u201cLike a [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] for middle grade readers, Mass' winning story features a girl seemingly trapped in her 11th birthday. Amanda seems doomed to relive her failed try-out for the gymnastics team, her mother being fired from her job and, worst of all, the party that even her best friend leaves early\u2014to go to the party hosted by her former friend, Leo. The two have celebrated every previous birthday together (they were born on the same day), but a misunderstanding on their 10th has gone unresolved. Girls will relate to Amanda\u2019s insecurities, and the confidence and insights she gains will resonate with them. Mass\u2019s expertise with pacing keeps the story moving at a lively clip, and her understanding of this age group is as finely honed as ever.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wendymass.com/books/11-birthdays/reviews/|title=Reviews - Wendy Mass|work=Wendy Mass|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}</ref> ''11 Birthdays'' has been nominated for and received numerous awards, including the [[William Allen White Children's Book Award|William Allen White Award]] for grades 3-5 in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emporia.edu/libsv/wawbookaward/winners/pastwinners.html|title=Past Winners - William Allen White Children's Book Awards {{!}} Emporia State University|website=www.emporia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> and has been chosen a 2009 Library Guild Selection.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==''Willow Falls''==\nThe five novels of the ''Willow Falls'' series all have different protagonists, who become friends.

She has to take the bus to school and forgets her lunch, and there is a pop quiz in class. She fails the gymnastics tryouts although Stephanie makes the team. When it comes time for her birthday party, most of her friends end up ditching in favor of Leo's. The night ends with her finding out that her mother has been fired from her job because she had mistakenly switched an important work presentation with her sister's science presentation. Amanda she goes to bed tired and disappointed. \n\nWhen Amanda wakes up the next morning it seems as if the whole day is playing out exactly like the day before. At first she believes everybody is playing a cruel joke but finally it dawns on her that it is the day of her birthday all over again. She does everything exactly the same as before, afraid to change any details. It's only when she's getting ready for her party she realizes that she is stuck in a time loop.\n\nThe following morning is exactly the same as the previous two days but this time Amanda decides to fake sick and stay home. Her neighbor takes her to the doctor where she lets slip something about an old family feud between the Ellerbys and the Fitzpatricks but she doesn\u2019t know much about it, so Amanda doesn\u2019t pursue it. Her party ends up being cancelled and she spends the night with her family. In the morning, Amanda realizes that she's still stuck on the same day. Frustrated and confused she goes to school but this time, while she's sitting in class, she sees Leo wink at her, which makes her realize the two of them are stuck in this time loop together.\n\nAmanda is relieved the next morning when nobody remembers that they are angry with her and she is no longer grounded. She even remembers to remind her mom about taking the right presentation. At school, Amanda and Leo finally get the chance to talk. He apologizes to her for the things he said and tells her he only said them because he wanted to look cool in front of his friends. They both agree that they miss each other and become friends again and decide tomorrow they are going to skip school and go out since there will be no consequences the next day.\n\nThe next morning Amanda fakes sick and stays home. When her dad falls asleep, she sneaks out to meet up with Leo. Leo has the whole day planned and it starts with them going for breakfast where Leo orders lots of food he would never normally get to eat. He then leads her to an open mic poetry reading where he gets up in front of the crowd and reads some of his own poetry. Leo then proceeds to take Amanda to an audition for a band looking for a drummer. After much coaxing Amanda agrees to try out. The band members are impressed, but they tell her to come back when she is older. Exhilarated, the two finally head to the mall where security grabs them and turns them over to their families who are worried sick about them.\n\nThe day goes as it normally does but after school Amanda and Leo go visit the Senior Community Center and ask around about the family feud that Amanda's neighbor had previously mentioned. They find out that their grandfathers used to own competing apple groves and they would always do things to try and harm the others\u2019 farm. Then, however, they suddenly made up for unknown reasons. Amanda and Leo still need more answers so they decide to go to the Willow Falls Historical Society the next day.\n\nThey go to the Willow Falls Historical Society where they find Angelina. She tells them that the town had sought the help of someone special who told the two men that they had to patch up their differences by the Harvest Day or else there would be consequences. Angelina claims she doesn\u2019t know anymore and the only thing that would have more information would be a journal that was stolen a while ago. Amanda and Leo ultimately come back the next day to sneak into the historical society and look around for the journal because they think she actually stashed the journal somewhere in the place. They end up finding Leo's great-grandfather's journal instead which revealed that because they didn\u2019t heed the woman's warning and patch things up within the year they went through a time loop as well until they resolved their differences and fixed all the damage they caused. Amanda and Leo are confused because they made up a week ago but they are still stuck. They decide to help everyone that they possibly can tomorrow in hopes that it will fix things. The next day, Amanda and Leo help everybody that they possibly can, such as reminding her mother about the presentation mix up, even though her mother still gets fired, suggesting that some things are meant to be. Amanda manages to make the gymnastics team. During their birthday parties they decide to merge them and both Leo and Amanda have high hopes they have broken the time loop.\n\nIn the morning, Amanda realizes that she is celebrating her birthday again for the 11th time. She is frustrated but when she gets on the bus she sees the Angelina is the bus driver and ultimately she gives her and Leo some answers. She reveals that she was the one who put the spell their great-grandfathers and was worried that it would transfer over to them. She insists that this shouldn\u2019t have happened though because on their 5th birthday she gave them plants protecting them from the curse. As long as they had the plants close they shouldn\u2019t have fallen into the time loop. Leo claims that's his is still sitting in his room but Amanda admits that she threw hers out the window a year ago on the night of their tenth birthday. Angelina makes them hurry back to class where everything goes as normal, except this time Amanda tries out for the marching band instead of the gymnastics team, something she secretly had wanted to do the whole time. When Amanda gets home from school she is relieved to find the plant still in the bushes under her window and she returns it back to its place in her bedroom. Both Amanda and Leo decide that they are just going to have one big party together this time where they spend the night laughing together just like old times. To both Amanda and Leo's relief, the next morning is finally the day after their birthday. Amanda and Leo make a pact that they will always stay in touch with each other so that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\n== Reception and awards ==\n''11 Birthdays'', was positively received by both the general public and critics. [[The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books]] published a review by Jeannette Hulick, which states that ''11 Birthdays'' \u201cis imaginatively developed and kid-pleasing. The now-tenuous/now-tenacious quality of the book\u2019s middle-grade friendships will ring true to its audience, and Amanda\u2019s voice is likable and humorous.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hulick|first=Jeannette|date=2009|title=11 Birthdays (review)|journal=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|language=en|volume=62|issue=6|pages=247\u2013248|doi=10.1353/bcc.0.0666|issn=1558-6766}}</ref> [[Publishers Weekly]] also states, \u201cLike a [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] for middle grade readers, Mass' winning story features a girl seemingly trapped in her 11th birthday. Amanda seems doomed to relive her failed try-out for the gymnastics team, her mother being fired from her job and, worst of all, the party that even her best friend leaves early\u2014to go to the party hosted by her former friend, Leo. The two have celebrated every previous birthday together (they were born on the same day), but a misunderstanding on their 10th has gone unresolved. Girls will relate to Amanda\u2019s insecurities, and the confidence and insights she gains will resonate with them. Mass\u2019s expertise with pacing keeps the story moving at a lively clip, and her understanding of this age group is as finely honed as ever.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wendymass.com/books/11-birthdays/reviews/|title=Reviews - Wendy Mass|work=Wendy Mass|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}</ref> ''11 Birthdays'' has been nominated for and received numerous awards, including the [[William Allen White Children's Book Award|William Allen White Award]] for grades 3-5 in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emporia.edu/libsv/wawbookaward/winners/pastwinners.html|title=Past Winners - William Allen White Children's Book Awards {{!}} Emporia State University|website=www.emporia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> and has been chosen a 2009 Library Guild Selection.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==''Willow Falls''==\nThe five novels of the ''Willow Falls'' series all have different protagonists, who become friends.

R. (2006). ''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights. Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by a half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]). Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. Lanthanum was thus trivalent, cerium tetravalent, and didymium pentavalent; however, neither the higher valency for cerium nor for didymium had been established, and Mendeleev tried to do that himself. Having had no success in that, he abandoned his attempts to incorporate the rare earth metals in late 1871 and embarked on his grand idea of [[luminiferous ether]].

These radioactive elements (termed \"radioelements\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied. Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights. Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by a half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]). Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. Lanthanum was thus trivalent, cerium tetravalent, and didymium pentavalent; however, neither the higher valency for cerium nor for didymium had been established, and Mendeleev tried to do that himself. Having had no success in that, he abandoned his attempts to incorporate the rare earth metals in late 1871 and embarked on his grand idea of [[luminiferous ether]].

However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the [[octet rule]].<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the [[valence bond theory]], published in 1916 by American chemist [[Gilbert N.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law.

More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s.

He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip,<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp. 56, 59</ref> and within a year was promoted to operator.

Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed him as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|4.00|1853|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).

Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country.<ref>Edge (2004) p. 37</ref> As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year (${{Inflation|US|1500|1859|r=-3|fmt=c}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\"/> His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.<ref name=\"Nasaw\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 54\u201359, 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nScott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties \"as part of a [[quid pro quo]]\".<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 59\u201360.</ref> In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing of a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\"/><ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 79</ref> A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.\n\n===1860\u20131865: The Civil War===\nBefore the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]], which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}. The investment proved a success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Carnegie, Andrew|volume=5|pages=364\u201365}}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was \"the first casualty of the war\" when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.\n\nDefeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.\n\n===Keystone Bridge Company===\nIn 1864, Carnegie was one of the early investors in the Columbia Oil Company in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Story Farm, Columbia Farm, Columbia Oil Company\n*{{cite web |url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/phi/v10_2009/randolph.htm |title=Columbia Oil Farm of the Oil Creek Valley, Venago County, PA : 150 Years of Petroleum Legacy |date=2001 |publisher=Petroleum History Institute}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Columbia/Columbia.html |title=Andrew Carnegie and the Columbia Oil Farm |work=Oil History |publisher=petroleumhistory.org}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Columbia/Story.html |title=William Story Farm |date=2001 |publisher=Petroleum History Institute}}</ref> In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.\n\nAfter the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several ironworks, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions, which Carnegie exploited to his advantage.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 105\u2013107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie circa 1878 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, c. 1878]]\nCarnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote:\n{{quote|I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes! Let us cast aside business forever, except for others. Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men. I figure that this will take three years' active work. I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public. We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of [[idolatry]]! No idol is more debasing than the worship of money! Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery.

One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the [[Bessemer process]], which allowed the high carbon content of [[pig iron]] to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during [[steel production]]. Steel prices dropped as a result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last=Rosenberg |first=Nathan |year=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/90 90] |url=https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/90 }} Bessemer steel suffered from nitrogen embrittlement with age</ref>\n\nThe second was in his [[vertical integration]] of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig iron|pig metal]] per day. In 1883, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway, and a line of [[Great Lakes freighter|lake steamships]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Carnegie |title=Andrew Carnegie {{!}} Biography & Facts |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-08-23 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.\n\n====1901: U.S. Steel====\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie, Vanity Fair, 1903-10-29.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Carnegie caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1903]]\nIn 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[Joint-stock company|joint stock corporation]]s as preparation for this. [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.\n\nThe buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.<ref name=\"Hawke 1980\"/>\n\nCarnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion \u2013 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Krass |first1=Peter |title=Carnegie |date=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0471386308 |page=Chapter 29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwJ-UFP20mMC&pg=PT416&lpg=PT416&dq=carnegie+vault+for+us+steel+bonds&source=bl&ots=GqHK7rwNbo&sig=ACfU3U0BRm787CPhPNUnsx3xTwN0dX7KgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlob-8jZrmAhUjZN8KHVsWBvgQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=carnegie%20vault%20for%20us%20steel%20bonds&f=false |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Scholar and activist===\n====1880\u20131900====\nCarnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended the English poet [[Matthew Arnold]], the English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], and the American humorist [[Mark Twain]], as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]],{{sfnp |Winkler |2006 |p=172}} statesmen, and notable writers.{{sfnp |Winkler |2006 |p=13}}\n\nCarnegie constructed commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in [[Dunfermline]] in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave \u00a38,000 for the establishment of a [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[NYU Langone Medical Center|New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the Carnegie Laboratory.\n\nIn 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a [[Carnegie library]] which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with [[Samuel Storey]], he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of \"the British Republic\". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around [[Lake Superior]]. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain''.\n\n[[File:James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce & Andrew Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, right, with [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in 1886]]\nAlthough actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]''. Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.\n\nIn 1889, Carnegie published \"Wealth\" in the June issue of the ''North American Review''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html |journal=North American Review |title=Wealth |author=Carnegie, Andrew |date=June 1889 }}</ref> After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile.\n\nCarnegie was a well-regarded writer. He published three books on travel.<ref>Swetnam, George (1980) ''Andrew Carnegie''. Twayne Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\nWhile Carnegie did not comment on British imperialism, he strongly opposed the idea of American colonies. He opposed the annexation of the Philippines almost to the point of supporting [[William Jennings Bryan]] against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/timeline/timeline2.html Andrew Carnegie timeline of events] PBS.</ref> However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]], in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] and literary figures like [[Mark Twain]].<ref>Hirschfeld, Katherine ''Health, Politics and Revolution in Cuba'', p. 117, Transaction Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0863-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Porter, Robert Percival |title=Industrial Cuba: Being a Study of Present Commercial and Industrial Conditions, with Suggestions as to the Opportunities Presented in the Island for American Capital, Enterprise, and Labour|url=https://archive.org/details/industrialcubab00portgoog|year=1899|publisher=G.P.

From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects.

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881. Prior to the flood, speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Less than {{convert|20|mi}} downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown.\n\nThe dam was {{convert|72|ft|m}} high and {{convert|931|ft|m}} long. Between 1881 when the club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the 3 [[cast iron]] discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown. Such repair work, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889, resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley as the Johnstown Flood.<ref>McCullough, David (1987) ''The Johnstown Flood''. Simon & Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0671207148}}</ref> When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members.\n\nAlthough Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year. After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood. The Carnegie-donated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and houses the Flood Museum.\n\n===1892: Homestead Strike===\n[[File:Homestead Strike - Mob attacking Pinkerton men.jpg|thumb|The Homestead Strike]]\n\nThe [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U.S. history. The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], and grew out of a labor dispute between the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA) and the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].\n\nCarnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked.<ref name=\"Carnegie, Andrew 1920\">''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch. 17.</ref> In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]]. Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sentiment. With the collective bargaining agreement between the union and company expiring at the end of June, Frick and the leaders of the local AA union entered into negotiations in February. With the steel industry doing well and prices higher, the AA asked for a wage increase; the AA represented about 800 of the 3,800 workers at the plant. Frick immediately countered with an average 22% wage decrease that would affect nearly half the union's membership and remove a number of positions from the bargaining unit.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_Labor_Movement_in_the_Uni.html?id=NZY8mAT222EC |title=History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume Two: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism |last=Foner |first=Philip Sheldon |date=1975 |publisher=International Pub |isbn=9780717803880 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead]]\nThe union and company failed to come to an agreement, and management locked the union out. Workers considered the stoppage a \"[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]\" by management and not a \"strike\" by workers. As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing [[Labor history of the United States|labor rights movement]], strongly opposed by management. Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them.\n\nOn July 6, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men \u2014 seven strikers and three Pinkertons \u2014 were killed and hundreds were injured. Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert E. Pattison|Robert Pattison]] ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site. Then allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding him.

Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of \"commercial murder\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system. Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies. Over the course of twenty years, Carnegie's steel properties grew to include the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, the Lucy Furnace Works, the Union Iron Mills, the Homestead Works, the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines among many other industry related assets.<ref>Morris, Charles R.

In his 1854 essay \"Manners and Fashion\", Spencer referred to public education as \"Old schemes\". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, \"political, religious, literary, philanthropic\", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its \"original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism\".<ref>Spencer, Herbert. 1854 (''Manners and Fashion'') ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 74639\u201374656).

Carnegie believed that the sons of prosperous businesspersons were rarely as talented as their fathers.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> By leaving large sums of money to their children, wealthy business leaders were wasting resources that could be used to benefit society. Most notably, Carnegie believed that the future leaders of society would rise from the ranks of the poor.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 682\u2013689.</ref> Carnegie strongly believed in this because he had risen from the bottom.

In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of [[Calvinism]], and religion as a whole, but reconciled with it later in his life. In his autobiography, Carnegie describes his family as moderate [[Presbyterian]] believers, writing that \"there was not one orthodox Presbyterian\" in his family; various members of his family having somewhat distanced themselves from Calvinism, some of them leaning more towards [[Swedenborgianism]]. Although, being a child, his family led vigorous theological and political disputes. His mother avoided the topic of religion. His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation, while, according to Carnegie, still remaining very religious on his own.\n\nWitnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]]</ref> Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, \"Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.\"<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 339</ref>\n\nLater in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member of [[Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church]], pastored from 1905 to 1926 by [[Social Gospel]] exponent [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], while his wife and daughter belonged to the [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/04/23/archives/bagpipe-tunes-at-carnegie-wedding-charm-of-bonnie-scotland-lent-to.html \"Bagpipe Tunes at Carnegie Wedding\"].

These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.<ref>Carnegie, ''An American Four-in-Hand in Britain'' (New York, 1883), pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nDespite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for the newly-established [[International Court of Arbitration]]'s [[Peace Palace]] \u2013 brainchild of Russian Tsar [[Nicolas II]].<ref name=\"MoscowTimes\">{{cite web |last1=Gay |first1=Mark H |title=The Hague Peace Palace Keeps Tsar's Vision Alive |url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html |website=The Moscow Times |accessdate=August 8, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808232924/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html |archivedate=August 8, 2016 |date=November 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.<ref>David S.

Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.\n\nDespite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.\n\n===US colonial expansion===\nOn the matter of [[American imperialism|American colonial expansion]], Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the [[Newlands Resolution|annexation of the Hawaiian islands]] or [[Puerto Rico]], but he opposed the [[Philippine\u2013American War|annexation of the Philippines]]. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence.<ref>Carnegie, ''Americanism Versus Imperialism'', esp. pp. 12\u201313</ref> This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.\n\nAfter he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British writer [[William T. Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:\n\n{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision. I wonder that you do not see this. There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaire's money. Its life is tainted thereby.<ref>Quoted in Hendrick, B. J. (1932) ''The Life of Andrew Carnegie'', Vol.2, p. 337. Garden City, NY [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA376]</ref>}}\n\nCarnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.\n\nLike Stead, he believed that the United States and the [[British Empire]] would merge into one nation, telling him \"We are heading straight to the Re-United States\". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/406/mode/2up |title=The Americanization of the World |publisher=Horace Markley |author=Stead, W.T. |year=1901 |pages=406\u201312}}</ref> The creation of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the \"scientific\" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patterson, David S. |title=Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=114 |issue=5 |year=1970 |pages=371\u201383 |jstor=985802}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nCarnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labor issues.

Of this sum, $62,000,000 was allotted to the British Empire and $288,000,000 to the United States, for Carnegie, in the main, confined his benefactions to the English-speaking nations. His largest gifts were $125,000,000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (this same body also became his residuary legatee),  $60,000,000 to public library buildings, $20,000,000 to colleges (usually the smaller ones), $6,000,000 to church organs, $29,000,000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, $10,000,000 to Hero Funds, $10,000,000 to the Endowment for International Peace, $10,000,000 to the Scottish Universities Trust, $10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Trust, and $3,750,000 to the Dunfermline Trust.<ref>Burton J. Hendrick, \"Carnegie, Andrew, 1835\u20131919\" ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1929) v. 3 p. 505.</ref>\n\nHendrick argues that:\n:These gifts fairly picture Carnegie's conception of the best ways to improve the status of the common man. They represent all his personal tastes \u2013 his love of books, art, music, and nature \u2013 and the reforms which he regarded as most essential to human progress \u2013 scientific research, education both literary and technical, and, above all, the abolition of war. The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegie's name is that for public libraries. Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fund \u2013 among other reasons, because \"it came up my ain back\"; but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance. There was only one genuine remedy, he believed, for the ills that beset the human race, and that was enlightenment. \"Let there be light\" was the motto that, in the early days, he insisted on placing in all his library buildings. As to the greatest endowment of all, the Carnegie Corporation, that was merely Andrew Carnegie in permanently organized form; it was established to carry on, after Carnegie's death, the work to which he had given personal attention in his own lifetime.<ref>Hendrick, \"Carnegie, Andrew, 1835\u20131919\"</ref>\n\n===Research sources===\nCarnegie's personal papers are at the [[Library of Congress]] Manuscript Division.\nThe Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie: The [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] (CCNY); The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] (CEIP); the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] (CFAT);The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs (CCEIA).

Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed him as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|4.00|1853|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).

The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.<ref name=\"Nasaw\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 54\u201359, 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nScott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties \"as part of a [[quid pro quo]]\".<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 59\u201360.</ref> In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing of a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\"/><ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 79</ref> A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.\n\n===1860\u20131865: The Civil War===\nBefore the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]], which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}. The investment proved a success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Carnegie, Andrew|volume=5|pages=364\u201365}}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was \"the first casualty of the war\" when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.\n\nDefeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.\n\n===Keystone Bridge Company===\nIn 1864, Carnegie was one of the early investors in the Columbia Oil Company in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Story Farm, Columbia Farm, Columbia Oil Company\n*{{cite web |url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/phi/v10_2009/randolph.htm |title=Columbia Oil Farm of the Oil Creek Valley, Venago County, PA : 150 Years of Petroleum Legacy |date=2001 |publisher=Petroleum History Institute}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Columbia/Columbia.html |title=Andrew Carnegie and the Columbia Oil Farm |work=Oil History |publisher=petroleumhistory.org}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Columbia/Story.html |title=William Story Farm |date=2001 |publisher=Petroleum History Institute}}</ref> In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.\n\nAfter the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several ironworks, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions, which Carnegie exploited to his advantage.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 105\u2013107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie circa 1878 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, c. 1878]]\nCarnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote:\n{{quote|I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes! Let us cast aside business forever, except for others. Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men. I figure that this will take three years' active work. I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public. We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of [[idolatry]]! No idol is more debasing than the worship of money! Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery.

One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the [[Bessemer process]], which allowed the high carbon content of [[pig iron]] to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during [[steel production]]. Steel prices dropped as a result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last=Rosenberg |first=Nathan |year=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/90 90] |url=https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/90 }} Bessemer steel suffered from nitrogen embrittlement with age</ref>\n\nThe second was in his [[vertical integration]] of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig iron|pig metal]] per day. In 1883, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway, and a line of [[Great Lakes freighter|lake steamships]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Carnegie |title=Andrew Carnegie {{!}} Biography & Facts |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-08-23 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.\n\n====1901: U.S. Steel====\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie, Vanity Fair, 1903-10-29.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Carnegie caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1903]]\nIn 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[Joint-stock company|joint stock corporation]]s as preparation for this. [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profits. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.\n\nThe buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.<ref name=\"Hawke 1980\"/>\n\nCarnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion \u2013 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Krass |first1=Peter |title=Carnegie |date=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0471386308 |page=Chapter 29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwJ-UFP20mMC&pg=PT416&lpg=PT416&dq=carnegie+vault+for+us+steel+bonds&source=bl&ots=GqHK7rwNbo&sig=ACfU3U0BRm787CPhPNUnsx3xTwN0dX7KgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlob-8jZrmAhUjZN8KHVsWBvgQ6AEwCXoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=carnegie%20vault%20for%20us%20steel%20bonds&f=false |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Scholar and activist===\n====1880\u20131900====\nCarnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended the English poet [[Matthew Arnold]], the English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], and the American humorist [[Mark Twain]], as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]],{{sfnp |Winkler |2006 |p=172}} statesmen, and notable writers.{{sfnp |Winkler |2006 |p=13}}\n\nCarnegie constructed commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in [[Dunfermline]] in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave \u00a38,000 for the establishment of a [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[NYU Langone Medical Center|New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the Carnegie Laboratory.\n\nIn 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a [[Carnegie library]] which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with [[Samuel Storey]], he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of \"the British Republic\". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around [[Lake Superior]]. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain''.\n\n[[File:James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce & Andrew Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, right, with [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in 1886]]\nAlthough actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]''. Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.\n\nIn 1889, Carnegie published \"Wealth\" in the June issue of the ''North American Review''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html |journal=North American Review |title=Wealth |author=Carnegie, Andrew |date=June 1889 }}</ref> After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile.\n\nCarnegie was a well-regarded writer. He published three books on travel.<ref>Swetnam, George (1980) ''Andrew Carnegie''. Twayne Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\nWhile Carnegie did not comment on British imperialism, he strongly opposed the idea of American colonies. He opposed the annexation of the Philippines almost to the point of supporting [[William Jennings Bryan]] against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/timeline/timeline2.html Andrew Carnegie timeline of events] PBS.</ref> However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]], in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] and literary figures like [[Mark Twain]].<ref>Hirschfeld, Katherine ''Health, Politics and Revolution in Cuba'', p. 117, Transaction Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0863-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Porter, Robert Percival |title=Industrial Cuba: Being a Study of Present Commercial and Industrial Conditions, with Suggestions as to the Opportunities Presented in the Island for American Capital, Enterprise, and Labour|url=https://archive.org/details/industrialcubab00portgoog|year=1899|publisher=G.P.

From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in ''Triumphant Democracy'' (1886) and ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889).

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881. Prior to the flood, speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Less than {{convert|20|mi}} downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown.\n\nThe dam was {{convert|72|ft|m}} high and {{convert|931|ft|m}} long. Between 1881 when the club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the 3 [[cast iron]] discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown. Such repair work, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889, resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley as the Johnstown Flood.<ref>McCullough, David (1987) ''The Johnstown Flood''. Simon & Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0671207148}}</ref> When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members.\n\nAlthough Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year. After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood. The Carnegie-donated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and houses the Flood Museum.\n\n===1892: Homestead Strike===\n[[File:Homestead Strike - Mob attacking Pinkerton men.jpg|thumb|The Homestead Strike]]\n\nThe [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U.S. history. The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], and grew out of a labor dispute between the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA) and the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].\n\nCarnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked.<ref name=\"Carnegie, Andrew 1920\">''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch. 17.</ref> In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]]. Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sentiment. With the collective bargaining agreement between the union and company expiring at the end of June, Frick and the leaders of the local AA union entered into negotiations in February. With the steel industry doing well and prices higher, the AA asked for a wage increase; the AA represented about 800 of the 3,800 workers at the plant. Frick immediately countered with an average 22% wage decrease that would affect nearly half the union's membership and remove a number of positions from the bargaining unit.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_Labor_Movement_in_the_Uni.html?id=NZY8mAT222EC |title=History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume Two: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism |last=Foner |first=Philip Sheldon |date=1975 |publisher=International Pub |isbn=9780717803880 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead]]\nThe union and company failed to come to an agreement, and management locked the union out. Workers considered the stoppage a \"[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]\" by management and not a \"strike\" by workers. As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing [[Labor history of the United States|labor rights movement]], strongly opposed by management. Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them.\n\nOn July 6, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men \u2014 seven strikers and three Pinkertons \u2014 were killed and hundreds were injured. Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert E. Pattison|Robert Pattison]] ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site. Then allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding him. While not directly connected to the strike, Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt. According to Berkman, \"...{{nbsp}}with the elimination of Frick, responsibility for Homestead conditions would rest with Carnegie.\"<ref>Berkman, Alexander (1912) [https://archive.org/details/prisonmemoirsan01berkgoog ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist''].

Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of \"commercial murder\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system. Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies.

In his 1854 essay \"Manners and Fashion\", Spencer referred to public education as \"Old schemes\". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, \"political, religious, literary, philanthropic\", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its \"original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism\".<ref>Spencer, Herbert. 1854 (''Manners and Fashion'') ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 74639\u201374656).

In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of [[Calvinism]], and religion as a whole, but reconciled with it later in his life.

Although, being a child, his family led vigorous theological and political disputes. His mother avoided the topic of religion. His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation, while, according to Carnegie, still remaining very religious on his own.\n\nWitnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]]</ref> Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, \"Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.\"<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 339</ref>\n\nLater in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member of [[Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church]], pastored from 1905 to 1926 by [[Social Gospel]] exponent [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], while his wife and daughter belonged to the [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/04/23/archives/bagpipe-tunes-at-carnegie-wedding-charm-of-bonnie-scotland-lent-to.html \"Bagpipe Tunes at Carnegie Wedding\"].

These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.<ref>Carnegie, ''An American Four-in-Hand in Britain'' (New York, 1883), pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nDespite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for the newly-established [[International Court of Arbitration]]'s [[Peace Palace]] \u2013 brainchild of Russian Tsar [[Nicolas II]].<ref name=\"MoscowTimes\">{{cite web |last1=Gay |first1=Mark H |title=The Hague Peace Palace Keeps Tsar's Vision Alive |url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html |website=The Moscow Times |accessdate=August 8, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808232924/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html |archivedate=August 8, 2016 |date=November 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.<ref>David S. Patterson,\"Andrew Carnegie's quest for world peace.\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 114.5 (1970): 371\u2013383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/985802 online]</ref> In 1913, at the dedication of the Peace Palace in The Hague, Carnegie predicted that the end of war was ''as certain to come, and come soon, as day follows night.''<ref>Cited in Bruno Tertrais \"The Demise of Ares: The End of War as We Know It?\" ''The Washington Quarterly'', 35/3, (2012): p. 17.\n</ref>\n\nIn 1914, on the eve of the First World War, Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union (CPU), a group of leaders in religion, academia, and politics. Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.\n\nDespite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.\n\n===US colonial expansion===\nOn the matter of [[American imperialism|American colonial expansion]], Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the [[Newlands Resolution|annexation of the Hawaiian islands]] or [[Puerto Rico]], but he opposed the [[Philippine\u2013American War|annexation of the Philippines]]. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence.<ref>Carnegie, ''Americanism Versus Imperialism'', esp. pp. 12\u201313</ref> This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.\n\nAfter he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British writer [[William T. Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:\n\n{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision. I wonder that you do not see this. There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaire's money. Its life is tainted thereby.<ref>Quoted in Hendrick, B. J. (1932) ''The Life of Andrew Carnegie'', Vol.2, p. 337. Garden City, NY [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA376]</ref>}}\n\nCarnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.\n\nLike Stead, he believed that the United States and the [[British Empire]] would merge into one nation, telling him \"We are heading straight to the Re-United States\". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/406/mode/2up |title=The Americanization of the World |publisher=Horace Markley |author=Stead, W.T. |year=1901 |pages=406\u201312}}</ref> The creation of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the \"scientific\" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patterson, David S. |title=Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=114 |issue=5 |year=1970 |pages=371\u201383 |jstor=985802}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nCarnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labor issues.

Hendrick]]:\n:His benefactions amounted to $350,000,000 \u2013 for he gave away not only his annual income of something more than $12,500,000, but most of the principal as well. Of this sum, $62,000,000 was allotted to the British Empire and $288,000,000 to the United States, for Carnegie, in the main, confined his benefactions to the English-speaking nations. His largest gifts were $125,000,000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (this same body also became his residuary legatee),  $60,000,000 to public library buildings, $20,000,000 to colleges (usually the smaller ones), $6,000,000 to church organs, $29,000,000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, $10,000,000 to Hero Funds, $10,000,000 to the Endowment for International Peace, $10,000,000 to the Scottish Universities Trust, $10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Trust, and $3,750,000 to the Dunfermline Trust.<ref>Burton J. Hendrick, \"Carnegie, Andrew, 1835\u20131919\" ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1929) v. 3 p. 505.</ref>\n\nHendrick argues that:\n:These gifts fairly picture Carnegie's conception of the best ways to improve the status of the common man. They represent all his personal tastes \u2013 his love of books, art, music, and nature \u2013 and the reforms which he regarded as most essential to human progress \u2013 scientific research, education both literary and technical, and, above all, the abolition of war. The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegie's name is that for public libraries. Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fund \u2013 among other reasons, because \"it came up my ain back\"; but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance. There was only one genuine remedy, he believed, for the ills that beset the human race, and that was enlightenment. \"Let there be light\" was the motto that, in the early days, he insisted on placing in all his library buildings. As to the greatest endowment of all, the Carnegie Corporation, that was merely Andrew Carnegie in permanently organized form; it was established to carry on, after Carnegie's death, the work to which he had given personal attention in his own lifetime.<ref>Hendrick, \"Carnegie, Andrew, 1835\u20131919\"</ref>\n\n===Research sources===\nCarnegie's personal papers are at the [[Library of Congress]] Manuscript Division.\nThe Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie: The [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] (CCNY); The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] (CEIP); the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] (CFAT);The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs (CCEIA). These collections deal primarily with Carnegie philanthropy and have very little personal material related to Carnegie. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] jointly administer the Andrew Carnegie Collection of digitized archives on Carnegie's life.\n\n==Works==\n<!--chronological list of works by Carnegie himself-->\n*Wall, Joseph Frazier, ed.

The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Stewart's performance.\n\n==Plot==\nMaureen is a personal shopper in Paris for Kyra, a demanding supermodel. Her twin brother Lewis recently died from a heart condition, a condition shared by Maureen. They were both interested in [[spiritualism]] and felt they were mediums.\n\nMaureen stays overnight at her late brother's home, hoping for a sign from him, and has a brief encounter with a spiritual presence. His girlfriend Lara wants to sell the mansion to a couple who knew and loved her brother, but they want Maureen to find out if the mansion has spirits, benevolent or malevolent. Maureen and her brother had promised each other that who ever died first would give the other a sign after death. During her discussion with the potential buyers, Maureen discovers the artist [[Hilma af Klint]], whose paintings were inspired by messages from the spirit world. Maureen video chats with her boyfriend Gary, who is on a contract job in [[Oman]] and encourages her to get away from Paris and Kyra and to come visit. He tells her there is nothing after death.\n\nAt Kyra's apartment, Maureen meets and talks with Kyra's lover Ingo, who tells her Kyra is planning to break up with him because she is afraid her husband will discover their relationship. Maureen spends another night at Lewis' home and the faucets turn on. She asks Lewis to talk with her, and discovers that her artwork has been scratched out. She is terrified by an aggressive, angry specter of a woman. Maureen flees the house.\n\nOn her way to London to pick up clothing for Kyra, Maureen receives a series of text messages from an unknown number, which she suspects is her late brother Lewis. The sender toys with Maureen, and encourages her to try on Kyra's clothes, which she has been forbidden to do. She spends the night in Kyra's bed, in a dress collected from London. The female spectre appears in the bedroom whilst Maureen sleeps for a few seconds, causing Maureen to wake up suddenly. The next morning, Maureen visits Lara to tell her that there is no longer a supernatural presence in the mansion. The sender also leaves her a room key for a hotel. When she visits the room in one of Kyra's dresses, no one is there, but when she checks at the front desk, she discovers the room is booked in her name and has been pre-paid in cash.\n\nAfter picking up expensive jewelry for Kyra, Maureen returns to Kyra's apartment, where she discovers Kyra's bloody corpse, and sees fleeting images. She is questioned by the police, who ask about the location of the jewelry. Later, Maureen discovers the jewelry is in her apartment. The unknown texter demands she return to the hotel room, which she does, with the jewelry.\n\nDoors in the hotel open and close, although no one is seen going through them. Ingo leaves the hotel, and is apprehended by two men. He shoots one and attempts to escape. However, he is arrested and confesses to murdering Kyra.\n\nMaureen meets Lara's new boyfriend Erwin, who was friends with Lewis before his death. They speak about the possibility that Lewis's soul is still present. As Maureen sits in the garden, a wind stirs, and a glass behind her levitates and falls to the floor.\n\nMaureen flies to Oman to visit Gary in the mountains. Arriving at his room, she hears a noise and finds a glass floating in the air; it falls and shatters. She asks questions, accepting single thumps as yes, two for no. When she eventually asks her twice-repeated question, \"Lewis, is it you,\" there is silence. She then asks, \"Or is it just me?\" A single thump for yes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Maureen Cartwright\n* [[Lars Eidinger]] as Ingo\n* [[Nora Waldst\u00e4tten]] as Kyra Gellman\n* [[Anders Danielsen Lie]] as Erwin\n* Sigrid Bouaziz as Lara\n* Ty Olwin as Gary\n* Audrey Bonnet as Cassandre\n* [[Pascal Rambert]] as Jerome\n* Hammou Graia as Police Officer\n* [[Benjamin Biolay]] as [[Victor Hugo]]\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2015, it was announced that [[Olivier Assayas]] would be directing the film, from a screenplay he wrote, with [[Kristen Stewart]] starring.

The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Stewart's performance.\n\n==Plot==\nMaureen is a personal shopper in Paris for Kyra, a demanding supermodel. Her twin brother Lewis recently died from a heart condition, a condition shared by Maureen. They were both interested in [[spiritualism]] and felt they were mediums.\n\nMaureen stays overnight at her late brother's home, hoping for a sign from him, and has a brief encounter with a spiritual presence. His girlfriend Lara wants to sell the mansion to a couple who knew and loved her brother, but they want Maureen to find out if the mansion has spirits, benevolent or malevolent. Maureen and her brother had promised each other that who ever died first would give the other a sign after death. During her discussion with the potential buyers, Maureen discovers the artist [[Hilma af Klint]], whose paintings were inspired by messages from the spirit world. Maureen video chats with her boyfriend Gary, who is on a contract job in [[Oman]] and encourages her to get away from Paris and Kyra and to come visit. He tells her there is nothing after death.\n\nAt Kyra's apartment, Maureen meets and talks with Kyra's lover Ingo, who tells her Kyra is planning to break up with him because she is afraid her husband will discover their relationship. Maureen spends another night at Lewis' home and the faucets turn on. She asks Lewis to talk with her, and discovers that her artwork has been scratched out. She is terrified by an aggressive, angry specter of a woman. Maureen flees the house.\n\nOn her way to London to pick up clothing for Kyra, Maureen receives a series of text messages from an unknown number, which she suspects is her late brother Lewis. The sender toys with Maureen, and encourages her to try on Kyra's clothes, which she has been forbidden to do. She spends the night in Kyra's bed, in a dress collected from London. The female spectre appears in the bedroom whilst Maureen sleeps for a few seconds, causing Maureen to wake up suddenly. The next morning, Maureen visits Lara to tell her that there is no longer a supernatural presence in the mansion. The sender also leaves her a room key for a hotel. When she visits the room in one of Kyra's dresses, no one is there, but when she checks at the front desk, she discovers the room is booked in her name and has been pre-paid in cash.\n\nAfter picking up expensive jewelry for Kyra, Maureen returns to Kyra's apartment, where she discovers Kyra's bloody corpse, and sees fleeting images. She is questioned by the police, who ask about the location of the jewelry. Later, Maureen discovers the jewelry is in her apartment. The unknown texter demands she return to the hotel room, which she does, with the jewelry.\n\nDoors in the hotel open and close, although no one is seen going through them. Ingo leaves the hotel, and is apprehended by two men. He shoots one and attempts to escape. However, he is arrested and confesses to murdering Kyra.\n\nMaureen meets Lara's new boyfriend Erwin, who was friends with Lewis before his death. They speak about the possibility that Lewis's soul is still present. As Maureen sits in the garden, a wind stirs, and a glass behind her levitates and falls to the floor.\n\nMaureen flies to Oman to visit Gary in the mountains. Arriving at his room, she hears a noise and finds a glass floating in the air; it falls and shatters. She asks questions, accepting single thumps as yes, two for no. When she eventually asks her twice-repeated question, \"Lewis, is it you,\" there is silence. She then asks, \"Or is it just me?\" A single thump for yes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Maureen Cartwright\n* [[Lars Eidinger]] as Ingo\n* [[Nora Waldst\u00e4tten]] as Kyra Gellman\n* [[Anders Danielsen Lie]] as Erwin\n* Sigrid Bouaziz as Lara\n* Ty Olwin as Gary\n* Audrey Bonnet as Cassandre\n* [[Pascal Rambert]] as Jerome\n* Hammou Graia as Police Officer\n* [[Benjamin Biolay]] as [[Victor Hugo]]\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2015, it was announced that [[Olivier Assayas]] would be directing the film, from a screenplay he wrote, with [[Kristen Stewart]] starring.

A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUntil recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n<gallery>\nFile:1st Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 1st SFG(A)\nFile:3rd Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 3rd SFG(A)\nFile:5h Special Forces Group - 4 battalions.jpg|Current structure of the 5th SFG(A)\nFile:7th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 7th SFG(A)\nFile:10th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 10th SFG(A)\nFile:20th Special Operations Group - New nomenclature.JPG|Current structure of the 20th SFG(A) (ARNG)\n</gallery>\n\nA Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions.

The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the \"Team Sergeant\"), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants or Sergeants. This organization facilitates 6-man \"split team\" operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.\n\n==Qualifications==\n[[File:A Special Forces candidate and several role players conduct planning during ROBIN SAGE.jpg|thumb|right|A Special Forces candidate conducts a pre-mission rehearsal with Army ROTC cadets role-playing guerrilla fighters during ROBIN SAGE.]]\n[[File:C-130J HALO jump 140422-F-RH756-417.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Special Forces Group conduct [[High-altitude military parachuting|high-altitude low-opening]] (HALO) jump over Yakima training center, c. 2014]]\n[[File:Alabama National Guard controlled ascent (17310136912).jpg|thumb|20th Special Forces Group soldiers conduct dive operations]]\n\nThe basic eligibility requirements to be considered for entry into the Special Forces are:\n\n:*Be age 20\u201336.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goarmysof.com/sf-qualifications/|title=Qualifications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=goarmysof.com|accessdate=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n:*Be a U.S. citizen.\n:*Be a high school graduate.\n:*Score a General Technical score of 110 or higher or a combat operation score of 110 on the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]].\n:*Airborne qualified or volunteer for Airborne training\n:*Must pass the Physical Fitness Assessment with at least 49 push-ups, 59 sit-ups, six pull-ups, and run two miles in a maximum of 15:12.\n:*Meet medical fitness standards as outlined in SF Physical IAW AR 40-501\n:*Must successfully complete the Pre-Basic Task list.\n:*Eligible for a secret security clearance\n:*Swim 50 m wearing [[Army Combat Boot|boots]] and [[Army Combat Uniform|ACUs]] prior to SFQC\n:*Must have 20/20 or corrected to 20/20 in both near and distant vision in both eyes.\n:*One year of college is preferred, but it is not mandatory for enlistment.\n\n==Selection and training==\n{{Main|United States Army Special Forces selection and training}}\n\nThe Special Forces soldier trains on a regular basis over the course of their entire career.

The length of the Q Course changes depending on the applicant's primary job field within Special Forces and their assigned foreign language capability, but will usually last between 55 and 95 weeks. After successfully completing the Special Forces Qualification Course, Special Forces soldiers are then eligible for many advanced skills courses.

Preparing for a 12 October visit to the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the president sent word to the center's commander, Colonel [[William P.

This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]\nThe origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\".

The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]).

Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs.

An ODA is identified by its group, battalion, company, and the team itself. For example, ODA 1234 would be the fourth team in the third company of the second battalion of 1st Special Forces Group.\n\nAn ODA consists of 12 soldiers, each of whom has a specific function (MOS or [[Military Occupational Specialty]]) on the team, however all members of an ODA conduct cross-training. The ODA is led by an 18A (Detachment Commander), a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], and a 180A (Assistant Detachment Commander) who is their second in command, usually a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Warrant Officer]] One or Chief Warrant Officer Two. The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the \"Team Sergeant\"), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants or Sergeants. This organization facilitates 6-man \"split team\" operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.\n\n==Qualifications==\n[[File:A Special Forces candidate and several role players conduct planning during ROBIN SAGE.jpg|thumb|right|A Special Forces candidate conducts a pre-mission rehearsal with Army ROTC cadets role-playing guerrilla fighters during ROBIN SAGE.]]\n[[File:C-130J HALO jump 140422-F-RH756-417.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Special Forces Group conduct [[High-altitude military parachuting|high-altitude low-opening]] (HALO) jump over Yakima training center, c. 2014]]\n[[File:Alabama National Guard controlled ascent (17310136912).jpg|thumb|20th Special Forces Group soldiers conduct dive operations]]\n\nThe basic eligibility requirements to be considered for entry into the Special Forces are:\n\n:*Be age 20\u201336.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goarmysof.com/sf-qualifications/|title=Qualifications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=goarmysof.com|accessdate=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n:*Be a U.S. citizen.\n:*Be a high school graduate.\n:*Score a General Technical score of 110 or higher or a combat operation score of 110 on the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]].\n:*Airborne qualified or volunteer for Airborne training\n:*Must pass the Physical Fitness Assessment with at least 49 push-ups, 59 sit-ups, six pull-ups, and run two miles in a maximum of 15:12.\n:*Meet medical fitness standards as outlined in SF Physical IAW AR 40-501\n:*Must successfully complete the Pre-Basic Task list.\n:*Eligible for a secret security clearance\n:*Swim 50 m wearing [[Army Combat Boot|boots]] and [[Army Combat Uniform|ACUs]] prior to SFQC\n:*Must have 20/20 or corrected to 20/20 in both near and distant vision in both eyes.\n:*One year of college is preferred, but it is not mandatory for enlistment.\n\n==Selection and training==\n{{Main|United States Army Special Forces selection and training}}\n\nThe Special Forces soldier trains on a regular basis over the course of their entire career.

This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]\nThe origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\".

The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]).

This was due to a disagreement with the bishop of [[Diocese of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]], Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope]] [[John Paul I]], over the appointment of the local priest.\n\n== Background ==\nMontaner is a [[frazione]] in the municipality of [[Sarmede]] in the [[Province of Treviso]], Italy. On December 13, 1966, Giuseppe Fa\u00e8, the [[parish]] [[priest]], died.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607552761|title=Conversion in the age of pluralism|date=2009|publisher=Brill|others=Giordan, Giuseppe.|year=|isbn=978-90-474-4494-7|location=Leiden|pages=246|oclc=607552761}}</ref> Fa\u00e8, who had served the community for forty years, had proven popular with the people of Montaner.<ref name=\":0\" /> He aided in the obtaining electricity and running water for the village, the construction of a new school, and even aided in the organization of anti-fascist resistance to the [[Operation Achse|German Occupation]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607552761|title=Conversion in the age of pluralism|date=2009|publisher=Brill|others=Giordan, Giuseppe.|year=|isbn=978-90-474-4494-7|location=Leiden|pages=246-247|oclc=607552761}}</ref> After his death, the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]] decided to appoint Giovanni Gava as the new priest, which was unpopular among the villagers. They instead supported Antonio Botteon, who, for a long time, had assisted the old priest.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607552761|title=Conversion in the age of pluralism|date=2009|publisher=Brill|others=Giordan, Giuseppe.|year=|isbn=978-90-474-4494-7|location=Leiden|pages=247|oclc=607552761}}</ref> As a last resort, Botteon was asked to become the vice-rector of the parish.\n\nOn January 21st, 1967, the new priest arrived in town, however, the night before his arrival, the townspeople erected a wall blocking the entrance of the church, and a mob of townspeople prevented him from carrying out his work.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \nLuciani replied that for a village as small as Montaner, one priest was enough, while noting that priests are not elected by the people but appointed by their bishop. The bishop appointed a former Franciscan as a temporary rector, Father Casimiro from [[Monselice]], again failing to meet the citizens' requests.\n\nLuciani's final decision was to appoint a new rector, Pietro Varnier.

The main bowlers purchased by the franchise were [[R.P. Singh]], [[Nuwan Zoysa]] and [[Chaminda Vaas]]. The other Indian players are [[Rohit Sharma]], [[Yalaka Venugopal Rao|Venugopal Rao]], and [[Pragyan Ojha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl/content/squad/338087.html|title=Deccan Chargers Squad / Players|access-date=15 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607104834/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl/content/squad/338087.html|archive-date=7 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Performance====\nDespite the fact that the team was one of the favorites to win the [[2008 Indian Premier League|inaugural edition of the IPL]], the team finished last. [[Andrew Symonds]], who was Deccan's most expensive player, batted only 3 innings before leaving to play for the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian national team]]. In addition, the team captain [[V.V.S. Laxman]] had an injury which ended his season after 6 games. Only three bowlers [[R. P. Singh]], [[Pragyan Ojha]] and [[Shahid Afridi]] took more than 4 wickets in the competition. In this 14 match period, the team went on a losing streak and failed to win a single match at home and only managed 2 wins overall, one against the [[Mumbai Indians]] and one against the [[Chennai Super Kings]] and as a result they finished at the bottom of the table.\n\n===2009 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2009}}\n\n====New administration and support staff====\nAfter the debacle of 2008, the team management sacked the entire administration associated with the tournament in that year.  They removed their CEO J. Kalyan Krishnan, Coach [[Robin Singh (cricketer, born 1963)|Robin Singh]] and the Captain [[V.V.S. Laxman]] and replaced them with Tim Wright, the former Australian batsman [[Darren Lehmann]] and former Australian Wicket-keeper [[Adam Gilchrist]] respectively. Many new players were taken from domestic circuit and also few new international players were signed. The 2008 sponsor [[Jaypee Group]] withdrew its sponsorship due to the 2008 debacle. After this, the Deccan Chargers went through a complete makeover, including changing the colours of the team from pale brown to vibrant blue and a new logo displaying a more vibrant charging bull with [[Deccan Chronicle]] as the primary sponsor for the team. Among the other members of the support staff, their physio Sean Slattery and performance analyst Unni Krishnan were retained and were part of the team to win the IPL second edition in 2009 which was held in South Africa.\n\n====Tradings====\nIn low key trading of players, the Deccan Chargers management had placed [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Herschelle Gibbs]] up for sale, a direct result of their below par performance during the 2008 season. However, no franchise owners were interested in purchasing these two players. Later, the Deccan Chargers management severed all ties with [[Shahid Afridi]], due to his disagreement with former team captain [[V.V.S. Laxman]]. Also, Former Indian all-rounder [[Sanjay Bangar]] was transferred to the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]].\n\n====New signings====\nBefore the second player auction took place the management signed [[Queensland]] all-rounder [[Ryan Harris (cricketer)|Ryan Harris]] owing to a strong recommendation from coach [[Darren Lehmann]]. In the resulting auction the Deccan Chargers franchise acquired two [[West Indies|West Indian]] players, [[Fidel Edwards]] for a fee of $150,000, and [[Dwayne Smith]] for $100,000. Seven new domestic players were also signed up including batsmen [[Tirumalasetti Suman]] and Abhinav Kumar, and bowler [[Shoaib Maqsusi]] from the [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] team after their consistent performances on the domestic circuit. Baroda batsman Azhar Bilakhia and two fast bowlers from [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], Jaskarandeep Singh and [[Harmeet Singh (cricketer born 1987)|Harmeet Singh]] were also signed on.\n\n====Performance====\nWith the below-par performance in the inaugural season and finishing at the bottom, Deccan staged an inspired comeback in 2009 by winning the second IPL season. After having an undefeated run in the initial league stage, the team suffered minor setbacks by losing some close matches. But the return of [[Andrew Symonds]], [[Rohit Sharma]] regaining form and the continuing exuberance of captain [[Adam Gilchrist]] bolstered the side. Some luck came in Charger's way towards the end of the league stage, with Kings Punjab and Rajasthan Royals losing key matches, enabling the Chargers into the semi-finals. During the semi-finals against the [[Delhi Daredevils]], who were at the top of the table, few gave the Chargers a chance of an outside win. But against the odds, Gilchrist scored a sensational 85 off just 35 balls to put the Daredevils out of the competition and give the Chargers their first IPL final against the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]].\n\nIn the final match, Gilchrist got out for a duck in the first over, however the Chargers managed to recover and posted a total of 143 for the loss of 6 wickets. Many felt that a good defending total could have been a further 20\u201330 runs. The Chargers came out with all guns blazing right from the first ball, and this spirited effort ensured that they successfully defended the total, winning the game by 6 runs and lifting the prized IPL trophy.\n\n===2010 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2010}}\nOn 11 August 2009, Dinesh Wadhwa, former Regional Manager of ICICI Bank was appointed chief operating officer for 2010.\n\n====New signing====\n\n=====Foreign inclusions=====\n*[[Kemar Roach]], [[Mitchell Marsh]]\n\n=====Domestic inclusions=====\n*Anirudh Singh, [[Mohnish Mishra]], Ashish Reddy, Bodapati Sumanth, [[Rahul Sharma (cricketer, born 1986)|Rahul Sharma]]\n\n=====Contracts bought out=====\n*[[Chamara Silva]], [[Nuwan Zoysa]]\n\n====Performance====\nAfter winning 2009, there were lots of expectations on Chargers. Team opened with a loss in their inaugural match against KKR but subsequently won next 3 matches. But thereafter Chargers went on to lose the next 5 matches. With a situation where many doubted whether Chargers will be able to make to next round but it has made it by winning next 5 consecutive matches and qualifying for playoffs. But Chargers lost both games in play-offs i.e. Semifinals and 3rd place. [[Pragyan Ojha]] won the [[Purple Cap]] by becoming the highest wicket taker for them in the same season.\n\n[[File:Indian Premier League Deccan Chargers vs Delhi Daredevils in RGIS Hyderabad 2.JPG|thumbnail|Deccan Chargers home crowd in 2011]]\n\n===2011 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2011}}\nBefore the start of auction Chargers decided not to retain any players and have put all the players in auction. The much awaited Auction on 8 and 9 January 2011 lived up to the expectation; in fact it exceeded in many ways. Daniel Christian was termed as million dollar baby as he was hardly known to the world cricket at that point of time. Chargers did pick very good players in Cameron White, JP Duminy, Ishant Sharma, Dale Steyn and skipper Kumar Sangakkara. But at the same time Chargers lost many of Indian players such RP Singh and [[Rohit Sharma]] as well as Australians [[Andrew Symonds]] and Adam Gilchrist.\n\n====New signings====\n\n=====Foreign inclusions=====\n*[[Kumar Sangakkara]], [[Cameron White]], [[Dale Steyn]], [[Michael Lumb (cricketer)|Michael Lumb]], [[Daniel Christian]], [[Rusty Theron]], [[JP Duminy]], [[Chris Lynn]]\n\n=====Indian players inclusions=====\n*'''Capped Players''': [[Shikhar Dhawan]], [[Ishant Sharma]], [[Harmeet Singh (cricketer born 1987)|Harmeet Singh]], [[Pragyan Ojha]], [[Amit Mishra]], [[Manpreet Gony]]\n*'''Uncapped Players''': [[Bharat Chipli]], [[Ishan Malhotra]], [[Ishank Jaggi]], [[Sunny Sohal]], [[Jaydev Shah]], [[Prem Vardhan]], [[Anand Rajan]], [[Kedar Devdhar]], [[Dwaraka Ravi Teja]], [[Arjun Yadav]], [[Ashish Reddy]] and [[Akash Bhandari]].\n\n====Performance====\nTeam started the campaign by losing first 2 games but team won next match. There after team started losing badly despite winning some games and was therefore eliminated from the competition. But team bounced back by showing pride by winning final 3 matches which did not allow a chance for other teams for qualifiers. Team disappointing performance was clearly due to inexperience in the squad especially due to lack of Indian international batsmen. Fans of DC have criticized management for not holding back [[Rohit Sharma]] during player retention. Chargers got to play IPL matches at Hyderabad after almost 3 years, but dismal performance at their home ground continued with a win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Knight Riders, Pune Warriors and Kings XI Punjab. They ended on a high with 3 consecutive wins but could not scale above 7th position in the league standings.\n\n===2012 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2012}}\nIn [[2012 Indian Premier League]], Chargers named new fielding coach [[Trevor Penney]] replacing [[Mike Young (cricket)|Mike Young]].\n\n====New signings and tradings====\nIn the trading window which opened in December, Chargers traded off [[Kevin Pietersen]], [[Harmeet Singh (cricketer born 1987)|Harmeet Singh]] and [[Pragyan Ojha]] to [[Delhi Daredevils]], [[Kings XI Punjab]], [[Mumbai Indians]] respectively. During player auctions, Chargers had tried to bid [[Ravindra Jadeja]] for entire $2m but eventually lost to the Super Kings in tie breaker. Later they acquired following players-\n\n=====Players acquired=====\n[[Daniel Harris (cricketer)|Daniel Harris]] ($70,000), [[Darren Bravo]] ($100,000), [[Parthiv Patel]] ($650,000)\n\nAfter the auction, they signed up a few uncapped players such as [[TP Sudhindra]], [[Tanmay Srivastava]], [[Biplab Samantray]], [[Akshath Reddy]] and [[Ashish Reddy]] owing to their strong domestic performances.\n\n=====Contracts bought out=====\n[[Michael Lumb (cricketer)|Michael Lumb]], [[Jaydev Shah]], Ishan Malhotra\n\n====Performance====\nThe Chargers failed to deliver on a consistent basis in 2012 with narrow and consecutive defeats. [[Shikhar Dhawan]], [[Dale Steyn]] and [[Cameron White]] were the only players who helped the team put up a fight. Team weakness was the bowling and fielding department, with fast bowler [[Ishant Sharma]] being ruled out due to injury and spinner Pragyan Ojha traded to Mumbai Indians. Deccan finished eighth out of the nine teams in the league stage points table, after languishing at the bottom for most part of the season. Deccan Chargers came into the season being characterized as 'underdogs', and they are yet to lose that name.\n\n==Champions League Twenty20==\n{{main|Twenty20 Champions League}}\nThe '''Twenty20 Champions League''' is an international [[Twenty20]] cricket competition between clubs from [[India]], [[Australia]], [[England and Wales|England]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[New Zealand]] and [[West Indies]].

In this 14 match period, the team went on a losing streak at home and only managed 2 wins overall, one against the [[Mumbai Indians]] and one against the [[Chennai Super Kings]] and as a result they finished at the bottom of the table.\n\n===2009 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2009}}\n\n====New administration and support staff====\nAfter the debacle of 2008, the team management sacked the entire administration associated with the tournament in that year.  They removed their CEO J. Kalyan Krishnan, Coach [[Robin Singh (cricketer, born 1963)|Robin Singh]] and the Captain [[V.V.S. Laxman]] and replaced them with Tim Wright, the former Australian batsman [[Darren Lehmann]] and former Australian Wicket-keeper [[Adam Gilchrist]] respectively. Many new players were taken from domestic circuit and also few new international players were signed. The 2008 sponsor [[Jaypee Group]] withdrew its sponsorship due to the 2008 debacle. After this, the Deccan Chargers went through a complete makeover, including changing the colours of the team from pale brown to vibrant blue and a new logo displaying a more vibrant charging bull with [[Deccan Chronicle]] as the primary sponsor for the team. Among the other members of the support staff, their physio Sean Slattery and performance analyst Unni Krishnan were retained and were part of the team to win the IPL second edition in 2009 which was held in South Africa.\n\n====Tradings====\nIn low key trading of players, the Deccan Chargers management had placed [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Herschelle Gibbs]] up for sale, a direct result of their below par performance during the 2008 season. However, no franchise owners were interested in purchasing these two players. Later, the Deccan Chargers management severed all ties with [[Shahid Afridi]], due to his disagreement with former team captain [[V.V.S. Laxman]]. Also, Former Indian all-rounder [[Sanjay Bangar]] was transferred to the [[Kolkata Knight Riders]].\n\n====New signings====\nBefore the second player auction took place the management signed [[Queensland]] all-rounder [[Ryan Harris (cricketer)|Ryan Harris]] owing to a strong recommendation from coach [[Darren Lehmann]]. In the resulting auction the Deccan Chargers franchise acquired two [[West Indies|West Indian]] players, [[Fidel Edwards]] for a fee of $150,000, and [[Dwayne Smith]] for $100,000. Seven new domestic players were also signed up including batsmen [[Tirumalasetti Suman]] and Abhinav Kumar, and bowler [[Shoaib Maqsusi]] from the [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] team after their consistent performances on the domestic circuit. Baroda batsman Azhar Bilakhia and two fast bowlers from [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], Jaskarandeep Singh and [[Harmeet Singh (cricketer born 1987)|Harmeet Singh]] were also signed on.\n\n====Performance====\nWith the below-par performance in the inaugural season and finishing at the bottom, Deccan staged an inspired comeback in 2009 by winning the second IPL season. After having an undefeated run in the initial league stage, the team suffered minor setbacks by losing some close matches. But the return of [[Andrew Symonds]], [[Rohit Sharma]] regaining form and the continuing exuberance of captain [[Adam Gilchrist]] bolstered the side. Some luck came in Charger's way towards the end of the league stage, with Kings Punjab and Rajasthan Royals losing key matches, enabling the Chargers into the semi-finals. During the semi-finals against the [[Delhi Daredevils]], who were at the top of the table, few gave the Chargers a chance of an outside win. But against the odds, Gilchrist scored a sensational 85 off just 35 balls to put the Daredevils out of the competition and give the Chargers their first IPL final against the [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]].\n\nIn the final match, Gilchrist got out for a duck in the first over, however the Chargers managed to recover and posted a total of 143 for the loss of 6 wickets. Many felt that a good defending total could have been a further 20\u201330 runs. The Chargers came out with all guns blazing right from the first ball, and this spirited effort ensured that they successfully defended the total, winning the game by 6 runs and lifting the prized IPL trophy.\n\n===2010 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2010}}\nOn 11 August 2009, Dinesh Wadhwa, former Regional Manager of ICICI Bank was appointed chief operating officer for 2010.\n\n====New signing====\n\n=====Foreign inclusions=====\n*[[Kemar Roach]], [[Mitchell Marsh]]\n\n=====Domestic inclusions=====\n*Anirudh Singh, [[Mohnish Mishra]], Ashish Reddy, Bodapati Sumanth, [[Rahul Sharma (cricketer, born 1986)|Rahul Sharma]]\n\n=====Contracts bought out=====\n*[[Chamara Silva]], [[Nuwan Zoysa]]\n\n====Performance====\nAfter winning 2009, there were lots of expectations on Chargers. Team opened with a loss in their inaugural match against KKR but subsequently won next 3 matches. But thereafter Chargers went on to lose the next 5 matches. With a situation where many doubted whether Chargers will be able to make to next round but it has made it by winning next 5 consecutive matches and qualifying for playoffs. But Chargers lost both games in play-offs i.e. Semifinals and 3rd place. [[Pragyan Ojha]] won the [[Purple Cap]] by becoming the highest wicket taker for them in the same season.\n\n[[File:Indian Premier League Deccan Chargers vs Delhi Daredevils in RGIS Hyderabad 2.JPG|thumbnail|Deccan Chargers home crowd in 2011]]\n\n===2011 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2011}}\nBefore the start of auction Chargers decided not to retain any players and have put all the players in auction. The much awaited Auction on 8 and 9 January 2011 lived up to the expectation; in fact it exceeded in many ways. Daniel Christian was termed as million dollar baby as he was hardly known to the world cricket at that point of time. Chargers did pick very good players in Cameron White, JP Duminy, Ishant Sharma, Dale Steyn and skipper Kumar Sangakkara. But at the same time Chargers lost many of Indian players such RP Singh and [[Rohit Sharma]] as well as Australians [[Andrew Symonds]] and Adam Gilchrist.\n\n====New signings====\n\n=====Foreign inclusions=====\n*[[Kumar Sangakkara]], [[Cameron White]], [[Dale Steyn]], [[Michael Lumb (cricketer)|Michael Lumb]], [[Daniel Christian]], [[Rusty Theron]], [[JP Duminy]], [[Chris Lynn]]\n\n=====Indian players inclusions=====\n*'''Capped Players''': [[Shikhar Dhawan]], [[Ishant Sharma]], [[Harmeet Singh (cricketer born 1987)|Harmeet Singh]], [[Pragyan Ojha]], [[Amit Mishra]], [[Manpreet Gony]]\n*'''Uncapped Players''': [[Bharat Chipli]], [[Ishan Malhotra]], [[Ishank Jaggi]], [[Sunny Sohal]], [[Jaydev Shah]], [[Prem Vardhan]], [[Anand Rajan]], [[Kedar Devdhar]], [[Dwaraka Ravi Teja]], [[Arjun Yadav]], [[Ashish Reddy]] and [[Akash Bhandari]].\n\n====Performance====\nTeam started the campaign by losing first 2 games but team won next match. There after team started losing badly despite winning some games and was therefore eliminated from the competition. But team bounced back by showing pride by winning final 3 matches which did not allow a chance for other teams for qualifiers. Team disappointing performance was clearly due to inexperience in the squad especially due to lack of Indian international batsmen. Fans of DC have criticized management for not holding back [[Rohit Sharma]] during player retention. Chargers got to play IPL matches at Hyderabad after almost 3 years, but dismal performance at their home ground continued with a win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Knight Riders, Pune Warriors and Kings XI Punjab. They ended on a high with 3 consecutive wins but could not scale above 7th position in the league standings.\n\n===2012 season===\n{{main|Deccan Chargers in 2012}}\nIn [[2012 Indian Premier League]], Chargers named new fielding coach [[Trevor Penney]] replacing [[Mike Young (cricket)|Mike Young]].\n\n====New signings and tradings====\nIn the trading window which opened in December, Chargers traded off [[Kevin Pietersen]], [[Harmeet Singh (cricketer born 1987)|Harmeet Singh]] and [[Pragyan Ojha]] to [[Delhi Daredevils]], [[Kings XI Punjab]], [[Mumbai Indians]] respectively. During player auctions, Chargers had tried to bid [[Ravindra Jadeja]] for entire $2m but eventually lost to the Super Kings in tie breaker. Later they acquired following players-\n\n=====Players acquired=====\n[[Daniel Harris (cricketer)|Daniel Harris]] ($70,000), [[Darren Bravo]] ($100,000), [[Parthiv Patel]] ($650,000)\n\nAfter the auction, they signed up a few uncapped players such as [[TP Sudhindra]], [[Tanmay Srivastava]], [[Biplab Samantray]], [[Akshath Reddy]] and [[Ashish Reddy]] owing to their strong domestic performances.\n\n=====Contracts bought out=====\n[[Michael Lumb (cricketer)|Michael Lumb]], [[Jaydev Shah]], Ishan Malhotra\n\n====Performance====\nThe Chargers failed to deliver on a consistent basis in 2012 with narrow and consecutive defeats. [[Shikhar Dhawan]], [[Dale Steyn]] and [[Cameron White]] were the only players who helped the team put up a fight. Team weakness was the bowling and fielding department, with fast bowler [[Ishant Sharma]] being ruled out due to injury and spinner Pragyan Ojha traded to Mumbai Indians. Deccan finished eighth out of the nine teams in the league stage points table, after languishing at the bottom for most part of the season. Deccan Chargers came into the season being characterized as 'underdogs', and they are yet to lose that name.\n\n==Champions League Twenty20==\n{{main|Twenty20 Champions League}}\nThe '''Twenty20 Champions League''' is an international [[Twenty20]] cricket competition between clubs from [[India]], [[Australia]], [[England and Wales|England]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[New Zealand]] and [[West Indies]]. The competition was launched in 2008 as a response to the success of national Twenty20 domestic cricket leagues, most notably the [[Indian Premier League]].\n\n===2009 season===\n{{main|2009 Twenty20 Champions League}}\nOn account of emerging as the winners of the 2009 season of the [[Indian Premier League]], the team participated in the inaugural edition of the [[T20 Champions League]], along with two other Indian teams: the runners-up of IPL 2009, [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]], and [[Delhi Daredevils]], the toppers of the league-stage points table.\n\nThey were knocked out in the group stages after losing to the [[Somerset Sabres]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team|Trinidad & Tobago]], who they were drawn against in Group A.\n\n==Honours==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"background:#fff; width:50%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n!

The Zulu language possesses several click sounds typical of Southern African languages, not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have coexisted with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.\n\nZulu, like most indigenous Southern African languages, was not a [[written language]] until the arrival of missionaries from Europe, who documented the language using the [[Latin script]]. \nThe first grammar book of the Zulu language was published in [[Norway]] in 1850 by the Norwegian missionary [[Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder|Hans Schreuder]].<ref>Rakkenes, \u00d8ystein (2003) ''Himmelfolket: En Norsk H\u00f8vding i Zululand'', Oslo: Cappelen Forlag, pp. 63\u201365</ref> The first written document in Zulu was a Bible translation that appeared in 1883. In 1901, [[John Dube]] (1871\u20131946), a Zulu from Natal, created the [[Ohlange Institute]], the first native educational institution in South Africa. He was also the author of ''Insila kaShaka'', the first novel written in Zulu (1930). Another pioneering Zulu writer was [[Rolfes Robert Reginald Dhlomo|Reginald Dhlomo]], author of several historical novels of the 19th-century leaders of the Zulu nation: ''U-Dingane'' (1936), ''U-Shaka'' (1937), ''U-Mpande'' (1938), ''U-Cetshwayo'' (1952) and ''U-Dinizulu'' (1968). Other notable contributors to Zulu literature include [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] and, more recently, [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]].\n\nThe written form of Zulu was controlled by the [[Zulu Language Board]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. This board has now been disbanded and superseded by the Pan South African Language Board<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |title=pansalb.org.za |access-date=17 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141039/http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |archive-date=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which promotes the use of all eleven official languages of South Africa.\n\n==Contemporary usage==\nEnglish, Dutch and later [[Afrikaans]] had been the only official languages used by all South African governments before 1994. However, in the [[Kwazulu]] [[bantustan]] the Zulu language was widely used. All education in the country at the high-school level was in English or Afrikaans. Since the demise of apartheid in 1994, Zulu has been enjoying a marked revival. Zulu-language television was introduced by the [[SABC]] in the early 1980s and it broadcasts news and many shows in Zulu. Zulu radio is very popular and newspapers such as ''isoLezwe'',<ref>[http://www.isolezwe.co.za/ isolezwe.co.za]</ref> ''Ilanga''<ref>[http://www.ilanganews.co.za/ ilanganews.co.za]</ref> and ''UmAfrika'' in the Zulu language are available in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] province and in [[Johannesburg]]. In January 2005 the first full-length feature film in Zulu, ''[[Yesterday (2004 film)|Yesterday]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].\n\nSouth African [[matriculation]] requirements no longer specify which South African language needs to be taken as a second language, and some people have made the switch to learning Zulu. However people taking Zulu at high-school level overwhelmingly take it as a first language: according to statistics, [[Afrikaans]] is still over 30 times more popular than Zulu as a ''second'' language. The mutual intelligibility of many [[Nguni languages]] has increased the likelihood of Zulu becoming the [[lingua franca]] of the eastern half of the country, although the political dominance of Xhosa-speaking people on national level militates against this.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (The predominant language in the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]] is Afrikaans \u2013 see the map below.)\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]'', in the \"[[Circle of Life]]\" song, the phrases ''Ingonyama nengw' enamabala'' (English: ''A lion and a leopard spots''), ''Nans' ingonyama bakithi Baba'' (English: ''Here comes a lion, Father'') and ''Siyonqoba'' (English: ''We will conquer'') were used. In some movie songs, like \"This Land\", the voice says ''Busa leli zwe bo'' (''Rule this land'') and ''Busa ngothando bo'' (''Rule with love'') were used too.\n\nThe song ''[[Siyahamba]]'' is a South African hymn originally written in the Zulu language that became popular in North American churches in the 1990s.\n\n===Standard vs urban Zulu===\n[[standard language|Standard]] Zulu as it is taught in schools, also called \"deep Zulu\" (''isiZulu esijulile''), differs in various respects from the language spoken by people living in cities (urban Zulu, ''isiZulu sasedolobheni''). Standard Zulu tends to be [[Linguistic purism|purist]], using derivations from Zulu words for new concepts, whereas speakers of urban Zulu use [[loan words]] abundantly, mainly from English. For example: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Standard Zulu\n! urban Zulu\n!

For example, the word ''ithambo'' {{IPA|/\u00ed\u02d0t\u02b0\u00e1mb\u00f3/}} \"bone\", is a contraction of an earlier ''ilithambo'' {{IPA|/\u00edl\u00edt\u02b0\u00e1mb\u00f3/}}, which may still be used by some speakers. Likewise, ''uphahla'' {{IPA|/\u00fa\u02d0p\u02b0a\u026ca/}} \"roof\" is a contraction of earlier ''uluphahla'' {{IPA|/ul\u00fap\u02b0a\u026ca/}}.

Recent loanwords contain {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} in other positions, e.g. ''isekhondi'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0sek\u02b0o\u02d0ndi/}} \"second\", ''ibhayisikili'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0bajisiki\u02d0li/}} \"bicycle\".\n# The [[slack voice|slack-voiced]] consonants are [[depressor consonant]]s. These have a lowering effect on the tone of their syllable. \n# The consonant {{IPA|/\u014b/}} occurs in some dialects as a reduction of the cluster {{IPA|/n\u0261/}} when it is not in stem-initial position, and is therefore always slack-voiced.\n# The trill {{IPA|/r/}} is not native to Zulu and occurs only in expressive words and in recent borrowings from European languages.\n\nThe use of [[click consonant]]s is one of the most distinctive features of Zulu. This feature is shared with several other languages of Southern Africa, but it is very rare in other regions. There are three basic articulations of clicks in Zulu:\n* [[Dental click|Denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|/\u01c0/}}, comparable to a sucking of teeth, as the sound one makes for 'tsk tsk'.\n* [[Postalveolar click|Alveolar]] {{IPA|/!/}}, comparable to a bottle top 'pop'.\n* [[Alveolar lateral click|Lateral]] {{IPA|/\u01c1/}}, comparable to a click that one may do for a walking horse.\n\nEach articulation covers five click consonants, with differences such as being slack-voiced, [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[nasalisation|nasalised]], for a total of 15.\n\n===Phonotactics===\n\nZulu syllables are canonically (N)C(w)V, and words must always end in a vowel. Consonant clusters consist of any consonant, optionally preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal consonant (so-called \"prenasalisation\", described in more detail below) and optionally followed by the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}.\n\nIn addition, syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329/}} occurs as a reduction of former {{IPA|/mu/}}, and acts like a true syllable: it can be syllabic even when not word-initial, and can also carry distinctive tones like a full syllable. It does not necessarily have to be homorganic with the following consonant, although the difference between homorganic nonsyllabic {{IPA|/mC/}} and syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329C/}} is distinctive, e.g. ''umpetshisi'' {{IPA|/um\u0329p\u00e9t\u0283i\u02d0si/}} \"peach tree\" (5 syllables) versus ''impoko'' {{IPA|/\u00edmpo\u02d0\u0260o/}} \"grass flower\" (3 syllables). Moreover, sequences of syllabic ''m'' and homorganic ''m'' can occur, e.g. ''ummbila'' {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329mb\u00ed\u02d0la/}} \"maize\" (4 syllables).\n\nRecent loanwords from languages such as English may violate these constraints, by including additional consonant clusters that are not native to Zulu, such as in ''igremu'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0gre\u02d0mu/}} \"[[gram]]\". There may be some variation between speakers as to whether clusters are broken up by an [[epenthetic vowel]] or not, e.g. ''ikhompiyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompiju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} or ''ikhompyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} \"computer\".\n\n===Prosody===\n\n====Stress====\n\nStress in Zulu words is mostly predictable and normally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. It is accompanied by allophonic lengthening of the vowel. When the final vowel of a word is long due to contraction, it receives the stress instead of the preceding syllable.\n\nLengthening does not occur on all words in a sentence, however, but only those that are sentence- or phrase-final. Thus, for any word of at least two syllables, there are two different forms, one with penultimate length and one without it, occurring in complementary distribution. In some cases, there are morphemic alternations that occur as a result of word position as well. The remote demonstrative pronouns may appear with the suffix ''-ana'' when sentence-final, but only as ''-\u0101'' otherwise. Likewise, the recent past tense of verbs ends in ''-ile'' sentence-finally, but is reduced to ''-\u0113'' medially. Moreover, a falling tone can only occur on a long vowel, so the shortening has effects on tone as well.\n\nSome words, such as ideophones or interjections, can have stress that deviates from the regular pattern.\n\n====Tone====\n\nLike almost all other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and other [[African languages]], Zulu is [[tonal Languages|tonal]]. There are three main ''tonemes'': low, high and falling. Zulu is conventionally written without any indication of tone, but tone can be distinctive in Zulu. For example, the words for \"priest\" and \"teacher\" are both spelled ''umfundisi'', but they are pronounced with different tones: {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329f\u00fandisi/}} for the \"priest\" meaning, and {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329fund\u00edsi/}} for the \"teacher\" meaning.\n\nIn principle, every syllable can be pronounced with either a high or a low tone. However, low tone does not behave the same as the other two, as high tones can \"spread\" into low-toned syllables while the reverse does not occur. A low tone is therefore better described as the ''absence'' of any toneme; it is a kind of default tone that is overridden by high or falling tones. The falling tone is a sequence of high-low, and occurs only on long vowels. The penultimate syllable can also bear a falling tone when it is long due to the word's position in the phrase. However, when it shortens, the falling tone becomes disallowed in that position.{{clarify|reason=What happens to it?|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn principle, every [[morpheme]] has an inherent underlying tone pattern which does not change regardless of where it appears in a word. However, like most other Bantu languages, Zulu has [[word tone]], meaning that the pattern of tones acts more like a template to assign tones to individual syllables, rather than a direct representation of the pronounced tones themselves. Consequently, the relationship between underlying tone patterns and the tones that are actually pronounced can be quite complex. Underlying high tones tend to surface rightward from the syllables where they are underlyingly present, especially in longer words.\n\n====Depressor consonants====\n\nThe breathy consonant phonemes in Zulu are [[depressor consonant]]s, or depressors for short. Depressor consonants have a lowering effect on pitch, adding a non-phonemic low-tone onset to the normal tone of the syllable. Thus, in syllables with depressor consonants, high tones are realised as rising, and falling tones as rising-then-falling. In both cases, the pitch does not reach as high as in non-depressed syllables. The possible tones on a syllable with a voiceless consonant like ''hla'' are {{IPA|[\u026c\u00e1 \u026c\u00e2 \u026c\u00e0]}}, and the possible tones of a breathy consonant syllable, like ''dla'', are {{IPA|[\u026e\u01ce\u0324 \u026ea\u0324\u1dc8 \u026e\u00e0\u0324]}}. A depressor has no effect on a syllable that's already low, but it blocks assimilation to a preceding high tone, so that the tone of the depressor syllable and any following low-tone syllables stays low.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\n====Prenasalisation====\n\nPrenasalisation occurs whenever a consonant is preceded by a homorganic nasal, either lexically or as a consequence of prefixation. The most notable case of the latter is the class 9 noun prefix ''in-'', which ends in a homorganic nasal. Prenasalisation triggers several changes in the following consonant, some of which are phonemic and others allophonic. The changes can be summed as follows:<ref>Rycroft & Ngcobo (1979) ''Say it in Zulu'', p. 6</ref><ref>''Zulu-English dictionary'', C.M. Doke & B.W. Vilakazi</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A toneless syllable between a high-tone syllable and another tonic syllable assimilates to that high tone. That is, if the preceding syllable ends on a high tone and the following syllable begins with a high tone (because it is high or falling), the intermediate toneless syllable has its pitch raised as well. When the preceding syllable is high but the following is toneless, the medial toneless syllable adopts a high-tone onset from the preceding syllable, resulting in a falling tone contour.\n\nFor example, the English word ''spoon'' was borrowed into Zulu as ''isipunu'', phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edsip\u00fanu/}}. The second syllable ''si'' assimilates to the surrounding high tones, raising its pitch, so that it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00eds\u00edp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally. If tone pitch is indicated with numbers, with 1 highest and 9 lowest pitch, then the pitches of each syllable can be denoted as 2-4-3-9.<ref>''Zulu-English Dictionary'', Doke, 1958</ref> The second syllable is thus still lower in pitch than both of the adjacent syllables.\n\n====Tone displacement====\n\nDepressor consonants have an effect called ''tone displacement''. Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable. If the next syllable is long, it gets a falling tone, otherwise a regular high tone. If the penultimate syllable becomes high (not falling), the final syllable [[dissimilation|dissimilates]] and becomes low if it wasn't already. Tone displacement is blocked under the following conditions:\n* When the syllable has a long vowel.\n* When the following syllable also has a depressor consonant.\n* When the following syllable is the final syllable, and is short.\n\nWhenever tone displacement is blocked, this results in a depressor syllable with high tone, which will have the low-tone onset as described above. When the following syllable already has a high or falling tone, the tone disappears from the syllable as if it had been shifted away, but the following syllable's tone is not modified.\n\nSome examples:\n* ''izipunu'' \"spoons\", the plural of ''isipunu'' from the previous section, is phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edzip\u00fanu/}}. Because {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor consonant, tone assimilation is prevented. Consequently, the word is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u00edz\u00ecp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally, with low tone in the second syllable.\n* ''izintombi'' \"girls\" is phonemically {{IPA|/iz\u00edntomb\u00ed/}}. {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor, and is not blocked, so the tone shifts to the third syllable. This syllable can be either long or short depending on sentence position. When long, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f4mb\u00ed]}}, with a falling tone. However, when the third syllable is short, the tone is high, and dissimilation of the final syllable occurs, resulting in {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f3mb\u00ec]}}.\n* ''nendoda'' \"with a man\" is phonemically {{IPA|/n\u02b1\u00e9ndoda/}}. {{IPA|/n\u02b1/}} is a depressor, but so is {{IPA|/d/}}, so tone displacement is blocked. Consequently, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[n\u02b1\u011bnd\u0254\u0300\u02d0d\u00e0]}}, with rising pitch in the first syllable due to the low-onset effect.\n\n====Palatalisation====\n\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalisation]] is a change that affects labial and alveolar consonants whenever they are immediately followed by {{IPA|/j/}}. While palatalisation occurred historically, it is still productive, and occurs as a result of the addition of suffixes beginning with {{IPA|/j/}}. A frequent example is the diminutive suffix ''-yana''.\n\nMoreover, Zulu does not generally tolerate sequences of a labial consonant plus {{IPA|/w/}}. Whenever {{IPA|/w/}} follows a labial consonant, it changes to {{IPA|/j/}}, which then triggers palatalisation of the consonant. This effect can be seen in the locative forms of nouns ending in ''-o'' or ''-u'', which changes to ''-weni'' and ''-wini'' respectively in the locative. If a labial consonant immediately precedes, palatalisation is triggered. The change also occurs in nouns beginning in ''ubu-'' with a stem beginning with a vowel.\n\nThe following changes occur as a result of palatalisation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

A common former practice was to indicate the implosive {{IPA|/\u0253/}} using the special letter ''\u0253'', while the digraph ''bh'' would then be simply written as ''b''. Some references may also write ''h'' after letters to indicate that they are of the depressor variety, e.g. ''mh'', ''nh'', ''yh'', a practice that is standard in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] orthography.\n\nVery early texts, from the early 20th century or before, tend to omit the distinction between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants, writing the latter without the ''h''.\n\nNouns are written with their prefixes as one orthographical word. If the prefix ends with a vowel (as most do) and the noun stem also begins with a vowel, a hyphen is inserted in between, e.g. ''i-Afrika''. This occurs only with loanwords.\n\n==Morphology==\n{{main article|Zulu grammar}}\nHere are some of the main features of Zulu:\n\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n* Morphologically, it is an [[agglutinative language]].\n* As in other Bantu languages, Zulu nouns are classified into [[noun class|morphological classes]] or ''[[grammatical gender|genders]]'' (16 in Zulu), with different prefixes for singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Such agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which it is agreeing. An example is the use of the class 'aba-':\n\n::'''B'''onke '''aba'''ntu '''aba'''qatha '''ba'''sepulazini '''ba'''yagawula.\n\n::''All the strong people of the farm are felling (trees).''\n\n:The various agreements that qualify the word 'abantu' (people) can be seen in effect.\n\n* Its verbal system shows a combination of temporal and aspectual categories in their finite paradigm. Typically verbs have two stems, one for present-undefinite and another for perfect. Different prefixes can be attached to these verbal stems to specify subject agreement and various degrees of past or future tense. For example, in the word ''uyathanda'' (\"he loves\"), the present stem of the verb is ''-thanda'', the prefix ''u-'' expresses third-person singular subject and ''-ya-'' is a filler that is used in short sentences.\n:Suffixes are also put into common use to show the causative or reciprocal forms of a verb stem.\n* Most property words (words encoded as adjectives in English) are represented by relative. In the sentence ''umuntu ubomvu'' (\"the person is red\"), the word ''ubomvu'' (root ''-bomvu'') behaves like a verb and uses the agreement prefix ''u-''. however, there are subtle differences; for example, it does not use the prefix ''ya-''.\n\n===Morphology of root ''Zulu''===\nThe root can be combined with a number of prefixes and thus create other words. For example, here is a table with a number of words constructed from the roots -''Zulu'' and ''-ntu'' (the root for ''person/s'', ''people''):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Prefix !! -zulu !! -ntu\n|-\n| '''um(u)''' || um''Zulu'' (a Zulu person) || umu''ntu'' (a person)\n|-\n| '''ama, aba''' || ama''Zulu'' (Zulu people) || aba''ntu'' (people)\n|-\n| '''isi''' || isi''Zulu'' (the Zulu language) || isi''ntu'' (culture, heritage, mankind)\n|-\n| '''ubu''' || ubuZulu (personification/Zulu-like tendencies) || ubu''ntu'' (humanity, compassion)\n|-\n| '''kwa''' || kwa''Zulu'' (place of the Zulu people) || \u2013\n|-\n| '''i(li)''' || i''zulu'' (the weather/sky/heaven) || \u2013\n|-\n| '''pha''' || phe''zulu'' (on top) || \u2013\n|-\n| '''e''' || e''zul''wini (in, at, to, from heaven) || \u2013\n|-\n|}\n\n==Sample phrases and text==\nThe following is a list of phrases that can be used when one visits a region whose primary language is Zulu:\n\n{|\n|-\n| Sawubona || ''Hello'', to one person\n|- \n| Sanibonani || ''Hello'', to a group of people\n|-\n| Unjani? / Ninjani? || ''How are you (sing.)? / How are you (pl.)?''\n|-\n| Ngiyaphila / Siyaphila || ''I'm okay / We're okay''\n|-\n| Ngiyabonga (kakhulu) || ''Thanks (a lot)''\n|-\n| Ngubani igama lakho? || ''What is your name?''\n|-\n| Igama lami ngu... || ''My name is...''\n|-\n| Isikhathi sithini? || ''What's the time?''\n|- \n| Ngingakusiza? || ''Can I help you?''\n|-\n| Uhlala kuphi? || ''Where do you stay?''\n|-\n| Uphumaphi? || ''Where are you from?''\n|-\n| Hamba kahle / Sala kahle || ''Go well / Stay well'', used as goodbye.

The Zulu language possesses several click sounds typical of Southern African languages, not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have coexisted with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.\n\nZulu, like most indigenous Southern African languages, was not a [[written language]] until the arrival of missionaries from Europe, who documented the language using the [[Latin script]]. \nThe first grammar book of the Zulu language was published in [[Norway]] in 1850 by the Norwegian missionary [[Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder|Hans Schreuder]].<ref>Rakkenes, \u00d8ystein (2003) ''Himmelfolket: En Norsk H\u00f8vding i Zululand'', Oslo: Cappelen Forlag, pp. 63\u201365</ref> The first written document in Zulu was a Bible translation that appeared in 1883. In 1901, [[John Dube]] (1871\u20131946), a Zulu from Natal, created the [[Ohlange Institute]], the first native educational institution in South Africa. He was also the author of ''Insila kaShaka'', the first novel written in Zulu (1930). Another pioneering Zulu writer was [[Rolfes Robert Reginald Dhlomo|Reginald Dhlomo]], author of several historical novels of the 19th-century leaders of the Zulu nation: ''U-Dingane'' (1936), ''U-Shaka'' (1937), ''U-Mpande'' (1938), ''U-Cetshwayo'' (1952) and ''U-Dinizulu'' (1968). Other notable contributors to Zulu literature include [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] and, more recently, [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]].\n\nThe written form of Zulu was controlled by the [[Zulu Language Board]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. This board has now been disbanded and superseded by the Pan South African Language Board<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |title=pansalb.org.za |access-date=17 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141039/http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |archive-date=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which promotes the use of all eleven official languages of South Africa.\n\n==Contemporary usage==\nEnglish, Dutch and later [[Afrikaans]] had been the only official languages used by all South African governments before 1994. However, in the [[Kwazulu]] [[bantustan]] the Zulu language was widely used. All education in the country at the high-school level was in English or Afrikaans. Since the demise of apartheid in 1994, Zulu has been enjoying a marked revival. Zulu-language television was introduced by the [[SABC]] in the early 1980s and it broadcasts news and many shows in Zulu. Zulu radio is very popular and newspapers such as ''isoLezwe'',<ref>[http://www.isolezwe.co.za/ isolezwe.co.za]</ref> ''Ilanga''<ref>[http://www.ilanganews.co.za/ ilanganews.co.za]</ref> and ''UmAfrika'' in the Zulu language are available in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] province and in [[Johannesburg]]. In January 2005 the first full-length feature film in Zulu, ''[[Yesterday (2004 film)|Yesterday]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].\n\nSouth African [[matriculation]] requirements no longer specify which South African language needs to be taken as a second language, and some people have made the switch to learning Zulu. However people taking Zulu at high-school level overwhelmingly take it as a first language: according to statistics, [[Afrikaans]] is still over 30 times more popular than Zulu as a ''second'' language. The mutual intelligibility of many [[Nguni languages]] has increased the likelihood of Zulu becoming the [[lingua franca]] of the eastern half of the country, although the political dominance of Xhosa-speaking people on national level militates against this.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (The predominant language in the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]] is Afrikaans \u2013 see the map below.)\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]'', in the \"[[Circle of Life]]\" song, the phrases ''Ingonyama nengw' enamabala'' (English: ''A lion and a leopard spots''), ''Nans' ingonyama bakithi Baba'' (English: ''Here comes a lion, Father'') and ''Siyonqoba'' (English: ''We will conquer'') were used. In some movie songs, like \"This Land\", the voice says ''Busa leli zwe bo'' (''Rule this land'') and ''Busa ngothando bo'' (''Rule with love'') were used too.\n\nThe song ''[[Siyahamba]]'' is a South African hymn originally written in the Zulu language that became popular in North American churches in the 1990s.\n\n===Standard vs urban Zulu===\n[[standard language|Standard]] Zulu as it is taught in schools, also called \"deep Zulu\" (''isiZulu esijulile''), differs in various respects from the language spoken by people living in cities (urban Zulu, ''isiZulu sasedolobheni''). Standard Zulu tends to be [[Linguistic purism|purist]], using derivations from Zulu words for new concepts, whereas speakers of urban Zulu use [[loan words]] abundantly, mainly from English. For example: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Standard Zulu\n! urban Zulu\n! English\n|-\n| ''umakhalekhukhwini''\n| ''icell''\n| cell/mobile phone\n|-\n| ''Ngiyezwa''\n| ''Ngiya-andastenda''\n| I understand\n|}\nThis situation has led to problems in education because standard Zulu is often not understood by young people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Magagula|first=Constance Samukelisiwe|title=Standard Versus Non-standard IsiZulu: A Comparative Study Between Urban and Rural Learners' Performance and Attitude|year=2009|publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal|location=Durban}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Vowels===\n[[File:Zulu vowel chart.svg|right|upright=1.13|thumb|Zulu vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Wade|1996}}]]\nZulu has a simple vowel system consisting of five vowels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

For example, the word ''ithambo'' {{IPA|/\u00ed\u02d0t\u02b0\u00e1mb\u00f3/}} \"bone\", is a contraction of an earlier ''ilithambo'' {{IPA|/\u00edl\u00edt\u02b0\u00e1mb\u00f3/}}, which may still be used by some speakers. Likewise, ''uphahla'' {{IPA|/\u00fa\u02d0p\u02b0a\u026ca/}} \"roof\" is a contraction of earlier ''uluphahla'' {{IPA|/ul\u00fap\u02b0a\u026ca/}}.

Recent loanwords contain {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} in other positions, e.g. ''isekhondi'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0sek\u02b0o\u02d0ndi/}} \"second\", ''ibhayisikili'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0bajisiki\u02d0li/}} \"bicycle\".\n# The [[slack voice|slack-voiced]] consonants are [[depressor consonant]]s.

This feature is shared with several other languages of Southern Africa, but it is very rare in other regions. There are three basic articulations of clicks in Zulu:\n* [[Dental click|Denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|/\u01c0/}}, comparable to a sucking of teeth, as the sound one makes for 'tsk tsk'.\n* [[Postalveolar click|Alveolar]] {{IPA|/!/}}, comparable to a bottle top 'pop'.\n* [[Alveolar lateral click|Lateral]] {{IPA|/\u01c1/}}, comparable to a click that one may do for a walking horse.\n\nEach articulation covers five click consonants, with differences such as being slack-voiced, [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[nasalisation|nasalised]], for a total of 15.\n\n===Phonotactics===\n\nZulu syllables are canonically (N)C(w)V, and words must always end in a vowel. Consonant clusters consist of any consonant, optionally preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal consonant (so-called \"prenasalisation\", described in more detail below) and optionally followed by the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}.\n\nIn addition, syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329/}} occurs as a reduction of former {{IPA|/mu/}}, and acts like a true syllable: it can be syllabic even when not word-initial, and can also carry distinctive tones like a full syllable. It does not necessarily have to be homorganic with the following consonant, although the difference between homorganic nonsyllabic {{IPA|/mC/}} and syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329C/}} is distinctive, e.g. ''umpetshisi'' {{IPA|/um\u0329p\u00e9t\u0283i\u02d0si/}} \"peach tree\" (5 syllables) versus ''impoko'' {{IPA|/\u00edmpo\u02d0\u0260o/}} \"grass flower\" (3 syllables). Moreover, sequences of syllabic ''m'' and homorganic ''m'' can occur, e.g. ''ummbila'' {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329mb\u00ed\u02d0la/}} \"maize\" (4 syllables).\n\nRecent loanwords from languages such as English may violate these constraints, by including additional consonant clusters that are not native to Zulu, such as in ''igremu'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0gre\u02d0mu/}} \"[[gram]]\". There may be some variation between speakers as to whether clusters are broken up by an [[epenthetic vowel]] or not, e.g. ''ikhompiyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompiju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} or ''ikhompyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} \"computer\".\n\n===Prosody===\n\n====Stress====\n\nStress in Zulu words is mostly predictable and normally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. It is accompanied by allophonic lengthening of the vowel. When the final vowel of a word is long due to contraction, it receives the stress instead of the preceding syllable.\n\nLengthening does not occur on all words in a sentence, however, but only those that are sentence- or phrase-final. Thus, for any word of at least two syllables, there are two different forms, one with penultimate length and one without it, occurring in complementary distribution. In some cases, there are morphemic alternations that occur as a result of word position as well. The remote demonstrative pronouns may appear with the suffix ''-ana'' when sentence-final, but only as ''-\u0101'' otherwise. Likewise, the recent past tense of verbs ends in ''-ile'' sentence-finally, but is reduced to ''-\u0113'' medially. Moreover, a falling tone can only occur on a long vowel, so the shortening has effects on tone as well.\n\nSome words, such as ideophones or interjections, can have stress that deviates from the regular pattern.\n\n====Tone====\n\nLike almost all other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and other [[African languages]], Zulu is [[tonal Languages|tonal]]. There are three main ''tonemes'': low, high and falling. Zulu is conventionally written without any indication of tone, but tone can be distinctive in Zulu. For example, the words for \"priest\" and \"teacher\" are both spelled ''umfundisi'', but they are pronounced with different tones: {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329f\u00fandisi/}} for the \"priest\" meaning, and {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329fund\u00edsi/}} for the \"teacher\" meaning.\n\nIn principle, every syllable can be pronounced with either a high or a low tone. However, low tone does not behave the same as the other two, as high tones can \"spread\" into low-toned syllables while the reverse does not occur. A low tone is therefore better described as the ''absence'' of any toneme; it is a kind of default tone that is overridden by high or falling tones. The falling tone is a sequence of high-low, and occurs only on long vowels. The penultimate syllable can also bear a falling tone when it is long due to the word's position in the phrase. However, when it shortens, the falling tone becomes disallowed in that position.{{clarify|reason=What happens to it?|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn principle, every [[morpheme]] has an inherent underlying tone pattern which does not change regardless of where it appears in a word. However, like most other Bantu languages, Zulu has [[word tone]], meaning that the pattern of tones acts more like a template to assign tones to individual syllables, rather than a direct representation of the pronounced tones themselves. Consequently, the relationship between underlying tone patterns and the tones that are actually pronounced can be quite complex. Underlying high tones tend to surface rightward from the syllables where they are underlyingly present, especially in longer words.\n\n====Depressor consonants====\n\nThe breathy consonant phonemes in Zulu are [[depressor consonant]]s, or depressors for short. Depressor consonants have a lowering effect on pitch, adding a non-phonemic low-tone onset to the normal tone of the syllable. Thus, in syllables with depressor consonants, high tones are realised as rising, and falling tones as rising-then-falling. In both cases, the pitch does not reach as high as in non-depressed syllables. The possible tones on a syllable with a voiceless consonant like ''hla'' are {{IPA|[\u026c\u00e1 \u026c\u00e2 \u026c\u00e0]}}, and the possible tones of a breathy consonant syllable, like ''dla'', are {{IPA|[\u026e\u01ce\u0324 \u026ea\u0324\u1dc8 \u026e\u00e0\u0324]}}. A depressor has no effect on a syllable that's already low, but it blocks assimilation to a preceding high tone, so that the tone of the depressor syllable and any following low-tone syllables stays low.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\n====Prenasalisation====\n\nPrenasalisation occurs whenever a consonant is preceded by a homorganic nasal, either lexically or as a consequence of prefixation. The most notable case of the latter is the class 9 noun prefix ''in-'', which ends in a homorganic nasal. Prenasalisation triggers several changes in the following consonant, some of which are phonemic and others allophonic. The changes can be summed as follows:<ref>Rycroft & Ngcobo (1979) ''Say it in Zulu'', p. 6</ref><ref>''Zulu-English dictionary'', C.M. Doke & B.W. Vilakazi</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A toneless syllable between a high-tone syllable and another tonic syllable assimilates to that high tone. That is, if the preceding syllable ends on a high tone and the following syllable begins with a high tone (because it is high or falling), the intermediate toneless syllable has its pitch raised as well. When the preceding syllable is high but the following is toneless, the medial toneless syllable adopts a high-tone onset from the preceding syllable, resulting in a falling tone contour.\n\nFor example, the English word ''spoon'' was borrowed into Zulu as ''isipunu'', phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edsip\u00fanu/}}. The second syllable ''si'' assimilates to the surrounding high tones, raising its pitch, so that it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00eds\u00edp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally. If tone pitch is indicated with numbers, with 1 highest and 9 lowest pitch, then the pitches of each syllable can be denoted as 2-4-3-9.<ref>''Zulu-English Dictionary'', Doke, 1958</ref> The second syllable is thus still lower in pitch than both of the adjacent syllables.\n\n====Tone displacement====\n\nDepressor consonants have an effect called ''tone displacement''. Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable. If the next syllable is long, it gets a falling tone, otherwise a regular high tone. If the penultimate syllable becomes high (not falling), the final syllable [[dissimilation|dissimilates]] and becomes low if it wasn't already. Tone displacement is blocked under the following conditions:\n* When the syllable has a long vowel.\n* When the following syllable also has a depressor consonant.\n* When the following syllable is the final syllable, and is short.\n\nWhenever tone displacement is blocked, this results in a depressor syllable with high tone, which will have the low-tone onset as described above. When the following syllable already has a high or falling tone, the tone disappears from the syllable as if it had been shifted away, but the following syllable's tone is not modified.\n\nSome examples:\n* ''izipunu'' \"spoons\", the plural of ''isipunu'' from the previous section, is phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edzip\u00fanu/}}. Because {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor consonant, tone assimilation is prevented. Consequently, the word is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u00edz\u00ecp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally, with low tone in the second syllable.\n* ''izintombi'' \"girls\" is phonemically {{IPA|/iz\u00edntomb\u00ed/}}. {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor, and is not blocked, so the tone shifts to the third syllable. This syllable can be either long or short depending on sentence position. When long, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f4mb\u00ed]}}, with a falling tone. However, when the third syllable is short, the tone is high, and dissimilation of the final syllable occurs, resulting in {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f3mb\u00ec]}}.\n* ''nendoda'' \"with a man\" is phonemically {{IPA|/n\u02b1\u00e9ndoda/}}. {{IPA|/n\u02b1/}} is a depressor, but so is {{IPA|/d/}}, so tone displacement is blocked. Consequently, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[n\u02b1\u011bnd\u0254\u0300\u02d0d\u00e0]}}, with rising pitch in the first syllable due to the low-onset effect.\n\n====Palatalisation====\n\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalisation]] is a change that affects labial and alveolar consonants whenever they are immediately followed by {{IPA|/j/}}. While palatalisation occurred historically, it is still productive, and occurs as a result of the addition of suffixes beginning with {{IPA|/j/}}. A frequent example is the diminutive suffix ''-yana''.\n\nMoreover, Zulu does not generally tolerate sequences of a labial consonant plus {{IPA|/w/}}. Whenever {{IPA|/w/}} follows a labial consonant, it changes to {{IPA|/j/}}, which then triggers palatalisation of the consonant. This effect can be seen in the locative forms of nouns ending in ''-o'' or ''-u'', which changes to ''-weni'' and ''-wini'' respectively in the locative. If a labial consonant immediately precedes, palatalisation is triggered. The change also occurs in nouns beginning in ''ubu-'' with a stem beginning with a vowel.\n\nThe following changes occur as a result of palatalisation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

A common former practice was to indicate the implosive {{IPA|/\u0253/}} using the special letter ''\u0253'', while the digraph ''bh'' would then be simply written as ''b''. Some references may also write ''h'' after letters to indicate that they are of the depressor variety, e.g. ''mh'', ''nh'', ''yh'', a practice that is standard in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] orthography.\n\nVery early texts, from the early 20th century or before, tend to omit the distinction between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants, writing the latter without the ''h''.\n\nNouns are written with their prefixes as one orthographical word. If the prefix ends with a vowel (as most do) and the noun stem also begins with a vowel, a hyphen is inserted in between, e.g. ''i-Afrika''. This occurs only with loanwords.\n\n==Morphology==\n{{main article|Zulu grammar}}\nHere are some of the main features of Zulu:\n\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n* Morphologically, it is an [[agglutinative language]].\n* As in other Bantu languages, Zulu nouns are classified into [[noun class|morphological classes]] or ''[[grammatical gender|genders]]'' (16 in Zulu), with different prefixes for singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Such agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which it is agreeing. An example is the use of the class 'aba-':\n\n::'''B'''onke '''aba'''ntu '''aba'''qatha '''ba'''sepulazini '''ba'''yagawula.\n\n::''All the strong people of the farm are felling (trees).''\n\n:The various agreements that qualify the word 'abantu' (people) can be seen in effect.\n\n* Its verbal system shows a combination of temporal and aspectual categories in their finite paradigm. Typically verbs have two stems, one for present-undefinite and another for perfect. Different prefixes can be attached to these verbal stems to specify subject agreement and various degrees of past or future tense. For example, in the word ''uyathanda'' (\"he loves\"), the present stem of the verb is ''-thanda'', the prefix ''u-'' expresses third-person singular subject and ''-ya-'' is a filler that is used in short sentences.\n:Suffixes are also put into common use to show the causative or reciprocal forms of a verb stem.\n* Most property words (words encoded as adjectives in English) are represented by relative. In the sentence ''umuntu ubomvu'' (\"the person is red\"), the word ''ubomvu'' (root ''-bomvu'') behaves like a verb and uses the agreement prefix ''u-''. however, there are subtle differences; for example, it does not use the prefix ''ya-''.\n\n===Morphology of root ''Zulu''===\nThe root can be combined with a number of prefixes and thus create other words. For example, here is a table with a number of words constructed from the roots -''Zulu'' and ''-ntu'' (the root for ''person/s'', ''people''):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Prefix !! -zulu !! -ntu\n|-\n| '''um(u)''' || um''Zulu'' (a Zulu person) || umu''ntu'' (a person)\n|-\n| '''ama, aba''' || ama''Zulu'' (Zulu people) || aba''ntu'' (people)\n|-\n| '''isi''' || isi''Zulu'' (the Zulu language) || isi''ntu'' (culture, heritage, mankind)\n|-\n| '''ubu''' || ubuZulu (personification/Zulu-like tendencies) || ubu''ntu'' (humanity, compassion)\n|-\n| '''kwa''' || kwa''Zulu'' (place of the Zulu people) || \u2013\n|-\n| '''i(li)''' || i''zulu'' (the weather/sky/heaven) || \u2013\n|-\n| '''pha''' || phe''zulu'' (on top) || \u2013\n|-\n| '''e''' || e''zul''wini (in, at, to, from heaven) || \u2013\n|-\n|}\n\n==Sample phrases and text==\nThe following is a list of phrases that can be used when one visits a region whose primary language is Zulu:\n\n{|\n|-\n| Sawubona || ''Hello'', to one person\n|- \n| Sanibonani || ''Hello'', to a group of people\n|-\n| Unjani? / Ninjani? || ''How are you (sing.)? / How are you (pl.)?''\n|-\n| Ngiyaphila / Siyaphila || ''I'm okay / We're okay''\n|-\n| Ngiyabonga (kakhulu) || ''Thanks (a lot)''\n|-\n| Ngubani igama lakho? || ''What is your name?''\n|-\n| Igama lami ngu... || ''My name is...''\n|-\n| Isikhathi sithini? || ''What's the time?''\n|- \n| Ngingakusiza? || ''Can I help you?''\n|-\n| Uhlala kuphi? || ''Where do you stay?''\n|-\n| Uphumaphi? || ''Where are you from?''\n|-\n| Hamba kahle / Sala kahle || ''Go well / Stay well'', used as goodbye.
