The [[Amarna letters]] contain correspondence from [[Abdi-Heba]], headman<ref>Donald B. Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times,'' Princeton University Press, 1992 pp. 268, 270.</ref> of ''Urusalim'' and his [[suzerain]] [[Amenhotep III]].\n\nThe power of the Egyptians in the region began to decline in the 12th century BCE, during the [[Bronze Age collapse]]. The [[Battle of Djahy]] ([[Djahy]] being the Egyptian name for [[Canaan]]) in 1178 BCE between [[Ramesses III]] and the [[Sea Peoples]] marked the beginning of this decline. The gradual loss of a central power gave rise to independent kingdoms in the region. According to the Bible, Jerusalem at this time was known as [[Jebusite|Jebus]] and its independent [[Canaanites|Canaanite]] inhabitants at this time were known as [[Jebusites]].\n\n===Independent Israel and Judah (House of David) period===\n{{Main|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}{{Religious text primary|date=March 2012}}\n\nAccording to the Bible, the [[Israelite]] history of the city began in c. 1000 BCE, with [[King David]]'s sack of Jerusalem, following which Jerusalem became the [[City of David]] and capital of the [[United Kingdom of Israel]].<ref name=\"Slavik2001 p.60\"/> According to the [[Books of Samuel]], the [[Jebusites]] managed to resist attempts by the Israelites to capture the city, and by the time of King David were mocking such attempts, claiming that even the blind and lame could defeat the Israelite army. Nevertheless, the [[masoretic text]] for the [[Books of Samuel]] states that David managed to capture the city by stealth, sending his forces through a \"water shaft\" and attacking the city from the inside. Archaeologists now view this as implausible as the [[Gihon Spring|Gihon spring]] \u2013 the only known location from which water shafts lead into the city \u2013 is now known to have been heavily defended (and hence an attack via this route would have been obvious rather than secretive). The older{{Citation needed|reason=There is no prove that the Septuagint is older than the Massoretic Text, the latter being largely accepted by Judaism and Christianity as authentic|date=August 2017}} [[Septuagint]] text, however, suggests that rather than by a water shaft, David's forces defeated the [[Jebusites]] by using daggers rather than through the water tunnels coming through the [[Gihon spring]]. There was another king in Jerusalem, [[Araunah]], during, and possibly before, David's control of the city, according to the biblical narrative,<ref>2 Samuel 24:23, which literally has \"Araunah the King gave to the King [David]\".</ref> who was probably the Jebusite king of Jerusalem.<ref>[[Biblical Archaeology Review]], ''Reading David in Genesis'', Gary A. Rendsburg.</ref> The city, which at that point stood upon the [[Ophel]], was, according to the biblical account, expanded to the south, and declared by David to be the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. David also, according to the Books of Samuel, constructed an altar at the location of a threshing floor he had purchased from Araunah; a portion of biblical scholars view this as an attempt by the narrative's author to give an Israelite foundation to a pre-existing sanctuary.<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''.</ref>\n\nLater, according to the biblical narrative, King [[Solomon]] built a more substantive temple, the [[Temple of Solomon]], at a location which the [[Book of Chronicles]] equates with David's altar. The Temple became a major cultural centre in the region; eventually, particularly after religious reforms such as those of [[Hezekiah]] and of [[Josiah]], the Jerusalem temple became the main place of worship, at the expense of other, formerly powerful, ritual centres, such as [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] and [[Bethel]]. However, according to K. L. Noll, in Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: A Textbook on History and Religion, the Biblical account of the centralization of worship in Jerusalem is a fiction, although by the time of Josiah, the territory he ruled was so small that the Jerusalem temple became de facto the only shrine left.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/9701_10717.pdf | title=From Creation to Babel: Studies in Genesis 1\u201311 | first=Jesse | last=Rainbow | publisher=RBL | accessdate=22 April 2017 }}</ref> Solomon is also described as having created several other important building works at Jerusalem, including the construction of his palace, and the construction of the [[Millo]] (the identity of which is somewhat controversial).

[[Thomas L. Thompson]] argues that it only became a city and capable of acting as a state capital in the middle of the 7th century.<ref>Thompson, Thomas L., 1999, ''The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past'', Jonathan Cape, London, {{ISBN|978-0-224-03977-2}} p. 207</ref>\n\nBoth the Bible and regional archaeological evidence suggest the region was politically unstable during the period 925\u2013732 BCE. In 925 BCE, the region was invaded by Egyptian Pharaoh [[Sheshonk I]] of the [[Third Intermediate Period]], who is possibly the same as [[Shishak]], the first Pharaoh mentioned in the [[Bible]] who [[Sack of Jerusalem (925 BC)|captured and pillaged Jerusalem]]. Around 75 years later, Jerusalem's forces were likely involved in an indecisive battle against the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian King]] [[Shalmaneser III]] in the [[Battle of Qarqar]].

It had survived an [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|Assyrian siege in 701 BCE]] by [[Sennacherib]], unlike Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, that had fallen some twenty years previously. According to the Bible, this was a miraculous event in which an angel killed 185,000 men in Sennacherib's army. According to Sennacherib's own account preserved in the [[Taylor prism]], an inscription contemporary with the event, the king of Judah, Hezekiah, was \"shut up in the city like a caged bird\" and eventually persuaded Sennacherib to leave by sending him \"30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and diverse treasures, a rich and immense booty\".\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 597&nbsp;BCE led to the city being overcome by the [[Babylonia]]ns, who then took the young King [[Jehoiachin]] into [[Babylonian captivity]], together with most of the [[aristocracy]]. [[Zedekiah]], who had been placed on the throne by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586&nbsp;BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|recaptured the city]], killed Zedekiah's descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah's eyes so that that would be the last thing he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed [[Gedaliah]] son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by [[Baalis]], the king of [[Ammon]]. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.\n\n===Persian (Achaemenid) period===\n\n{{See also|Jerusalem during the Achaemenid period}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 250\n\n | image1 = YehudObverse.jpg\n | width1 = 228 | height1 = 221 \n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = YehudReverse.jpg\n | width2 = 228 | height2 = 212 \n | caption2 =\n\n | footer = Judean silver [[Yehud coinage|Yehud coin]] ([[ma'ah]]) from the [[History of the Jews in the Land of Israel#Fall of the Kingdom of Judah|Persian era]] with an Aramaic inscription \"\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\" (''Yehud'' \"[[Judea]]\") and a lily as a symbol of Jerusalem on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]\n}}\n\nAccording to the Bible, and perhaps corroborated by the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], after several decades of [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|captivity in Babylon]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of Babylonia, [[Cyrus&nbsp;II of Persia]] allowed the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild the Temple.

Nevertheless, Herod's descendants remained nominal kings of [[Iudaea Province]] as [[Agrippa&nbsp;I]] (41\u201344) and [[Agrippa&nbsp;II]] (48\u2013100).\n\nIn 66&nbsp;CE, the Jewish population rebelled against the Roman Empire in what is now known as the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] or ''Great Revolt''. Roman legions under future emperor [[Titus]] reconquered and subsequently destroyed much of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;CE. Also the Second Temple was burnt and all that remained was the great external (retaining) walls supporting the esplanade on which the Temple had stood, a portion of which has become known as the [[Western Wall]]. Titus' victory is commemorated by the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome. Agrippa&nbsp;II died c. 94&nbsp;CE, which brought the [[Herodian dynasty]] to an end almost thirty years after the destruction of the Second Temple. After the end of this revolt, Jews continued to live in Jerusalem in significant numbers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and were allowed to practice their religion, only if they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus|Jewish Tax]].\n\nIn the 1st century CE, Jerusalem became the birthplace of [[Early Christianity]]. According to the [[New Testament]], it is the location of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] of [[Jesus]] Christ (see also [[Jerusalem in Christianity]]). It was in Jerusalem that, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles of Christ]] received the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]] and first began preaching the [[Gospel]] and proclaiming his resurrection.

In 130, Hadrian visited the ruins of Jerusalem remaining after the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] of 66\u201373. He rebuilt the city, renaming it Aelia Capitolina in 135&nbsp;CE. Hadrian placed the city's main [[Roman Forum]] at the junction of the main [[Cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|Decumanus]], now the location of the (smaller) [[Muristan]]. Hadrian built a large temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Capitolinus]], which later became the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].<ref>[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)</ref> He placed restrictions on some Jewish practices, which caused a [[Bar Kochba revolt|revolt]] led by [[Simon Bar Kokhba]]. Hadrian responded with overwhelming force, putting down the rebellion, killing as many as a half million Jews, and resettling the city as a Roman ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. Jews were forbidden to enter the city but for a single day of the year, [[Tisha B'Av]], (the Ninth of [[Ab (month)|Av]]), the [[Jewish fast day|fast day]] on which Jews mourn the destruction of both Temples. For the next 150 years, the city remained a relatively unimportant pagan Roman town.\n\n===Post-Crisis Roman and Early Byzantine Empire period===\nThe Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], however, rebuilt Jerusalem as a Christian center of worship, building the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in 335. Jerusalem had received special recognition in Canon&nbsp;VII of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], made a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to the city and claimed to have recovered the [[True Cross|''cross of Christ'']].

Sixty years later the [[Dome of the Rock]] was built, a structure enshrining a [[Foundation Stone|stone]] from which Muhammad is said to have ascended to heaven during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra]]. (The octagonal and gold-sheeted Dome is not the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] to the south, the latest version of which was built more than three centuries later). Umar ibn al-Khattab also allowed the Jews back into the city and freedom to live and worship after four hundred years.\n\nUnder the early centuries of Muslim rule, especially during the [[Umayyad Dynasty|Umayyad]] (650\u2013750) and [[Abbasid Dynasty|Abbasid]] (750\u2013969) dynasties, the city prospered; geographers [[Ibn Hawqal]] and [[al-Istakhri]] (10th century) describe it as \"the most fertile province of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]\",{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} while its native son, the geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] (born 946) devoted many pages to its praises in his most famous work, ''The Best Divisions in the Knowledge of the Climes''.

In 1071, Jerusalem was captured by the Turkish warlord [[Atsiz ibn Uvaq]], who seized most of Syria and Palestine as part of the expansion of the [[Seljuk Turks]] throughout the Middle East. As the Turks were staunch Sunnis, they were opposed not only to the Fatimids, but also to the numerous Shia Muslims, who saw themselves removed from dominance after a century of Fatimid rule. In 1176, riots between Sunnis and Shiites in Jerusalem led to a massacre of the latter. Although the Christians of the city were left unmolested, and allowed access to the Christian holy sites, the wars with Byzantium and the general instability in Syria impeded the arrival pilgrims from Europe. The Seljuks also forbade the repair of any church, despite the damages suffered in the recent turmoils. There does not appear to have been a significant Jewish community in the city at this time.\n\nIn 1086, the Seljuk emir of [[Damascus]], [[Tutush I]], appointed [[Artuk Bey]] governor of Jerusalem. Artuk died in 1091, and his sons [[S\u00f6kmen (Artuqid)|S\u00f6kmen]] and [[Ilghazi]] succeeded him. In August 1098, while the Seljuks were distracted by the arrival of the [[First Crusade]] in Syria, the Fatimids under vizier [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] appeared before the city and laid siege to it. After six weeks, the Seljuk garrison capitulated and was allowed to leave for Damascus and Diyar Bakr. The Fatimid takeover was followed by the expulsion of most of the Sunnis, in which many of them were also killed.\n\n===Crusader period===\n{{main|History of Jerusalem during the Crusader period}}\n\nFatimid control of Jerusalem ended when it was captured by [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] in July 1099.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was ambitiously rebuilt as a great Romanesque church, and Muslim shrines on the Temple Mount (the Dome of the Rock and the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]]) were converted for Christian purposes. It is during this period of Frankish occupation that the Military Orders of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Knights Templar]] have their beginnings. Both grew out of the need to protect and care for the great influx of pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem in the 12th century.\n\n===Ayyubid, Bahri Mamluk and Burji Mamluk period===\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted until 1291; however, Jerusalem itself was recaptured by [[Saladin]] in 1187 (see [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)]]), who permitted worship of all religions. According to [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm|Rabbi Elijah of Chelm]], [[German Jews]] lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century. The story is told that a German-speaking Jew saved the life of a young German man [[surname]]d Dolberger. Thus when the [[knight]]s of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to the German city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] to repay the favor.<ref>''Seder ha-Dorot'', 1878, p. 252.</ref> Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of [[Halakha|halakic]] questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.<ref>Epstein, in ''Monatsschrift'', vol. xlvii, p. 344; [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=242&letter=J#928 ''Jerusalem: Under the Arabs''].</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of david jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[Tower of David]] (''Migdal David'') in Jerusalem today]]\n\nIn 1173 [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited Jerusalem. He described it as a small city full of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]s, [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Georgian people|Georgians]]. Two hundred Jews dwelt in a corner of the city under the [[Tower of David]]. In 1219 the walls of the city were razed by order of [[al-Mu'azzam]], the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[sultan of Damascus]]. This rendered Jerusalem defenseless and dealt a heavy blow to the city's status. The Ayyubids destroyed the walls in expectation of ceding the city to the Crusaders as part of a peace treaty. In 1229, by treaty with [[Egypt]]'s ruler [[al-Kamil]], Jerusalem came into the hands of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick&nbsp;II of Germany]]. In 1239, after a ten-year truce expired, he began to rebuild the walls; these were again demolished by [[an-Nasir Da'ud]], the emir of [[Kerak]], in the same year.\n\nIn 1243 Jerusalem came again into the power of the Christians, and the walls were repaired. The [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmian Empire]] took the city in 1244 and were in turn driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. In 1260 the Mongols under [[Hulagu Khan]] engaged in [[Mongol raids into Palestine|raids into Palestine]]. It is unclear if the Mongols were ever in Jerusalem, as it was not seen as a settlement of strategic importance at the time. However, there are reports that some of the Jews that were in Jerusalem temporarily fled to neighboring villages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn 1267 the Jewish Catalan sage [[Nahmanides]] travelled to Jerusalem. In the Old City he established the [[Ramban Synagogue]], the second oldest active synagogue in Jerusalem, after that of the [[Karaite Jews]] built about 300 years earlier. In the middle of the 13th century, Jerusalem was captured by the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]].\n\n==Early modern period==\n\nThe first provincial or superior of the Franciscan religious order, founded by [[Francis of Assisi]], was Brother Elia from [[Assisi]]. In the year 1219 the founder himself visited the region in order to preach the [[Gospel]] to the Muslims, seen as brothers and not enemies. The mission resulted in a meeting with the sultan of [[Egypt]], Malik al-Kamil, who was surprised by his unusual behaviour. The Franciscan Province of the East extended to Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, and the [[Holy Land]].

The rule of Suleiman and subsequent Ottoman Sultans brought an age of \"religious peace\"; Jew, Christian and Muslim enjoyed freedom of religion and it was possible to find a synagogue, a church and a mosque on the same street. The city remained open to all religions, although the empire's faulty management after Suleiman the Magnificent meant economical stagnation.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1700, [[Judah HeHasid (Jerusalem)|Judah HeHasid]] led the largest organized group of Jewish immigrants to the [[Land of Israel]] in centuries. His disciples built the [[Hurva Synagogue]], which served as the main synagogue in Jerusalem from the 18th century until 1948, when it was destroyed by the [[Arab Legion]].{{#tag:ref|\"This was not done in the heat of battle, but by official order.

During the course of the revolt, Jerusalem's residents administered their own affairs, engaging in virtual self-rule, until the central Ottoman authorities restored their control over the city.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Modern era==\n===Decline of the Ottoman Empire===\n{{see also|Departure from the walls}}\n\nIn the mid-19th century, with the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the city was a backwater, with a population that did not exceed 8,000. Nevertheless, it was, even then, an extremely heterogeneous city because of its significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The population was divided into four major communities&nbsp;\u2013 Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian&nbsp;\u2013 and the first three of these could be further divided into countless subgroups, based on precise religious affiliation or country of origin. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was meticulously partitioned between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Catholic]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]], and [[Ethiopian Church|Ethiopian]] churches. Tensions between the groups ran so deep that the keys to the shrine and its doors were safeguarded by a pair of 'neutral' Muslim families.\n\nAt the time, the communities were located mainly around their primary shrines. The Muslim community surrounded the [[Haram ash-Sharif]] or Temple Mount (northeast), the Christians lived mainly in the vicinity of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (northwest), the Jews lived mostly on the slope above the Western Wall (southeast), and the Armenians lived near the [[Zion Gate]] (southwest). In no way was this division exclusive, though it did form the basis of the four quarters during the British Mandate (1917\u20131948).\n\n[[File:Jerusalem1883.jpg|thumb|left|1883 map of Jerusalem]]\n\nSeveral changes with long-lasting effects on the city occurred in the mid-19th century: their implications can be felt today and lie at the root of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] over Jerusalem. The first of these was a trickle of Jewish immigrants from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The first such immigrants were [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]: some were elderly individuals, who came to die in Jerusalem and be buried on the Mount of Olives; others were students, who came with their families to await the coming of the [[Messiah]], adding new life to the local population. At the same time, European colonial powers began seeking toeholds in the city, hoping to expand their influence pending the imminent collapse of the Ottoman Empire. This was also an age of Christian religious revival, and many churches sent missionaries to [[proselytize]] among the Muslim and especially the Jewish populations, believing that this would speed the Second Coming of Christ. Finally, the combination of European colonialism and religious zeal was expressed in a new scientific interest in the biblical lands in general and Jerusalem in particular. Archeological and other expeditions made some spectacular finds, which increased interest in Jerusalem even more.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nBy the 1860s, the city, with an area of only one square kilometer, was already overcrowded. Thus began the construction of the New City, the part of Jerusalem outside of the city walls. Seeking new areas to stake their claims, the Russian Orthodox Church began constructing a complex, now known as the [[Russian Compound]], a few hundred meters from [[Jaffa Gate]]. The first attempt at residential settlement outside the walls of Jerusalem was undertaken by Jews, who built a small complex on the hill overlooking Zion Gate, across the [[Valley of Hinnom]]. This settlement, known as [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]], eventually flourished and set the precedent for other new communities to spring up to the west and north of the Old City. In time, as the communities grew and connected geographically, this became known as the New City.\n\nIn 1882, around 150 Jewish families arrived in Jerusalem from [[Yemen]]. Initially they were not accepted by the Jews of Jerusalem and lived in destitute conditions supported by the Christians of the Swedish-American colony, who called them [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]]ites.<ref name=\"Ariel\">{{Cite book| author = Tudor Parfitt | title = The road to redemption: the Jews of the Yemen, 1900\u20131950 | series = Brill's series in Jewish Studies, vol 17 | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | year = 1997 | page = 53}}</ref> In 1884, the Yemenites moved into [[Silwan]].\n\n{{wide image|Jerusalem panorama early twentieth century2.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of Jerusalem|Panorama of Jerusalem, early 20th century}}\n\n===British Mandate period===\n[[File:Ottoman surrender of Jerusalem restored.jpg|thumb|upright|The Ottoman surrender of Jerusalem to the British, 9 December 1917]]\n\nThe British were victorious over the Ottomans in the Middle East during [[World War&nbsp;I]] and victory in Palestine was a step towards dismemberment of that empire. General Sir [[Edmund Allenby]], commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, entered Jerusalem on foot out of respect for the Holy City, on 11 December 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |publisher=Owl Books e |edition=2nd reprinted |isbn=0-8050-6884-8 |date=1 September 2001 |title=[[A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peacetoendallpea00from/page/312 312\u201313] }}</ref>\n\nBy the time General Allenby took Jerusalem from the Ottomans in 1917, the new city was a patchwork of neighborhoods and communities, each with a distinct ethnic character. This continued under British rule, as the New City of Jerusalem grew outside the old city walls and the Old City of Jerusalem gradually emerged as little more than an impoverished older neighborhood. [[Sir Ronald Storrs]], the first British military governor of the city, issued a [[town planning]] order requiring new buildings in the city to be faced with [[sandstone]] and thus preserving some of the overall look of the city even as it grew.<ref name=elon>[[Amos Elon]], \"Jerusalem: City of Mirrors\". New York: Little, Brown 1989.</ref> During the 1930s, two important new institutions, the [[Hadassah|Hadassah Medical Center]] and [[Hebrew University]] were founded on Jerusalem's [[Mount Scopus]].\n\n[[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British rule]] marked, however, a period of growing unrest. Arab resentment at British rule and the influx of Jewish immigrants (by 1948 one in six Jews in Palestine lived in Jerusalem) boiled over in anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem in 1920, 1929, and the 1930s that caused significant damage and several deaths. The Jewish community organized self-defense forces in response to the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots]] and later disturbances; while other Jewish groups carried out bombings and attacks against the British, especially in response to suspected complicity with the Arabs and restrictions on immigration during World War&nbsp;II imposed by the [[White Paper of 1939]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The level of violence continued to escalate throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In July 1946 members of the underground Zionist group [[Irgun]] blew up a part of the [[King David Hotel]], where the British forces were temporarily located, an act which led to the [[King David Hotel bombing|death of 91 civilians]].\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved a [[1947 UN Partition Plan|plan]] which would partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. Each state would be composed of three major sections, linked by extraterritorial crossroads, plus an Arab enclave at [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]]. Expanded Jerusalem would fall under international control as a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|Corpus Separatum]].\n\n<center><gallery mode=nolines heights=150 widths=250>\nFile:Jewish legion hakotel 1917.jpg|[[Jewish Legion]] soldiers at the Western Wall after taking part in 1917 British conquest of Jerusalem\nFile:Image-Jerusalem Jaffa Gate-demolition.jpg|Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem during 1944 British demolition of recent construction obscuring the historic city walls\nFile:Jerusalem1947.png|Main residential areas of Jerusalem in 1947\nFile:Jerusalem boundary 1947.jpg|The Jerusalem boundary in 1947 and the proposed boundary of a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|Corpus Separatum]].\n</gallery></center>\n\n===Partition between Israel and Jordan===\n{{see also|Battle for Jerusalem}}\n[[File:1948-Jordanian artillery shelling Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Jordanian artillery shelling Jerusalem during the 1948 war]]\nAfter partition, the fight for Jerusalem escalated, with heavy casualties among both fighters and civilians on the British, Jewish, and Arab sides. By the end of March 1948, just before the British withdrawal, and with the British increasingly reluctant to intervene, the roads to Jerusalem were cut off by Arab irregulars, placing the Jewish population of the city under siege. The siege was eventually broken, though massacres of civilians occurred on both sides,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} before the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] began with the end of the British Mandate in May 1948.\n\nThe 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War led to massive displacement of Arab and Jewish populations. According to Benny Morris, due to mob and militia violence on both sides, 1,500 of the 3,500 (mostly ultra-Orthodox) Jews in the Old City evacuated to west Jerusalem as a unit.<ref name=autogenerated3>Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947\u20131949'', Revisited, Cambridge, 2004</ref> See also [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]].

The city was to be completely surrounded by the Arab state, with only a highway to connect international Jerusalem to the Jewish state.\n\nFollowing the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was divided. The Western half of the New City became part of the newly formed state of Israel, while the eastern half, along with the Old City, was occupied by Jordan.\nAccording to David Guinn,\n<blockquote>Concerning Jewish holy sites, Jordan breached its commitment to appoint a committee to discuss, among other topics, free access of Jews to the holy sites under its jurisdiction, mainly in the Western Wall and the important Jewish cemetery on the [[Mount of Olives]], as provided in the Article 8.2 of the Cease Fire Agreement between it and Israel dated April 3, 1949. Jordan permitted the paving of new roads in the cemetery, and tombstones were used for paving in Jordanian army camps.

Steinberg]], Jordan ransacked 57 ancient synagogues, libraries and centers of religious study in the Old City Of Jerusalem, 12 were totally and deliberately destroyed. Those that remained standing were defaced, used for housing of both people and animals. Appeals were made to the United Nations and in the international community to declare the Old City to be an 'open city' and stop this destruction, but there was no response.<ref>[http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~steing/conflict/oped/jerufact.htm Jerusalem&nbsp;\u2013 1948, 1967, 2000: Setting the Record Straight] by Gerald M.

The [[Moroccan Quarter]] containing several hundred homes was demolished and its inhabitants expelled; thereafter a public plaza was built in its place adjoining the Western Wall. However, the [[Waqf]] (Islamic trust) was granted administration of the Temple Mount and thereafter Jewish prayer on the site was prohibited by both Israeli and Waqf authorities.\n\nMost Jews celebrated the event as a liberation of the city; a new Israeli holiday was created, [[Jerusalem Day]] (''Yom Yerushalayim''), and the most popular secular [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] song, \"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\" (''Yerushalayim shel zahav''), became popular in celebration. Many large state gatherings of the [[State of Israel]] take place at the Western Wall today, including the swearing-in of various Israel army officers units, national ceremonies such as memorial services for fallen Israeli soldiers on ''[[Yom Hazikaron]]'', huge celebrations on ''[[Yom Ha'atzmaut]]'' (Israel Independence Day), huge gatherings of tens of thousands on [[Jewish religious holidays]], and ongoing daily prayers by regular attendees. The Western Wall has become a major tourist destination spot.\n\nUnder Israeli control, members of all religions are largely granted access to their holy sites. The major exceptions being security limitations placed on some Arabs from the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] from accessing holy sites due to their inadmissibility to Jerusalem, as well as limitations on Jews from visiting the Temple Mount due to both politically motivated restrictions (where they are allowed to walk on the Mount in small groups, but are forbidden to pray or study while there) and religious edicts that forbid Jews from trespassing on what may be the site of the Holy of the Holies. Concerns have been raised about possible attacks on the al-Aqsa Mosque after a serious fire broke in the mosque in 1969 (started by [[Denis Michael Rohan]], an Australian fundamentalist Christian found by the court to be insane). Riots broke out following the opening of an exit in the [[Arab Quarter]] for the [[Western Wall Tunnel]] on the instructions of the Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], which prior Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace (stating \"it has waited for over 1000 years, it could wait a few more\").\n\nConversely, Israeli and other Jews have showed concerns over excavations being done by the Waqf on the Temple Mount that could harm Temple Relics, particularly excavations to the north of [[Solomon's Stables]] that were designed to create an [[emergency exit]] for them (having been pressured to do so by Israeli authorities).<ref>Temple Mount destruction stirred archaeologist to action, 8 February 2005 | by Michael McCormack, Baptist Press {{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID%3D20094 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726151231/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?Id=20094 |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some Jewish sources allege that the Waqf's excavations in Solomon's Stables also seriously harmed the [[Southern Wall]]; however an earthquake in 2004 that damaged the eastern wall could also be to blame.\n\nThe status of East Jerusalem remains a [[International law and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict#Jerusalem|highly controversial issue]].

The [[Amarna letters]] contain correspondence from [[Abdi-Heba]], headman<ref>Donald B. Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times,'' Princeton University Press, 1992 pp. 268, 270.</ref> of ''Urusalim'' and his [[suzerain]] [[Amenhotep III]].\n\nThe power of the Egyptians in the region began to decline in the 12th century BCE, during the [[Bronze Age collapse]]. The [[Battle of Djahy]] ([[Djahy]] being the Egyptian name for [[Canaan]]) in 1178 BCE between [[Ramesses III]] and the [[Sea Peoples]] marked the beginning of this decline. The gradual loss of a central power gave rise to independent kingdoms in the region. According to the Bible, Jerusalem at this time was known as [[Jebusite|Jebus]] and its independent [[Canaanites|Canaanite]] inhabitants at this time were known as [[Jebusites]].\n\n===Independent Israel and Judah (House of David) period===\n{{Main|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}{{Religious text primary|date=March 2012}}\n\nAccording to the Bible, the [[Israelite]] history of the city began in c. 1000 BCE, with [[King David]]'s sack of Jerusalem, following which Jerusalem became the [[City of David]] and capital of the [[United Kingdom of Israel]].<ref name=\"Slavik2001 p.60\"/> According to the [[Books of Samuel]], the [[Jebusites]] managed to resist attempts by the Israelites to capture the city, and by the time of King David were mocking such attempts, claiming that even the blind and lame could defeat the Israelite army. Nevertheless, the [[masoretic text]] for the [[Books of Samuel]] states that David managed to capture the city by stealth, sending his forces through a \"water shaft\" and attacking the city from the inside. Archaeologists now view this as implausible as the [[Gihon Spring|Gihon spring]] \u2013 the only known location from which water shafts lead into the city \u2013 is now known to have been heavily defended (and hence an attack via this route would have been obvious rather than secretive). The older{{Citation needed|reason=There is no prove that the Septuagint is older than the Massoretic Text, the latter being largely accepted by Judaism and Christianity as authentic|date=August 2017}} [[Septuagint]] text, however, suggests that rather than by a water shaft, David's forces defeated the [[Jebusites]] by using daggers rather than through the water tunnels coming through the [[Gihon spring]]. There was another king in Jerusalem, [[Araunah]], during, and possibly before, David's control of the city, according to the biblical narrative,<ref>2 Samuel 24:23, which literally has \"Araunah the King gave to the King [David]\".</ref> who was probably the Jebusite king of Jerusalem.<ref>[[Biblical Archaeology Review]], ''Reading David in Genesis'', Gary A. Rendsburg.</ref> The city, which at that point stood upon the [[Ophel]], was, according to the biblical account, expanded to the south, and declared by David to be the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. David also, according to the Books of Samuel, constructed an altar at the location of a threshing floor he had purchased from Araunah; a portion of biblical scholars view this as an attempt by the narrative's author to give an Israelite foundation to a pre-existing sanctuary.<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''.</ref>\n\nLater, according to the biblical narrative, King [[Solomon]] built a more substantive temple, the [[Temple of Solomon]], at a location which the [[Book of Chronicles]] equates with David's altar. The Temple became a major cultural centre in the region; eventually, particularly after religious reforms such as those of [[Hezekiah]] and of [[Josiah]], the Jerusalem temple became the main place of worship, at the expense of other, formerly powerful, ritual centres, such as [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] and [[Bethel]]. However, according to K. L. Noll, in Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: A Textbook on History and Religion, the Biblical account of the centralization of worship in Jerusalem is a fiction, although by the time of Josiah, the territory he ruled was so small that the Jerusalem temple became de facto the only shrine left.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/9701_10717.pdf | title=From Creation to Babel: Studies in Genesis 1\u201311 | first=Jesse | last=Rainbow | publisher=RBL | accessdate=22 April 2017 }}</ref> Solomon is also described as having created several other important building works at Jerusalem, including the construction of his palace, and the construction of the [[Millo]] (the identity of which is somewhat controversial).

In 925 BCE, the region was invaded by Egyptian Pharaoh [[Sheshonk I]] of the [[Third Intermediate Period]], who is possibly the same as [[Shishak]], the first Pharaoh mentioned in the [[Bible]] who [[Sack of Jerusalem (925 BC)|captured and pillaged Jerusalem]]. Around 75 years later, Jerusalem's forces were likely involved in an indecisive battle against the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian King]] [[Shalmaneser III]] in the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. According to the bible, [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah was allied to [[Ahab]] of the [[Northern Kingdom of Israel]] at this time.\n\nThe Bible records that shortly after this battle, Jerusalem was sacked by [[Philistine]]s, [[Arab]]s and [[Ethiopia]]ns, who looted King [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram's]] house, and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son [[Ahaziah of Judah|Jehoahaz]].\n\nTwo decades later, most of Canaan including Jerusalem was conquered by [[Hazael]] of [[Aram Damascus]]. According to the [[Bible]], [[Jehoash of Judah]] gave all of Jerusalem's treasures as a tribute, but [[Hazael]] proceeded to destroy \"all the princes of the people\" in the city. And half a century later, the city was sacked by [[Jehoash of Israel]], who destroyed the walls and took [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]] of Judah prisoner.\n\nBy the end of the ''First Temple Period'', Jerusalem was the sole acting religious shrine in the kingdom and a centre of regular pilgrimage; a fact which archaeologists generally view as being corroborated by the evidence,{{Citation needed|reason=\"generally view\" is quite broad|date=February 2011}} though there remained a more personal cult involving [[Asherah]] figures, which are found spread throughout the land right up to the end of this era.<ref name=\"Finkelstein\">{{cite book |author=Israel Finkelstein & Neil Asher Silberman |year=2002 |title=The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743223386}}</ref>\n\n===Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires period===\nJerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah for some 400 years. It had survived an [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|Assyrian siege in 701 BCE]] by [[Sennacherib]], unlike Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, that had fallen some twenty years previously. According to the Bible, this was a miraculous event in which an angel killed 185,000 men in Sennacherib's army. According to Sennacherib's own account preserved in the [[Taylor prism]], an inscription contemporary with the event, the king of Judah, Hezekiah, was \"shut up in the city like a caged bird\" and eventually persuaded Sennacherib to leave by sending him \"30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and diverse treasures, a rich and immense booty\".\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 597&nbsp;BCE led to the city being overcome by the [[Babylonia]]ns, who then took the young King [[Jehoiachin]] into [[Babylonian captivity]], together with most of the [[aristocracy]]. [[Zedekiah]], who had been placed on the throne by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586&nbsp;BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|recaptured the city]], killed Zedekiah's descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah's eyes so that that would be the last thing he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed [[Gedaliah]] son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by [[Baalis]], the king of [[Ammon]]. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.\n\n===Persian (Achaemenid) period===\n\n{{See also|Jerusalem during the Achaemenid period}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 250\n\n | image1 = YehudObverse.jpg\n | width1 = 228 | height1 = 221 \n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = YehudReverse.jpg\n | width2 = 228 | height2 = 212 \n | caption2 =\n\n | footer = Judean silver [[Yehud coinage|Yehud coin]] ([[ma'ah]]) from the [[History of the Jews in the Land of Israel#Fall of the Kingdom of Judah|Persian era]] with an Aramaic inscription \"\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\" (''Yehud'' \"[[Judea]]\") and a lily as a symbol of Jerusalem on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]\n}}\n\nAccording to the Bible, and perhaps corroborated by the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], after several decades of [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|captivity in Babylon]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of Babylonia, [[Cyrus&nbsp;II of Persia]] allowed the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild the Temple.

Roman legions under future emperor [[Titus]] reconquered and subsequently destroyed much of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;CE. Also the Second Temple was burnt and all that remained was the great external (retaining) walls supporting the esplanade on which the Temple had stood, a portion of which has become known as the [[Western Wall]]. Titus' victory is commemorated by the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome. Agrippa&nbsp;II died c. 94&nbsp;CE, which brought the [[Herodian dynasty]] to an end almost thirty years after the destruction of the Second Temple.

In 130, Hadrian visited the ruins of Jerusalem remaining after the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] of 66\u201373. He rebuilt the city, renaming it Aelia Capitolina in 135&nbsp;CE. Hadrian placed the city's main [[Roman Forum]] at the junction of the main [[Cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus|Decumanus]], now the location of the (smaller) [[Muristan]]. Hadrian built a large temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Capitolinus]], which later became the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].<ref>[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)</ref> He placed restrictions on some Jewish practices, which caused a [[Bar Kochba revolt|revolt]] led by [[Simon Bar Kokhba]]. Hadrian responded with overwhelming force, putting down the rebellion, killing as many as a half million Jews, and resettling the city as a Roman ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. Jews were forbidden to enter the city but for a single day of the year, [[Tisha B'Av]], (the Ninth of [[Ab (month)|Av]]), the [[Jewish fast day|fast day]] on which Jews mourn the destruction of both Temples. For the next 150 years, the city remained a relatively unimportant pagan Roman town.\n\n===Post-Crisis Roman and Early Byzantine Empire period===\nThe Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], however, rebuilt Jerusalem as a Christian center of worship, building the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in 335. Jerusalem had received special recognition in Canon&nbsp;VII of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], made a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to the city and claimed to have recovered the [[True Cross|''cross of Christ'']].

Sixty years later the [[Dome of the Rock]] was built, a structure enshrining a [[Foundation Stone|stone]] from which Muhammad is said to have ascended to heaven during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra]].

In 1071, Jerusalem was captured by the Turkish warlord [[Atsiz ibn Uvaq]], who seized most of Syria and Palestine as part of the expansion of the [[Seljuk Turks]] throughout the Middle East. As the Turks were staunch Sunnis, they were opposed not only to the Fatimids, but also to the numerous Shia Muslims, who saw themselves removed from dominance after a century of Fatimid rule. In 1176, riots between Sunnis and Shiites in Jerusalem led to a massacre of the latter. Although the Christians of the city were left unmolested, and allowed access to the Christian holy sites, the wars with Byzantium and the general instability in Syria impeded the arrival pilgrims from Europe. The Seljuks also forbade the repair of any church, despite the damages suffered in the recent turmoils. There does not appear to have been a significant Jewish community in the city at this time.\n\nIn 1086, the Seljuk emir of [[Damascus]], [[Tutush I]], appointed [[Artuk Bey]] governor of Jerusalem. Artuk died in 1091, and his sons [[S\u00f6kmen (Artuqid)|S\u00f6kmen]] and [[Ilghazi]] succeeded him. In August 1098, while the Seljuks were distracted by the arrival of the [[First Crusade]] in Syria, the Fatimids under vizier [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]] appeared before the city and laid siege to it. After six weeks, the Seljuk garrison capitulated and was allowed to leave for Damascus and Diyar Bakr. The Fatimid takeover was followed by the expulsion of most of the Sunnis, in which many of them were also killed.\n\n===Crusader period===\n{{main|History of Jerusalem during the Crusader period}}\n\nFatimid control of Jerusalem ended when it was captured by [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] in July 1099. The capture was accompanied by a [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|massacre]] of almost all of the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. Jerusalem became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was ambitiously rebuilt as a great Romanesque church, and Muslim shrines on the Temple Mount (the Dome of the Rock and the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]]) were converted for Christian purposes. It is during this period of Frankish occupation that the Military Orders of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Knights Templar]] have their beginnings. Both grew out of the need to protect and care for the great influx of pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem in the 12th century.\n\n===Ayyubid, Bahri Mamluk and Burji Mamluk period===\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted until 1291; however, Jerusalem itself was recaptured by [[Saladin]] in 1187 (see [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)]]), who permitted worship of all religions. According to [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm|Rabbi Elijah of Chelm]], [[German Jews]] lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century. The story is told that a German-speaking Jew saved the life of a young German man [[surname]]d Dolberger. Thus when the [[knight]]s of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to the German city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] to repay the favor.<ref>''Seder ha-Dorot'', 1878, p. 252.</ref> Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of [[Halakha|halakic]] questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.<ref>Epstein, in ''Monatsschrift'', vol. xlvii, p. 344; [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=242&letter=J#928 ''Jerusalem: Under the Arabs''].</ref>\n\n[[File:Tower of david jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[Tower of David]] (''Migdal David'') in Jerusalem today]]\n\nIn 1173 [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited Jerusalem. He described it as a small city full of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]s, [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Georgian people|Georgians]]. Two hundred Jews dwelt in a corner of the city under the [[Tower of David]]. In 1219 the walls of the city were razed by order of [[al-Mu'azzam]], the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[sultan of Damascus]]. This rendered Jerusalem defenseless and dealt a heavy blow to the city's status. The Ayyubids destroyed the walls in expectation of ceding the city to the Crusaders as part of a peace treaty. In 1229, by treaty with [[Egypt]]'s ruler [[al-Kamil]], Jerusalem came into the hands of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick&nbsp;II of Germany]]. In 1239, after a ten-year truce expired, he began to rebuild the walls; these were again demolished by [[an-Nasir Da'ud]], the emir of [[Kerak]], in the same year.\n\nIn 1243 Jerusalem came again into the power of the Christians, and the walls were repaired. The [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmian Empire]] took the city in 1244 and were in turn driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. In 1260 the Mongols under [[Hulagu Khan]] engaged in [[Mongol raids into Palestine|raids into Palestine]]. It is unclear if the Mongols were ever in Jerusalem, as it was not seen as a settlement of strategic importance at the time. However, there are reports that some of the Jews that were in Jerusalem temporarily fled to neighboring villages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn 1267 the Jewish Catalan sage [[Nahmanides]] travelled to Jerusalem. In the Old City he established the [[Ramban Synagogue]], the second oldest active synagogue in Jerusalem, after that of the [[Karaite Jews]] built about 300 years earlier. In the middle of the 13th century, Jerusalem was captured by the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]].\n\n==Early modern period==\n\nThe first provincial or superior of the Franciscan religious order, founded by [[Francis of Assisi]], was Brother Elia from [[Assisi]]. In the year 1219 the founder himself visited the region in order to preach the [[Gospel]] to the Muslims, seen as brothers and not enemies. The mission resulted in a meeting with the sultan of [[Egypt]], Malik al-Kamil, who was surprised by his unusual behaviour. The Franciscan Province of the East extended to Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, and the [[Holy Land]]. Before the taking over of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (on 18 May 1291), Franciscan friaries were present at Acre, [[Sidon]], [[Antioch]], [[Tripoli]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06674.html |title=Franciscans |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom [[Cyprus]], where they took refuge at the end of the [[Latin Kingdom]], the Franciscans started planning a return to Jerusalem, given the good political relations between the Christian governments and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] of Egypt.

With two papal bullae, Gratias Agimus and Nuper Carissimae, dated in [[Avignon]], 21 November 1342, [[Pope Clement VI]] approved and created the new entity which would be known as the Franciscan Custody of the [[Holy Land]] (Custodia Terrae Sanctae).<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.custodia.org/ |title=Custodia Terr\u00e6 Sanct\u00e6 |publisher=Custodia.org |accessdate=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025062624/http://www.custodia.org/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe friars, coming from any of the Order's provinces, under the jurisdiction of the father guardian (superior) of the monastery on Mount Zion, were present in Jerusalem, in the Cenacle, in the church of the [[Holy Sepulcher]], and in the Basilica of the Nativity at Bethlehem. Their principal activity was to ensure liturgical life in these Christian sanctuaries and to give spiritual assistance to the pilgrims coming from the West, to European merchants resident or passing through the main cities of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, and to have a direct and authorized relation with the [[Eastern Christianity]] Oriental communities.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary1\"/>\n\n[[File:View and Plan of Jerusalem Fac simile of a Woodout in the Liber Chronicarum Mundi large folio Nuremberg 1493.png|upright=1.2|thumb|View and Plan of Jerusalem.

The rule of Suleiman and subsequent Ottoman Sultans brought an age of \"religious peace\"; Jew, Christian and Muslim enjoyed freedom of religion and it was possible to find a synagogue, a church and a mosque on the same street.

During the course of the revolt, Jerusalem's residents administered their own affairs, engaging in virtual self-rule, until the central Ottoman authorities restored their control over the city.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Modern era==\n===Decline of the Ottoman Empire===\n{{see also|Departure from the walls}}\n\nIn the mid-19th century, with the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the city was a backwater, with a population that did not exceed 8,000. Nevertheless, it was, even then, an extremely heterogeneous city because of its significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The population was divided into four major communities&nbsp;\u2013 Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian&nbsp;\u2013 and the first three of these could be further divided into countless subgroups, based on precise religious affiliation or country of origin. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was meticulously partitioned between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Catholic]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]], and [[Ethiopian Church|Ethiopian]] churches. Tensions between the groups ran so deep that the keys to the shrine and its doors were safeguarded by a pair of 'neutral' Muslim families.\n\nAt the time, the communities were located mainly around their primary shrines. The Muslim community surrounded the [[Haram ash-Sharif]] or Temple Mount (northeast), the Christians lived mainly in the vicinity of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (northwest), the Jews lived mostly on the slope above the Western Wall (southeast), and the Armenians lived near the [[Zion Gate]] (southwest). In no way was this division exclusive, though it did form the basis of the four quarters during the British Mandate (1917\u20131948).\n\n[[File:Jerusalem1883.jpg|thumb|left|1883 map of Jerusalem]]\n\nSeveral changes with long-lasting effects on the city occurred in the mid-19th century: their implications can be felt today and lie at the root of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] over Jerusalem. The first of these was a trickle of Jewish immigrants from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The first such immigrants were [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]: some were elderly individuals, who came to die in Jerusalem and be buried on the Mount of Olives; others were students, who came with their families to await the coming of the [[Messiah]], adding new life to the local population. At the same time, European colonial powers began seeking toeholds in the city, hoping to expand their influence pending the imminent collapse of the Ottoman Empire. This was also an age of Christian religious revival, and many churches sent missionaries to [[proselytize]] among the Muslim and especially the Jewish populations, believing that this would speed the Second Coming of Christ. Finally, the combination of European colonialism and religious zeal was expressed in a new scientific interest in the biblical lands in general and Jerusalem in particular. Archeological and other expeditions made some spectacular finds, which increased interest in Jerusalem even more.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nBy the 1860s, the city, with an area of only one square kilometer, was already overcrowded. Thus began the construction of the New City, the part of Jerusalem outside of the city walls. Seeking new areas to stake their claims, the Russian Orthodox Church began constructing a complex, now known as the [[Russian Compound]], a few hundred meters from [[Jaffa Gate]]. The first attempt at residential settlement outside the walls of Jerusalem was undertaken by Jews, who built a small complex on the hill overlooking Zion Gate, across the [[Valley of Hinnom]]. This settlement, known as [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]], eventually flourished and set the precedent for other new communities to spring up to the west and north of the Old City. In time, as the communities grew and connected geographically, this became known as the New City.\n\nIn 1882, around 150 Jewish families arrived in Jerusalem from [[Yemen]]. Initially they were not accepted by the Jews of Jerusalem and lived in destitute conditions supported by the Christians of the Swedish-American colony, who called them [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]]ites.<ref name=\"Ariel\">{{Cite book| author = Tudor Parfitt | title = The road to redemption: the Jews of the Yemen, 1900\u20131950 | series = Brill's series in Jewish Studies, vol 17 | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | year = 1997 | page = 53}}</ref> In 1884, the Yemenites moved into [[Silwan]].\n\n{{wide image|Jerusalem panorama early twentieth century2.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of Jerusalem|Panorama of Jerusalem, early 20th century}}\n\n===British Mandate period===\n[[File:Ottoman surrender of Jerusalem restored.jpg|thumb|upright|The Ottoman surrender of Jerusalem to the British, 9 December 1917]]\n\nThe British were victorious over the Ottomans in the Middle East during [[World War&nbsp;I]] and victory in Palestine was a step towards dismemberment of that empire.

This continued under British rule, as the New City of Jerusalem grew outside the old city walls and the Old City of Jerusalem gradually emerged as little more than an impoverished older neighborhood. [[Sir Ronald Storrs]], the first British military governor of the city, issued a [[town planning]] order requiring new buildings in the city to be faced with [[sandstone]] and thus preserving some of the overall look of the city even as it grew.<ref name=elon>[[Amos Elon]], \"Jerusalem: City of Mirrors\". New York: Little, Brown 1989.</ref> During the 1930s, two important new institutions, the [[Hadassah|Hadassah Medical Center]] and [[Hebrew University]] were founded on Jerusalem's [[Mount Scopus]].\n\n[[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British rule]] marked, however, a period of growing unrest. Arab resentment at British rule and the influx of Jewish immigrants (by 1948 one in six Jews in Palestine lived in Jerusalem) boiled over in anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem in 1920, 1929, and the 1930s that caused significant damage and several deaths. The Jewish community organized self-defense forces in response to the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots]] and later disturbances; while other Jewish groups carried out bombings and attacks against the British, especially in response to suspected complicity with the Arabs and restrictions on immigration during World War&nbsp;II imposed by the [[White Paper of 1939]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The level of violence continued to escalate throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In July 1946 members of the underground Zionist group [[Irgun]] blew up a part of the [[King David Hotel]], where the British forces were temporarily located, an act which led to the [[King David Hotel bombing|death of 91 civilians]].\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved a [[1947 UN Partition Plan|plan]] which would partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. Each state would be composed of three major sections, linked by extraterritorial crossroads, plus an Arab enclave at [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]]. Expanded Jerusalem would fall under international control as a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|Corpus Separatum]].\n\n<center><gallery mode=nolines heights=150 widths=250>\nFile:Jewish legion hakotel 1917.jpg|[[Jewish Legion]] soldiers at the Western Wall after taking part in 1917 British conquest of Jerusalem\nFile:Image-Jerusalem Jaffa Gate-demolition.jpg|Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem during 1944 British demolition of recent construction obscuring the historic city walls\nFile:Jerusalem1947.png|Main residential areas of Jerusalem in 1947\nFile:Jerusalem boundary 1947.jpg|The Jerusalem boundary in 1947 and the proposed boundary of a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|Corpus Separatum]].\n</gallery></center>\n\n===Partition between Israel and Jordan===\n{{see also|Battle for Jerusalem}}\n[[File:1948-Jordanian artillery shelling Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Jordanian artillery shelling Jerusalem during the 1948 war]]\nAfter partition, the fight for Jerusalem escalated, with heavy casualties among both fighters and civilians on the British, Jewish, and Arab sides. By the end of March 1948, just before the British withdrawal, and with the British increasingly reluctant to intervene, the roads to Jerusalem were cut off by Arab irregulars, placing the Jewish population of the city under siege. The siege was eventually broken, though massacres of civilians occurred on both sides,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} before the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] began with the end of the British Mandate in May 1948.\n\nThe 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War led to massive displacement of Arab and Jewish populations. According to Benny Morris, due to mob and militia violence on both sides, 1,500 of the 3,500 (mostly ultra-Orthodox) Jews in the Old City evacuated to west Jerusalem as a unit.<ref name=autogenerated3>Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947\u20131949'', Revisited, Cambridge, 2004</ref> See also [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]].

Wasson]], was assassinated outside the YMCA building. Four months later the UN mediator, [[Folke Bernadotte|Count Bernadotte]], was also shot dead in the [[Katamon]] district of Jerusalem by the Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Stern Group]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Division between Jordan and Israel (1948\u20131967)==\n{{See also| Jordanian annexation of the West Bank |Islamization of East Jerusalem under Jordanian occupation}}\nThe [[United Nations]] proposed, in its 1947 plan for the [[partition of Palestine]], for Jerusalem to be a city under international administration. The city was to be completely surrounded by the Arab state, with only a highway to connect international Jerusalem to the Jewish state.\n\nFollowing the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was divided. The Western half of the New City became part of the newly formed state of Israel, while the eastern half, along with the Old City, was occupied by Jordan.\nAccording to David Guinn,\n<blockquote>Concerning Jewish holy sites, Jordan breached its commitment to appoint a committee to discuss, among other topics, free access of Jews to the holy sites under its jurisdiction, mainly in the Western Wall and the important Jewish cemetery on the [[Mount of Olives]], as provided in the Article 8.2 of the Cease Fire Agreement between it and Israel dated April 3, 1949. Jordan permitted the paving of new roads in the cemetery, and tombstones were used for paving in Jordanian army camps. The Cave of [[Simeon the Just|Shimon the Just]] became a stable.<ref name=autogenerated5>''Protecting Jerusalem's Holy Sites: A Strategy for Negotiating a Sacred Peace'' by David E. Guinn (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p.35 {{ISBN|0-521-86662-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Gerald M. Steinberg]], Jordan ransacked 57 ancient synagogues, libraries and centers of religious study in the Old City Of Jerusalem, 12 were totally and deliberately destroyed. Those that remained standing were defaced, used for housing of both people and animals. Appeals were made to the United Nations and in the international community to declare the Old City to be an 'open city' and stop this destruction, but there was no response.<ref>[http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~steing/conflict/oped/jerufact.htm Jerusalem&nbsp;\u2013 1948, 1967, 2000: Setting the Record Straight] by Gerald M.

Army chief chaplain rabbi Shlomo Goren, who is surrounded by IDF soldiers, blows the shofar in front of the western wall in Jerusalem. June 1967. D327-043.jpg|thumb|IDF chief rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] blows a shofar in front of the Western Wall after its capture during the Six-Day War]]\n[[East Jerusalem]] was captured by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. The [[Moroccan Quarter]] containing several hundred homes was demolished and its inhabitants expelled; thereafter a public plaza was built in its place adjoining the Western Wall. However, the [[Waqf]] (Islamic trust) was granted administration of the Temple Mount and thereafter Jewish prayer on the site was prohibited by both Israeli and Waqf authorities.\n\nMost Jews celebrated the event as a liberation of the city; a new Israeli holiday was created, [[Jerusalem Day]] (''Yom Yerushalayim''), and the most popular secular [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] song, \"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\" (''Yerushalayim shel zahav''), became popular in celebration. Many large state gatherings of the [[State of Israel]] take place at the Western Wall today, including the swearing-in of various Israel army officers units, national ceremonies such as memorial services for fallen Israeli soldiers on ''[[Yom Hazikaron]]'', huge celebrations on ''[[Yom Ha'atzmaut]]'' (Israel Independence Day), huge gatherings of tens of thousands on [[Jewish religious holidays]], and ongoing daily prayers by regular attendees. The Western Wall has become a major tourist destination spot.\n\nUnder Israeli control, members of all religions are largely granted access to their holy sites. The major exceptions being security limitations placed on some Arabs from the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] from accessing holy sites due to their inadmissibility to Jerusalem, as well as limitations on Jews from visiting the Temple Mount due to both politically motivated restrictions (where they are allowed to walk on the Mount in small groups, but are forbidden to pray or study while there) and religious edicts that forbid Jews from trespassing on what may be the site of the Holy of the Holies. Concerns have been raised about possible attacks on the al-Aqsa Mosque after a serious fire broke in the mosque in 1969 (started by [[Denis Michael Rohan]], an Australian fundamentalist Christian found by the court to be insane). Riots broke out following the opening of an exit in the [[Arab Quarter]] for the [[Western Wall Tunnel]] on the instructions of the Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], which prior Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace (stating \"it has waited for over 1000 years, it could wait a few more\").\n\nConversely, Israeli and other Jews have showed concerns over excavations being done by the Waqf on the Temple Mount that could harm Temple Relics, particularly excavations to the north of [[Solomon's Stables]] that were designed to create an [[emergency exit]] for them (having been pressured to do so by Israeli authorities).<ref>Temple Mount destruction stirred archaeologist to action, 8 February 2005 | by Michael McCormack, Baptist Press {{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID%3D20094 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726151231/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?Id=20094 |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some Jewish sources allege that the Waqf's excavations in Solomon's Stables also seriously harmed the [[Southern Wall]]; however an earthquake in 2004 that damaged the eastern wall could also be to blame.\n\nThe status of East Jerusalem remains a [[International law and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict#Jerusalem|highly controversial issue]]. The international community does not recognize the annexation of the eastern part of the city, and most countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. In May 2018 The United States and Guatemala moved the embassies to Jerusalem<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/after-us-embassy-move-to-jerusalem-more-countries-follow-its-lead.html|title=After US embassy makes controversial move to Jerusalem, more countries follow its lead|first=Ashley|last=Turner|date=17 May 2018|website=CNBC}}</ref> . The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] declared that the Knesset's 1980 \"[[Jerusalem Law]]\" declaring Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal and indivisible\" capital was \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". This resolution advised member states to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city as a punitive measure. The council has also condemned Israeli settlement in territories captured in 1967, including East Jerusalem (see UNSCR [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 452|452]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 465|465]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 471|741]]).\n\nSince Israel gained control over East Jerusalem in 1967, Jewish settler organizations have sought to establish a Jewish presence in neighborhoods such as [[Silwan]].<ref>[http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/3822b5e39951876a85256b6e0058a478/44ddc2496c28e0af052567f400544c98!OpenDocument \"Letter dated October 16, 1987, from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} UN General Assembly Security Council</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/0_index.shtml?x=591356|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908060351/http://www.mathaba.net/0_index.shtml?x=591356|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-08|title=Elad in Silwan: Settlers, Archaeologists and Dispossession|work=mathaba.net}}</ref> In the 1980s, ''Haaretz'' reports, the Housing Ministry \"then under Ariel Sharon, worked hard to seize control of property in the Old City and in the adjacent neighborhood of Silwan by declaring them absentee property.
