In the Second World War, they fought in the [[Battle of Britain]], and operated as a successful fighter-bomber unit for most of the war. In the 1960s, the squadron had their own aerobatic display team, 'The Firebirds', which consisted of nine [[English Electric Lightning]] F.1As, which participated at many airshows. From March 1976 to July 1992, '''No. 56 (Fighter) Squadron''' operated the [[McDonnell Douglas Phantom in UK service#F-4M Phantom FGR.2|McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2]], flying from [[RAF Wattisham]], [[Suffolk]], becoming the penultimate unit to fly the type. Until 18 April 2008, the squadron was the [[Royal Air Force Operational Conversion Units|Operational Conversion Unit]] for the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Panavia Tornado F.3]] at [[RAF Leuchars]], [[Fife]].\n\nAs of March 2020, the squadron is based at [[RAF Waddington]], [[Lincolnshire]] and serve as the Air Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Operational Evaluation Unit (AIR C2ISR OEU) for the RAF, a role they've held since 22 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/our-organisation/squadrons/56-squadron/ |title=56 Squadron |website=raf.mod.uk |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War===\nNo. 56 Squadron was formed on 8 June 1916 at [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|Gosport]], from members of [[No. 28 Squadron RAF|No. 28 Squadron]], as part of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).<ref name=\"AoA56\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Squadrons/Sqn056-60.htm |title=No 56 - 60 Squadron Histories |website=Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> On 14 July, the squadron relocated to [[London Colney]].<ref name=\"Shenley\">{{cite web |url=https://shenleyww1.wordpress.com/royal-flying-corps-at-shenley/ |title=Royal Flying Corps at Shenley |website=Shenley in WWI |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> No. 56 Squadron received its first aircraft, a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c]] on 7 August, which was followed by numerous other types.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.56sqnfirebirds.org.uk/squadronhistory.htm |title=56 Squadron History |website=56 Squadron \u2013 Home of the Firebirds |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Captain [[Albert Ball]] joined No. 56 Squadron as a Flight Commander in February 1917.<ref name=\"Shenley\"/> On 13 March 1917, the squadron became the first unit in the entire RFC to be equipped with the then brand new [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] fighter.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/>\n\n[[File:Albert Ball SE5a cockpit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ball]] in a No. 56 Squadron S.E.5 in April 1917.]]\n\nOn 31 March, No. 56 Squadron received orders to relocate to the RFC HQ at [[Saint-Omer]], [[France]].<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/> By 8 April, the entire Squadron had made the move from London Colney, with the pilots having their photograph in their S.E.5s taken before they left on the 7 April.<ref name=\"Shenley\"/> From Saint-Omer, the squadron relocated to Vert Galant on 20 April to support the [[Second Battle of Arras]] and flew their first mission on the 22 April. Its arrival at the front with the latest fighter, combined with the unusually high proportion of experienced pilots in its ranks, led to rumours among its German opponents that the squadron was an 'Anti-Richthofen Squadron', specifically dedicated to the removal of the [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]].<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/> The squadron did shoot down and kill Richthofen's nearest 1917 rival Leutnant [[Werner Voss]] in an epic dogfight, on 23 September 1917 by Lieutenant [[Arthur Rhys-Davids]]. Albert Ball scored No. 56 Squadron's first kill, his 32nd, on 23 April, when he shot down an [[Albatros D.III]].

In response to this, No. 56 Squadron was recalled back to England and based at [[RFC Bekesbourne]] on 21 June.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/>\n\nThe squadron participated in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], marking numerous victories throughout it. Captain [[James McCudden]], eventual highest scoring pilot of the squadron, joined on 13 August. Rhys-Davids made his final sortie on 27 October 1917, taking off for a routine patrol he chased after a group of Albatros fighters after which he was never seen again. The [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] credited [[Karl Gallwitz]] with the kill, word only reached the RFC on 29 December that Rhys-Davids had been killed.

In the Second World War, they fought in the [[Battle of Britain]], and operated as a successful fighter-bomber unit for most of the war. In the 1960s, the squadron had their own aerobatic display team, 'The Firebirds', which consisted of nine [[English Electric Lightning]] F.1As, which participated at many airshows. From March 1976 to July 1992, '''No. 56 (Fighter) Squadron''' operated the [[McDonnell Douglas Phantom in UK service#F-4M Phantom FGR.2|McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2]], flying from [[RAF Wattisham]], [[Suffolk]], becoming the penultimate unit to fly the type. Until 18 April 2008, the squadron was the [[Royal Air Force Operational Conversion Units|Operational Conversion Unit]] for the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Panavia Tornado F.3]] at [[RAF Leuchars]], [[Fife]].\n\nAs of March 2020, the squadron is based at [[RAF Waddington]], [[Lincolnshire]] and serve as the Air Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Operational Evaluation Unit (AIR C2ISR OEU) for the RAF, a role they've held since 22 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/our-organisation/squadrons/56-squadron/ |title=56 Squadron |website=raf.mod.uk |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War===\nNo. 56 Squadron was formed on 8 June 1916 at [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|Gosport]], from members of [[No. 28 Squadron RAF|No. 28 Squadron]], as part of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).<ref name=\"AoA56\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Squadrons/Sqn056-60.htm |title=No 56 - 60 Squadron Histories |website=Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> On 14 July, the squadron relocated to [[London Colney]].<ref name=\"Shenley\">{{cite web |url=https://shenleyww1.wordpress.com/royal-flying-corps-at-shenley/ |title=Royal Flying Corps at Shenley |website=Shenley in WWI |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> No. 56 Squadron received its first aircraft, a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c]] on 7 August, which was followed by numerous other types.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.56sqnfirebirds.org.uk/squadronhistory.htm |title=56 Squadron History |website=56 Squadron \u2013 Home of the Firebirds |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Captain [[Albert Ball]] joined No. 56 Squadron as a Flight Commander in February 1917.<ref name=\"Shenley\"/> On 13 March 1917, the squadron became the first unit in the entire RFC to be equipped with the then brand new [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] fighter.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/>\n\n[[File:Albert Ball SE5a cockpit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Ball]] in a No. 56 Squadron S.E.5 in April 1917.]]\n\nOn 31 March, No. 56 Squadron received orders to relocate to the RFC HQ at [[Saint-Omer]], [[France]].<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/> By 8 April, the entire Squadron had made the move from London Colney, with the pilots having their photograph in their S.E.5s taken before they left on the 7 April.<ref name=\"Shenley\"/> From Saint-Omer, the squadron relocated to Vert Galant on 20 April to support the [[Second Battle of Arras]] and flew their first mission on the 22 April. Its arrival at the front with the latest fighter, combined with the unusually high proportion of experienced pilots in its ranks, led to rumours among its German opponents that the squadron was an 'Anti-Richthofen Squadron', specifically dedicated to the removal of the [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]].<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/> The squadron did shoot down and kill Richthofen's nearest 1917 rival Leutnant [[Werner Voss]] in an epic dogfight, on 23 September 1917 by Lieutenant [[Arthur Rhys-Davids]]. Albert Ball scored No. 56 Squadron's first kill, his 32nd, on 23 April, when he shot down an [[Albatros D.III]]. The squadron suffered its first loss on 30 April when Lieutenant Maurice Alfred Kay was shot down. Ball himself was killed in action on 7 May, the same day as Lieutenant Roger Michael Chaworth-Musters.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/>\n\nNo. 56 Squadron was sent north to [[Estr\u00e9e-Blanche]] on 31 May 1917, to provide support for the upcoming [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. From May 1917, the [[German strategic bombing during World War I#1917|Germans began bombing London]] using their new [[Gotha G.IV]] bombers \u2013 with the first raid occurring on 25 May inflicting 290 casualties in London and Folkstone (due to diversion); the second raid was aborted and focused on Kent; the third was a daytime raid on 13 June in which there were 594 casualties, which went unanswered with the Germans losing no bombers. In response to this, No. 56 Squadron was recalled back to England and based at [[RFC Bekesbourne]] on 21 June.<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/>\n\nThe squadron participated in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], marking numerous victories throughout it. Captain [[James McCudden]], eventual highest scoring pilot of the squadron, joined on 13 August. Rhys-Davids made his final sortie on 27 October 1917, taking off for a routine patrol he chased after a group of Albatros fighters after which he was never seen again. The [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] credited [[Karl Gallwitz]] with the kill, word only reached the RFC on 29 December that Rhys-Davids had been killed. On 18 November, No. 56 Squadron was relocated to [[Lavi\u00e9ville]] in support of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].<ref name=\"56SqnHis\"/> In December 1917, McCudden scored 14 victories \u2013 including 4 on 23 December, a first for the RFC.<ref name=\"Revell 1987, pp. 26\u201327\">Revell 1987, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:McCudden fitted the fourblade propeller of his SE 5a 8491 G.jpg|thumb|left|[[James McCudden]]'s Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, sporting the propeller spinner from one of his victims, 1918.]]\n\nIn January 1918, the squadron moved to [[Baizieux]]. McCudden was sent back to England on 5 March, where he was promoted to Major and received the Victoria Cross, he died on 9 July in an accident while on his way to take command of [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|No. 60 Squadron]].

[[Nanda Devi]] is a Himalayan mountain in what was then the [[Garhwal District]] in northern India, just west of Nepal, and at one time it was thought to be the highest mountain in the world.\n\nNanda Devi is surrounded by a ring of mountains enclosing the [[Nanda Devi Sanctuary|Sanctuary]] which, despite decades of attempts, no one had been able to enter. In 1934 [[Eric Shipton]], [[Bill Tilman]] and their three accomplished Sherpas succeeded in finding a climbing route into the Sanctuary via the Rishi Ganga gorge. Then in 1936 Tilman and [[Noel Odell]], as part of an American\u2013British team, climbed to the  {{convert|7816|m|adj=on|order=flip}} summit making Nanda Devi the [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|highest mountain ever to have been climbed]] at that time.\n\nIt was only in 1950 that a higher summit was reached when [[Maurice Herzog]] and [[Louis Lachenal]] climbed [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna]]. Nanda Devi itself was climbed for the second time in 1964.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|pp=11, 43}}\n\n==Summary==\n\nExcept for the Rishi Ganga gorge to the west, Nanda Devi is encircled by a ring of mountains with no [[col]] lower than {{convert|18000|ft}}. This mountain chain surrounds and completely encloses the [[Nanda Devi Sanctuary]]. [[Tom Longstaff]] had reached an eastern col in 1905 and had been able to see into the Sanctuary but he did not try the formidable descent.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=170\u2013174}} The immensely deep and narrow gorge by which the Rishi Ganga river drains the Sanctuary had never been ascended despite many attempts. However, before the 1934 [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoon]], Shipton and Tilman along with three Sherpas who they regarded as co-climbers \u2013 [[Ang Tharkay]], Pasang and Kusang \u2013 became the first people to find a way through the gorge and to set foot in the Sanctuary in what has been described as \"the most exciting story in the whole saga of mountain discovery\".{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=14}}{{sfnp|Shipton|1936}}\n\nDuring their retreat from the Sanctuary for the duration of the monsoon, the 1934 expedition continued exploring by crossing the [[Badrinath]]\u2013[[Kedarnath]] watershed for the first time, a feat that was not repeated until 1998.<ref name=moran />{{sfnp|Shipton|1936}} After the monsoon they again ascended the Rishi Ganga gorge and climbed part way up Nanda Devi's southeast ridge thereby discovering the route to the summit that was to be used in 1936. They left the Sanctuary by traversing a col to the south and making a descent that had previously been thought impossible.{{sfnp|Shipton|1936}}\n\nIn 1936 Nanda Devi became the [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|highest mountain ever to have been climbed]] when a jointly-led American expedition, which eventually passed the leadership to Bill Tilman, reached its {{convert|7816|m|adj=on|order=flip}} summit<ref name=\"peaklist\">{{cite web|url=http://peaklist.org/WWlists/ultras/karakoram.html|title=High Asia I: The Karakoram, Pakistan Himalaya and India Himalaya (north of Nepal)|publisher=Peaklist.org|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070238/http://www.peaklist.org/WWlists/ultras/karakoram.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> by climbing the southeast ridge.

By 1820 the highest mountain to have been measured was Peak XIV in [[Garhwal Himalaya]] at {{convert|25669|ft}}.

The Garhwal area had been venerated by Buddhists until they were expelled by [[Adi Shankara]] in the 9th century [[Common Era|CE]] when their temples were adopted as Hindu while aspects of the two religions were merged. [[Badrinath Temple]] near the source of the [[Alaknanda River|Alaknanda Ganges]] has a style of architecture and a stone image of [[Vishnu]] that are characteristically Buddhist.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=32}} The local [[Uttarakhand Bhotiya|Bhotia people]] had originally come from Tibet and their traditional work was to transport goods over the mountain passes between India and Tibet. Garhwal was never conquered by the [[Mughal Empire]] of India but Nepalese [[Gurkha]]s had successfully invaded. The British annexation in 1815 had little impact on the local culture. So, a very relaxed form of Hinduism developed, one which closely coexisted with Buddhism. Buddhist prayer flags sometimes adorned the Hindu temples.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|pp=49-50}}\n\nThe four shrines of [[Chota Char Dham]] in Garhwal are very important for Hindu pilgrims because they are at four sources of the river Ganga. However, the source of the Rishi Ganga tributary is inaccessible. Nanda Devi, the Goddess of Bliss, lived on the top of the mountain that is named after her and which is where the [[Saptarishi|Seven Rishis]] were driven by the demons before they finally became seven stars in the sky.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=23}} Nanda Devi left her mountain to live with her husband [[Shiva]] on [[Mount Kailash]] in Tibet but once a year, in October, she returns and this is a time of celebration for pilgrims.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=58}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=John|title=One day as a Tiger|date=2014|publisher=Vertebrate Publishing|isbn=978-1-910240-08-3|page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Early mountaineering and exploration===\n\nNo real attempt had been made to cross the ring of mountains enclosing Nanda Devi until 1883. In that year [[William Woodman Graham|William Graham]], who was the first climber to visit Himalaya purely for sporting purposes, attempted to reach the basin inside the protecting ring, the so-called [[Nanda Devi Sanctuary]]. The Rishi Ganga river drains the Sanctuary though an extremely deep gorge and he attempted to ascend along this route. He found the lowest part of the gorge impassable. Then, after almost reaching the summit of [[Dunagiri (mountain)|Dunagiri]], and guided by local inhabitants, he took a route slightly north of the river and he was able to reach the gorge part way up. To the west of Nanda Devi the encircling ring becomes double with an inner ring enclosing the inner part of the Sanctuary and an outer part of the Sanctuary lying between the two ridges of the ring. By crossing the outer ring and avoiding the lower part of the gorge Graham had reached the outer part of the Sanctuary but he could not get any further.{{sfnp|Tilman|2014|loc=325\u2013338/2774}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Willett|first1=Maxine|title=Graham, William Woodman (1859-unknown)|url=http://www.mountain-heritage.org/entity.php?ID=215|website=Mountain Heritage Trust|publisher=Mountain Heritage Trust|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082354/http://www.mountain-heritage.org/entity.php?ID=215|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Badrinath Garhwal 1882 map.jpg|thumb|Survey of India map of Badrinath, 1882.

Shipton was in the party that reached the [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|highest summit to have been achieved]] \u2013 a {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} peak had never been climbed before. Subsequently the expedition explored the mountains around [[Badrinath]] in [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] which, because of the beautiful flora and dramatic scenery, Shipton described as \"by far the most enjoyable part of the expedition\".{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=137\u2013140}}\n\nAfter Shipton's very creditable performance on the large-scale [[1933 British Mount Everest expedition]], he and [[Lawrence Wager]] trekked back to [[Darjeeling]] separately from the rest of the party and this experience convinced him that small expeditions could be more enjoyable than large ones and, he suspected, more successful as well.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=152\u2013168}} Inspired by Longstaff and attracted by Garhwal and the unexplored Rishi Ganga gorge, Shipton decided to plan his own approach to the region.{{sfnp|Shipton|1935|p=304}}\n\n==Shipton and Tilman==\n\nBill Tilman was born in 1898. He did well at school but, in 1914 with the outbreak of the [[Great War]], he left to train for the [[Royal Artillery]]. At the age of 17 he was fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] where he was twice seriously wounded and was twice awarded the Military Cross. He fought and survived the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] and he was still less than 21 years old when the war was over.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=62\u201373}} As part of his demobilisation he was awarded a square mile of land in [[British East Africa]]. He was lucky with his allocation and he converted his patch of bush into a successful coffee plantation.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=103\u2013107}}\n\nEric Shipton was nine years younger. Born in [[Ceylon]] but educated in Britain, he became interested in mountaineering, particularly during a snowless skiing holiday in the Alps. He turned down an opportunity to go to Cambridge University and instead took a course in estate management which set him up to become an apprentice on a coffee estate near [[Nairobi]] and within reach of [[Mount Kenya]] where he developed his mountaineering skills. Reading of this in the newspapers, Tilman wrote asking for advice and this drew the two men into a climbing partnership.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=32\u201351, 74\u2013102, 111\u2013123}} So, in 1930, despite Tilman's almost complete lack of mountaineering experience, they succeeded in climbing Mount Kenya's west ridge for the first time and went on to make the first traverse of its two peaks, Batian and Neilion.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=127\u2013135}}\n\nBack in Britain following his 1932 Kamet expedition, Shipton advanced his plans to again explore the Garhwal region. His initial idea was for a lightweight expedition to explore the mountainous area between the [[Badrinath Temple|Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath Temple|Kedernath]] and [[Gangotri#Gangotri Temple|Gangotri]] shrines but Longstaff urged him to attempt to enter and map the Nanda Devi Sanctuary itself.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=173}} Noel Humphreys, his first choice for a climbing partner, was unavailable but then a letter arrived from Tilman who had decided to visit Britain by cycling across Africa from [[Uganda]] to [[French Cameroon]] using a map torn from a magazine, and then taking a steamer to his family home near [[Liverpool]].{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=150\u2013151}} Tilman's letter had suggested a fortnight's rock climbing in the [[Lake District]] to which Shipton replied by inviting him on a seven-month expedition to Himalaya. Tilman accepted by return of post. In 1969 Shipton wrote that, but for the serendipity of being able to be together at the right time, the course of both their lives would have been profoundly different.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=176}}\n\nShipton was a very gregarious, sociable person who was attractive to women. According to [[George Band]], \"Eric slung his ice axe beside many a memsahib's bed\".{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=47}} Tilman was taciturn and monkish and he avoided society, particularly that of women.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=179}}  Both men were tremendously strong and reliable.

This served as the basis for their own surveying which they saw as one of their main purposes. They traversed the Duraishi and Dibrughita high grazing areas<ref group=note>From the village of Lata the route goes to Lata Kharak, Dharansi Pass, Duraishi and Dibrughita all the time navigating by keeping an eye open for [[Dunagiri (mountain)|Dunagiri]].</ref> and descended to just below the confluence of the Rhamani and the Rishi rivers, halfway up the gorge and eight days march from Joshimath.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=190\u2013201}} Base camp was set up near the confluence of the two rivers and here the porters were paid off.

They also went to the northernmost part of the ring but while they were exploring the foothills of [[Changabang]] the weather deteriorated and the Sherpas effectively took the lead when both Europeans were ill. On 24 June the monsoon arrived and they started their retreat, urged on by the Sherpas. In heavy rain they descended the gorge to the Rhamani river in two days. This river had become torrential and they were forced upstream to where they found an easy crossing point and a route back to Dibrughita from where they raced back to civilisation. In a letter Shipton wrote of the Sanctuary \"There was a tremendous variety of birds and any amount of game \u2013 most of which can never have seen a man, and stared at us incredulously.

The team found a way over the watershed and, guided by the sight of [[Shivling (Garhwal Himalaya)|Shivling]], descended the Chaturangi Glacier<ref group=note>Shipton refers to the Chaturangi Glacier as \"'X' glacier\"</ref> to the snout of the [[Gangotri Glacier]] at Gaumukh. With insufficient food to include Gangotri on their itinerary, they returned to Badrinath via the Arwa valley.{{sfnp|Shipton|2014|loc=2062\u20132306/3254}}\n\n===Badrinath\u2013Kedarnath crossing===\n[[File:Shipton-Tilman 1934 Garhwal routes.svg|thumb|Sketch map of Badrinath \u2013 Gaukukh, and Badrinath \u2013 Kedernath routes]]\nThere was a legend of a high priest who used to hold services in the Badrinath and Kedernath temples both on the same day.

It took difficult route-finding and awkward ice climbing to reach the head of the glacier. Eventually they were able to see to the west of the divide to discover that they were at the head of the Kedarnath valley (as Tilman had predicted) and not the Gangotri Glacier (as Shipton had expected). Immediately they were faced by an ice precipice of hundreds of feet with ice pinnacles and crevasses. Shipton and Tilman felt they might have to turn back but the Sherpas were determined and eventually it was Ang Tharkay who found a route down, albeit a most difficult one.{{sfnp|Shipton|2014|loc=2311\u20132523/3254}}\n\nWhat they presumed would be a two-day trek to Kedarnath turned out to be a far more serious journey. There was a precipice of {{convert|2200|ft}}, scrub and jungle that had to be cut through, and rivers that were almost impossible to cross. Eventually, and after over a week, they reached villages where they could get food but when they reached the pilgrims' road to Kedarnath they decided there was no time to go north on the trail to the temple and they turned south instead, taking the pilgrim route back to Joshimath.{{sfnp|Shipton|2014|loc=2523\u20132850/3254}}\n\n===The Sanctuary revisited===\n[[File:Rishi Ganga gorge - Shipton-Tilman team climbing buttress.jpg|thumb|upright|Hauling loads below the \"Pisgah\" buttress in the Rishi Ganga gorge]]\nThey left Joshimath on 30 August with a group of porters they had hired locally, at [[Mana, India|Mana]]. So enthusiastic were the porters that thirteen accompanied the team up the Rishi Ganga gorge and into the Sanctuary itself.

It took two days to discover a route down the precipice and Ang Tharkay was the person who found the way that was at last successful. Descending the valley they reached the [[Pindar River]]. At last reaching Sameswar they were able to board a bus to [[Ranikhet]] and they went their separate ways at [[Bareilly]] with Shipton writing his book ''Nanda Devi'' on his six-week voyage home.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=234\u2013239}}{{sfnp|Shipton|1936}}\n\n==Mount Everest intervenes==\n\nThe [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s reception of Shipton's February 1935 Nanda Devi presentation{{sfnp|Shipton|1935}} was \"close to rapturous\" and of particular note was that the full cost of the entire expedition had been \u00a3287.{{refn|group=note|The [[1933 British Mount Everest expedition|1933 expedition]] and the [[1936 British Mount Everest expedition|1936 expedition]] to Mount Everest each cost over \u00a310,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Unsworth|first=Walt|title=Everest|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|date=1981|pages=163, 210|isbn=0713911085}}</ref>}}{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=241}} Shipton and Tilman were both lauded by the top brass of the RGS but there was no support for any immediate return to Nanda Devi because Tibet had just given permission for attempts on Mount Everest in 1935 and 1936.

[[Noel Odell]] and [[Peter Lloyd (mountaineer)|Peter Lloyd]] also agreed to be part of the British contingent. Loomis went to London to purchase equipment where he was advised that Nanda Devi might be a more achievable option. Tilman, however, personally favoured Kanchenjunga. The Americans changed the expedition's name from the \"Harvard Kanchenjunga Expedition\" to the \"British\u2013American Himalayan Expedition\".{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2010|p=192}} Later, in 1999, Houston wrote, \"It's hard to believe how na\u00efve and presumptuous we were ...

A few days later the entire party came together and they set off for the Sanctuary.

Pleased with progress, after supper Loomis produced a flask of apricot brandy he had kept hidden so everyone celebrated.

Tilman was chosen and, after delays caused by a blizzard, he decided on a summit team of Houston and Odell who, with the others in support, climbed to {{convert|23400|ft}} where they set up a precarious camp. The next day Houston and Odell climbed strongly but they realised they would not reach the summit that day so they retreated to their bivouac camp where Houston ate meat which had become contaminated so that he was unable to continue on the climb. Odell called down the mountain \"Charlie is ill\" but the American Carter who heard the shout, not well-attuned to Odell's posh English accent, misheard the message as \"Charlie is killed\".<ref group=note>Tilman wrote of \"Odell's familiar yodel, like a donkey braying.</ref> A very sorrowful party set off on the six-hour journey to retrieve the corpse with Tilman the only person taking his full climbing kit.

[[Nanda Devi]] is a Himalayan mountain in what was then the [[Garhwal District]] in northern India, just west of Nepal, and at one time it was thought to be the highest mountain in the world.\n\nNanda Devi is surrounded by a ring of mountains enclosing the [[Nanda Devi Sanctuary|Sanctuary]] which, despite decades of attempts, no one had been able to enter. In 1934 [[Eric Shipton]], [[Bill Tilman]] and their three accomplished Sherpas succeeded in finding a climbing route into the Sanctuary via the Rishi Ganga gorge. Then in 1936 Tilman and [[Noel Odell]], as part of an American\u2013British team, climbed to the  {{convert|7816|m|adj=on|order=flip}} summit making Nanda Devi the [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|highest mountain ever to have been climbed]] at that time.\n\nIt was only in 1950 that a higher summit was reached when [[Maurice Herzog]] and [[Louis Lachenal]] climbed [[Annapurna I Main|Annapurna]].

The Garhwal area had been venerated by Buddhists until they were expelled by [[Adi Shankara]] in the 9th century [[Common Era|CE]] when their temples were adopted as Hindu while aspects of the two religions were merged. [[Badrinath Temple]] near the source of the [[Alaknanda River|Alaknanda Ganges]] has a style of architecture and a stone image of [[Vishnu]] that are characteristically Buddhist.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=32}} The local [[Uttarakhand Bhotiya|Bhotia people]] had originally come from Tibet and their traditional work was to transport goods over the mountain passes between India and Tibet. Garhwal was never conquered by the [[Mughal Empire]] of India but Nepalese [[Gurkha]]s had successfully invaded. The British annexation in 1815 had little impact on the local culture. So, a very relaxed form of Hinduism developed, one which closely coexisted with Buddhism. Buddhist prayer flags sometimes adorned the Hindu temples.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|pp=49-50}}\n\nThe four shrines of [[Chota Char Dham]] in Garhwal are very important for Hindu pilgrims because they are at four sources of the river Ganga. However, the source of the Rishi Ganga tributary is inaccessible. Nanda Devi, the Goddess of Bliss, lived on the top of the mountain that is named after her and which is where the [[Saptarishi|Seven Rishis]] were driven by the demons before they finally became seven stars in the sky.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=23}} Nanda Devi left her mountain to live with her husband [[Shiva]] on [[Mount Kailash]] in Tibet but once a year, in October, she returns and this is a time of celebration for pilgrims.{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=58}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=John|title=One day as a Tiger|date=2014|publisher=Vertebrate Publishing|isbn=978-1-910240-08-3|page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Early mountaineering and exploration===\n\nNo real attempt had been made to cross the ring of mountains enclosing Nanda Devi until 1883. In that year [[William Woodman Graham|William Graham]], who was the first climber to visit Himalaya purely for sporting purposes, attempted to reach the basin inside the protecting ring, the so-called [[Nanda Devi Sanctuary]]. The Rishi Ganga river drains the Sanctuary though an extremely deep gorge and he attempted to ascend along this route. He found the lowest part of the gorge impassable. Then, after almost reaching the summit of [[Dunagiri (mountain)|Dunagiri]], and guided by local inhabitants, he took a route slightly north of the river and he was able to reach the gorge part way up. To the west of Nanda Devi the encircling ring becomes double with an inner ring enclosing the inner part of the Sanctuary and an outer part of the Sanctuary lying between the two ridges of the ring. By crossing the outer ring and avoiding the lower part of the gorge Graham had reached the outer part of the Sanctuary but he could not get any further.{{sfnp|Tilman|2014|loc=325\u2013338/2774}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Willett|first1=Maxine|title=Graham, William Woodman (1859-unknown)|url=http://www.mountain-heritage.org/entity.php?ID=215|website=Mountain Heritage Trust|publisher=Mountain Heritage Trust|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082354/http://www.mountain-heritage.org/entity.php?ID=215|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Badrinath Garhwal 1882 map.jpg|thumb|Survey of India map of Badrinath, 1882.

Shipton was in the party that reached the [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|highest summit to have been achieved]] \u2013 a {{convert|25000|ft|adj=on}} peak had never been climbed before. Subsequently the expedition explored the mountains around [[Badrinath]] in [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] which, because of the beautiful flora and dramatic scenery, Shipton described as \"by far the most enjoyable part of the expedition\".{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=137\u2013140}}\n\nAfter Shipton's very creditable performance on the large-scale [[1933 British Mount Everest expedition]], he and [[Lawrence Wager]] trekked back to [[Darjeeling]] separately from the rest of the party and this experience convinced him that small expeditions could be more enjoyable than large ones and, he suspected, more successful as well.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=152\u2013168}} Inspired by Longstaff and attracted by Garhwal and the unexplored Rishi Ganga gorge, Shipton decided to plan his own approach to the region.{{sfnp|Shipton|1935|p=304}}\n\n==Shipton and Tilman==\n\nBill Tilman was born in 1898. He did well at school but, in 1914 with the outbreak of the [[Great War]], he left to train for the [[Royal Artillery]]. At the age of 17 he was fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] where he was twice seriously wounded and was twice awarded the Military Cross. He fought and survived the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] and he was still less than 21 years old when the war was over.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=62\u201373}} As part of his demobilisation he was awarded a square mile of land in [[British East Africa]]. He was lucky with his allocation and he converted his patch of bush into a successful coffee plantation.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=103\u2013107}}\n\nEric Shipton was nine years younger. Born in [[Ceylon]] but educated in Britain, he became interested in mountaineering, particularly during a snowless skiing holiday in the Alps. He turned down an opportunity to go to Cambridge University and instead took a course in estate management which set him up to become an apprentice on a coffee estate near [[Nairobi]] and within reach of [[Mount Kenya]] where he developed his mountaineering skills. Reading of this in the newspapers, Tilman wrote asking for advice and this drew the two men into a climbing partnership.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=32\u201351, 74\u2013102, 111\u2013123}} So, in 1930, despite Tilman's almost complete lack of mountaineering experience, they succeeded in climbing Mount Kenya's west ridge for the first time and went on to make the first traverse of its two peaks, Batian and Neilion.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=127\u2013135}}\n\nBack in Britain following his 1932 Kamet expedition, Shipton advanced his plans to again explore the Garhwal region. His initial idea was for a lightweight expedition to explore the mountainous area between the [[Badrinath Temple|Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath Temple|Kedernath]] and [[Gangotri#Gangotri Temple|Gangotri]] shrines but Longstaff urged him to attempt to enter and map the Nanda Devi Sanctuary itself.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=173}} Noel Humphreys, his first choice for a climbing partner, was unavailable but then a letter arrived from Tilman who had decided to visit Britain by cycling across Africa from [[Uganda]] to [[French Cameroon]] using a map torn from a magazine, and then taking a steamer to his family home near [[Liverpool]].{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|pp=150\u2013151}} Tilman's letter had suggested a fortnight's rock climbing in the [[Lake District]] to which Shipton replied by inviting him on a seven-month expedition to Himalaya. Tilman accepted by return of post. In 1969 Shipton wrote that, but for the serendipity of being able to be together at the right time, the course of both their lives would have been profoundly different.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=176}}\n\nShipton was a very gregarious, sociable person who was attractive to women. According to [[George Band]], \"Eric slung his ice axe beside many a memsahib's bed\".{{sfnp|Thomson|2005|p=47}} Tilman was taciturn and monkish and he avoided society, particularly that of women.{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=179}}  Both men were tremendously strong and reliable.

They also went to the northernmost part of the ring but while they were exploring the foothills of [[Changabang]] the weather deteriorated and the Sherpas effectively took the lead when both Europeans were ill. On 24 June the monsoon arrived and they started their retreat, urged on by the Sherpas. In heavy rain they descended the gorge to the Rhamani river in two days. This river had become torrential and they were forced upstream to where they found an easy crossing point and a route back to Dibrughita from where they raced back to civilisation. In a letter Shipton wrote of the Sanctuary \"There was a tremendous variety of birds and any amount of game \u2013 most of which can never have seen a man, and stared at us incredulously.

With insufficient food to include Gangotri on their itinerary, they returned to Badrinath via the Arwa valley.{{sfnp|Shipton|2014|loc=2062\u20132306/3254}}\n\n===Badrinath\u2013Kedarnath crossing===\n[[File:Shipton-Tilman 1934 Garhwal routes.svg|thumb|Sketch map of Badrinath \u2013 Gaukukh, and Badrinath \u2013 Kedernath routes]]\nThere was a legend of a high priest who used to hold services in the Badrinath and Kedernath temples both on the same day.

It took difficult route-finding and awkward ice climbing to reach the head of the glacier. Eventually they were able to see to the west of the divide to discover that they were at the head of the Kedarnath valley (as Tilman had predicted) and not the Gangotri Glacier (as Shipton had expected). Immediately they were faced by an ice precipice of hundreds of feet with ice pinnacles and crevasses.

Pleased with progress, after supper Loomis produced a flask of apricot brandy he had kept hidden so everyone celebrated.

Students take the [[USMLE Step 1]] exam after the clerkship year (with the exception of MD/PhD students, who take it before starting their PhD work).  This allows students additional time to take electives, conduct research, or go on away rotations.  Other features of the curriculum include NYU3T (a joint program with the [[New York University College of Nursing]]) and PLACE (Patient-Based Longitudinal Ambulatory Care Experience).\n\nThe NYU School of Medicine also offers several 5-year joint degree programs, some of which can be optionally completed in 4 years.:<ref>[http://school.med.nyu.edu/studentsfaculty/student-affairs/masters-programs/about-masters-programs|work=Masters Program Information]</ref>\n* MD/MPA in Health Policy and Management (with the [[Robert F.

The 3-year program can only be applied to by students accepted into the 4 year stream. 3-year program students are guaranteed a residency placement in their specialty of choice at [[NYU Langone Medical Center]]. They complete their preclinical training at the same time as 4 year students, however they start clinical rotations 6 weeks earlier and also spend the summer after their first year doing a summer fellowship in the department of their specialty of choice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three-Year MD Pathway|url=https://www.med.nyu.edu/school/student-resources/medical-education/md-curriculum/three-year-md-degree|website=NYU|publisher=NYU|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Admissions==\n\nAdmission to NYU School of Medicine is among the most selective in the country. For the Class of 2019, NYU received 7,807 applications and interviewed 1027 applicants for a class of 132 medical students. The matriculating class had a median GPA of 3.87 and a MCAT score of 36, with 33% of the incoming class being underrepresented minorities.\n\n==Facilities==\n\nThe main NYU Langone Medical Center campus is located at the East River waterfront at 1st Ave. between 30th and 34th street.  It hosts the NYU School of Medicine, Tisch Hospital and the Howard A. [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]]. Other NYU Langone Medical Center facilities across the city include the Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, the NYU Cancer Center on 34th Street, and [[Woodhull Hospital]] in Brooklyn.  NYU Langone Medical Center also has a long-standing affiliation with the [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]], NYU's principal teaching hospital, of the [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation]], and with the Manhattan Veteran's Affairs Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/new-york-city-health-and-hospitals-corporation|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nMost recently, the NYU School of Medicine opened a new emergency simulation center at Bellevue Hospital in a joint effort with the [[City University of New York]].

The medical school merged with Bellevue Medical College in 1898 to form the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College. The present name was adopted in 1960.\n\nThe NYU School of Medicine is home to many key advancements in medical education.  In 1854, human dissection in New York was legalized due to efforts of the faculty. In 1884, the Carnegie Laboratory, the first facility in the U.S. devoted to teaching and research in bacteriology and pathology, was established at NYU. In 1932, the first department of forensic medicine in the U.S. was established at NYU. In 1941, NYU opened the first department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in the U.S. The Institute and Department of Environmental Medicine were established in 1964. In 1980, NYU professor [[Saul Krugman]], M.D., developed the first vaccine against hepatitis B.\n\nIn 1866, NYU professors produced a report for the Council of Hygiene and Public Health which led to establishment of New York City's Health Department. The same year, NYU opened the first outpatient clinic in the United States. In 1872, NYU Professor Steven Smith founded the American Public Health Association.   In 1899, NYU graduate [[Walter Reed]] discovered the mosquito transmission of [[yellow fever]].  The 1993 construction of the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine is the largest building project in history of NYU.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], NYU College of Medicine was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"nyu-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsonline.org/News/ep-history/notable-figures/victorparsonnet.cfm |title=Biography of Victor Parsonnet |publisher=Heart Rhythm Society |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |date=December 23, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210122313/http://www.hrsonline.org/News/ep-history/notable-figures/victorparsonnet.cfm |archivedate=December 10, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Mount Sinai School of Medicine===\nIn 1998, the Mount Sinai-NYU Health System was established when the NYU Medical System merged with Mount Sinai Hospitals. The joint organization included [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, [[Tisch Hospital]], [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]], Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, [[NYU Downtown Hospital]], and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]].

Students take the [[USMLE Step 1]] exam after the clerkship year (with the exception of MD/PhD students, who take it before starting their PhD work).  This allows students additional time to take electives, conduct research, or go on away rotations.  Other features of the curriculum include NYU3T (a joint program with the [[New York University College of Nursing]]) and PLACE (Patient-Based Longitudinal Ambulatory Care Experience).\n\nThe NYU School of Medicine also offers several 5-year joint degree programs, some of which can be optionally completed in 4 years.:<ref>[http://school.med.nyu.edu/studentsfaculty/student-affairs/masters-programs/about-masters-programs|work=Masters Program Information]</ref>\n* MD/MPA in Health Policy and Management (with the [[Robert F.

The 3-year program can only be applied to by students accepted into the 4 year stream. 3-year program students are guaranteed a residency placement in their specialty of choice at [[NYU Langone Medical Center]]. They complete their preclinical training at the same time as 4 year students, however they start clinical rotations 6 weeks earlier and also spend the summer after their first year doing a summer fellowship in the department of their specialty of choice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three-Year MD Pathway|url=https://www.med.nyu.edu/school/student-resources/medical-education/md-curriculum/three-year-md-degree|website=NYU|publisher=NYU|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Admissions==\n\nAdmission to NYU School of Medicine is among the most selective in the country. For the Class of 2019, NYU received 7,807 applications and interviewed 1027 applicants for a class of 132 medical students. The matriculating class had a median GPA of 3.87 and a MCAT score of 36, with 33% of the incoming class being underrepresented minorities.\n\n==Facilities==\n\nThe main NYU Langone Medical Center campus is located at the East River waterfront at 1st Ave. between 30th and 34th street.  It hosts the NYU School of Medicine, Tisch Hospital and the Howard A. [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]]. Other NYU Langone Medical Center facilities across the city include the Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, the NYU Cancer Center on 34th Street, and [[Woodhull Hospital]] in Brooklyn.  NYU Langone Medical Center also has a long-standing affiliation with the [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]], NYU's principal teaching hospital, of the [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation]], and with the Manhattan Veteran's Affairs Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/new-york-city-health-and-hospitals-corporation|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nMost recently, the NYU School of Medicine opened a new emergency simulation center at Bellevue Hospital in a joint effort with the [[City University of New York]].

The medical school merged with Bellevue Medical College in 1898 to form the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College. The present name was adopted in 1960.\n\nThe NYU School of Medicine is home to many key advancements in medical education.  In 1854, human dissection in New York was legalized due to efforts of the faculty. In 1884, the Carnegie Laboratory, the first facility in the U.S. devoted to teaching and research in bacteriology and pathology, was established at NYU. In 1932, the first department of forensic medicine in the U.S. was established at NYU. In 1941, NYU opened the first department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in the U.S. The Institute and Department of Environmental Medicine were established in 1964. In 1980, NYU professor [[Saul Krugman]], M.D., developed the first vaccine against hepatitis B.\n\nIn 1866, NYU professors produced a report for the Council of Hygiene and Public Health which led to establishment of New York City's Health Department. The same year, NYU opened the first outpatient clinic in the United States. In 1872, NYU Professor Steven Smith founded the American Public Health Association.   In 1899, NYU graduate [[Walter Reed]] discovered the mosquito transmission of [[yellow fever]].  The 1993 construction of the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine is the largest building project in history of NYU.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], NYU College of Medicine was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"nyu-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsonline.org/News/ep-history/notable-figures/victorparsonnet.cfm |title=Biography of Victor Parsonnet |publisher=Heart Rhythm Society |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |date=December 23, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210122313/http://www.hrsonline.org/News/ep-history/notable-figures/victorparsonnet.cfm |archivedate=December 10, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Mount Sinai School of Medicine===\nIn 1998, the Mount Sinai-NYU Health System was established when the NYU Medical System merged with Mount Sinai Hospitals. The joint organization included [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, [[Tisch Hospital]], [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]], Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, [[NYU Downtown Hospital]], and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]].

A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound.

From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016.<ref name=\"bmg.com\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/bmg-invests-ram-records.html| title=BMG Invests In Drum & Bass Powerhouse RAM | work=BMG | number= | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate= 18 August 2017}}</ref> Since then the genre has seen a significant growth in exposure. Drum and bass remains most popular in New Zealand although it has developed scenes all around the world, with countries like the UK, Russia, Estonia, Czech republic and the Netherlands having significant concentrations of DnB artists with the biggest Drum and bass festival [https://letitroll.cz/ Let It Roll ] being hosted in said Czech republic.Uk has the worst scene\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of drum and bass}}\n{{See also|Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore jungle}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to new genres in the [[rave]] scene including [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]], which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats, or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.\n\nBy 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called \"intelligent drum and bass\" gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\"\n\nDespite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and producing successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"SimonReynoldsOnTechstep\"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night article,

[[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\" />\n\n===Bass elements===\nThe genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n===Atmospheric elements===\nAtmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included \"light\" elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or \"dark\" elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.\n\n===Vocal and Melody elements===\nOld-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals, however, there are no good MCs in New Zealand.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drop===\nMany mixing points begin or end with a \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.\n\n==Live performance==\n\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\n===DJ performance===\n\nAlthough this practice has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs, and some events are specifically marketed as being MC-free.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n====Distributors (wholesale)====\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban Music Limited.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organise better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.\n\nAustria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo & Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body & Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include \"The Hive\" and \"Beat It\" held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, \"Vollkontakt\" at Fluc, \"Switch\" at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nIn Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as S\u00f3l F\u00fad, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.\n\n====South America====\nBrazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as \"[[sambass]]\", with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].\n\nIn Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.\n\nIn Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogot\u00e1 Project are two collectives that organise drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.\n\n===Media presence===\nToday, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nThe three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London. [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]] and [[Grooverider]] previously held a long-standing drum and bass show on Radio 1. Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref> as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal licence), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n=====Internet radio=====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]].

Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels.

Drum and bass remains most popular in New Zealand although it has developed scenes all around the world, with countries like the UK, Russia, Estonia, Czech republic and the Netherlands having significant concentrations of DnB artists with the biggest Drum and bass festival [https://letitroll.cz/ Let It Roll ] being hosted in said Czech republic.Uk has the worst scene\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of drum and bass}}\n{{See also|Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore jungle}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to new genres in the [[rave]] scene including [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]], which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats, or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.\n\nBy 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called \"intelligent drum and bass\" gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\"\n\nDespite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and producing successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"SimonReynoldsOnTechstep\"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night article,

One of his more famous basslines (Reese \u2013 \"Just Want Another Chance\", Incognito Records, 1988) was indeed sampled on Renegade's ''Terrorist'' and countless others since, being known simply as the 'Reese' bassline. He followed these up with equally influential (and bassline-heavy) tracks in the UK hardcore style as Tronik House in 1991\u20131992. Another Detroit artist who was important to the scene was [[Carl Craig]]. The sampled-up jazz break on Craig's ''Bug in the Bassbin'' was also influential on the newly emerging sound.

A more recent commonly used break is the \"Tramen\", which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (\"[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]\" or \"Samurai\" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011252/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archivedate = 24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\" />\n\n===Bass elements===\nThe genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n===Atmospheric elements===\nAtmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included \"light\" elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or \"dark\" elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.\n\n===Vocal and Melody elements===\nOld-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drop===\nMany mixing points begin or end with a \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.\n\n==Live performance==\n\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\n===DJ performance===\n\nAlthough this practice has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs, and some events are specifically marketed as being MC-free.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n====Distributors (wholesale)====\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban Music Limited.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States.<ref>\"Drum & Bass Keeps The Beat\", ''Boston Globe'', 6 February 2003.</ref>\n\n====Continental Europe====\nDnB is popular in continental [[Europe]]. The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organise better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.\n\nAustria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo & Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body & Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include \"The Hive\" and \"Beat It\" held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, \"Vollkontakt\" at Fluc, \"Switch\" at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nIn Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as S\u00f3l F\u00fad, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.\n\n====South America====\nBrazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as \"[[sambass]]\", with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].\n\nIn Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.\n\nIn Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogot\u00e1 Project are two collectives that organise drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.\n\n===Media presence===\nToday, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nThe three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London.

Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref> as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal licence), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n=====Internet radio=====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kmag.co.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum & Bass|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|date=26 September 2014|website=K Mag|access-date=}}</ref> The leading Drum & Bass radio Station is now Denver's [https://dnbradio.com DnB Radio], established in 2003 by M.
