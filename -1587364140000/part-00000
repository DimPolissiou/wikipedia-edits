Both need supplies, and select numbers from each side and intend to get them. The Autobots weren't looking for a fight with the Decepticons, but they get one out in space anyway. When the Decepticons board the Autobots' ship it takes a beating and [[Ancient astronauts|crashes onto Primitive Earth]] and knocks everyone unconscious. Four million years later, in 1984, a volcano eruption causes a probe to give them all new forms which come from vehicles in the surrounding area.

Still, two humans may not make a difference. The long dormancy has merely delayed Megatron and the Decepticons' ambitions, and they prove increasingly proficient in making up for lost time.

The Autobots use Ravage and some holograms in an attempt to lure the Decepticons into a final defeat. Ravage escapes informing [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] proves even sneakier seeing through Optimus' ruse and keeping them distracted from interfering in his own plans.

The new space bridge could do that, but it has problems like possibly being fatal to whoever tries to go through it. Finding where the Decepticons are hiding, Bumblebee and Spike discover what they are doing  only they don't have a chance to warn Optimus. The Decepticons instead have nasty plans for them.

Naturally, only the Autobots benefit from his 'command' style. This also gives Bumblebee and Spike time to relax with Chip Chase. They end up getting involved in a scientist's new [[anti-matter]] experiments. Megatron is back and again in charge of the Decepticons.

Coincidentally, nearby dinosaur fossils provide the necessary means. Soon enough, Wheeljack unveils Grimlock, Slag and Sludge. Their poor intelligence and great strength make for an uncomfortable combination. Optimus sees all of this as a mistake shutting down the Dinobots before they can harm themselves or anyone else.

In truth, the Decepticons put one over on them to leave their base vulnerable and kidnap Sparkplug. Dr. Arkeville enslaves Sparkplug for Megatron with a hypno-chip as a test of the device. It works and more humans will soon follow. Megatron has a dangerous new scheme in the works, and it includes a new space bridge. As for Sparkplug, it is decided that he can better serve Megatron when among the Autobots, ultimately making them vulnerable to a new attack.\n\n''Note'': This episode and its other 2 parts have events similar to ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''.\n\n |LineColor = 4d5180\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = The Ultimate Doom: Search (Part 2)\n |WrittenBy = ''Story:'' Dick Robbins, Bryce Malek, Douglas Booth, and Earl Kress<br />''Teleplay:'' Earl Kress\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1984|11|10}}\n |ProdCode = 700-09\n |Aux4 = 9\n |ShortSummary = Cybertron's nearby presence has [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|sent Earth and everyone on it into chaos]]. The Autobots and the Dinobots have their hands full trying to protect innocents and themselves from every possible natural disaster. Undoing what Megatron has done is a major priority, but so is rescuing Sparkplug. He is currently a Decepticon prisoner on Cybertron, and the Autobots aren't about to hang him out to dry.

However, the only chance of disabling the hypno-chips can be found there. Wheeljack quickly gets to work on that in his laboratory. Sparkplug is soon free, but numerous others aren't so lucky at the moment. Meanwhile, Megatron has nearly succeeded and is preparing the final stages of his energy plan.

Naturally, Megatron wants that advantage to be his instead. That doesn't prove very difficult to do, so the Autobots are soon facing the battle fury of [[Grimlock]], Slag and Sludge.

The brilliant, frozen Skyfire awaits, and it turns out he has been there for millions of years. It also turns out that he and Starscream shared something of a friendship in the past, something he hasn't forgotten. Now, the Autobots face Skyfire and the results aren't pretty.

However, rather than simply just providing raw numbers, they serve a greater purpose for Megatron. Their construction ingenuity ultimately gives Megatron every unique ability his team possesses. Of course, Optimus Prime is his primary target and in official combat. Per the terms, the loser must take his team off Earth forever.

Both sides become aware of it and the Decepticons reach it first. It can power a weapon destructive enough to eliminate the Autobots and decide the fate of Earth once and for all.

They certainly give the Autobots and the Decepticons good reason to take notice. The Insecticons have more in common with the latter than the former. These collective enemies don't scare the Autobots into submission, but bravery is hardly enough.

To save his son's life, Sparkplug helps the Autobots transfer Spike's mind to the body of an experimental robot called Autobot X while the doctors at the hospital work on repairing Spike's real body. The experiment works like a charm and Spike's mind is in Autobot X, temporarily becoming Autobot Spike.

The effects may only be temporary, but the Immobilizer lives up to its name against any Transformer. Little time passes before the Decepticons learn about it. A new friend to the Autobots Carly unwittingly helps them. Now, the soon-modified Immobilizer gives the Decepticons the means to end the war once and for all.

The latest instance shows Optimus and the other Autobots just how much this needs to change. Some serious training should clear this up, but they need a place where no one else will get caught in the middle. A new island seems to fit the bill, but the Dinobots won't be alone there.

As bad as that is for everything on the island, the rest of the world suffers even more. Somehow, various temporal displacements occur and all sorts of things emerge.

Now, Gears has one heck of a sunny disposition no matter who he is around. Meanwhile, the Decepticons have the final component for the space needle.

The film features several grand battles in which a handful of major characters meet their end.\n\nThe story takes place in 2005, twenty years after the events of the TV series' second season and serves as a bridge to the third season.

[[Optimus Prime]] dies following a battle with [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]].

Both need supplies, and select numbers from each side and intend to get them. The Autobots weren't looking for a fight with the Decepticons, but they get one out in space anyway. When the Decepticons board the Autobots' ship it takes a beating and [[Ancient astronauts|crashes onto Primitive Earth]] and knocks everyone unconscious. Four million years later, in 1984, a volcano eruption causes a probe to give them all new forms which come from vehicles in the surrounding area.

Still, two humans may not make a difference. The long dormancy has merely delayed Megatron and the Decepticons' ambitions, and they prove increasingly proficient in making up for lost time.

The Autobots use Ravage and some holograms in an attempt to lure the Decepticons into a final defeat. [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] escapes informing [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] proves even sneakier seeing through Optimus' ruse and keeping them distracted from interfering in his own plans.

Finding where the Decepticons are hiding, Bumblebee and Spike discover what they are doing  only they don't have a chance to warn Optimus. The Decepticons instead have nasty plans for them.

Naturally, only the Autobots benefit from his 'command' style. This also gives Bumblebee and Spike time to relax with Chip Chase. They end up getting involved in a scientist's new [[anti-matter]] experiments. Megatron is back and again in charge of the Decepticons.

However, rather than simply just providing raw numbers, they serve a greater purpose for Megatron. Their construction ingenuity ultimately gives Megatron every unique ability his team possesses.

They certainly give the Autobots and the Decepticons good reason to take notice. The Insecticons have more in common with the latter than the former.

''The Transformers'' continued in Japan as ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'' with 35 new episodes,  however, it ignores the events of \"The Rebirth\" and is set in a different continuity. A fifth season was aired in the United States but consisted entirely of re-runs of previous episodes being told as stories by Powermaster [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Generation 2 ==\n{{Main|Transformers: Generation 2}}\nGeneration 2 episodes were all taken from the [[The Transformers (TV series)|Generation 1 television series]] which had been previously produced, but with added effects and editing.
