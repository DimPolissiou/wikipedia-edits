It was released as a [[double album]] on October 28, 2013, in Canada by Sonovox Records and in the United States by [[Merge Records]]. The album was recorded in multiple studios and was co-produced by [[LCD Soundsystem]] frontman [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]], regular Arcade Fire producer [[Markus Dravs]], and the band themselves.\n\nInfluenced by Haitian [[rara]] music, the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', and [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s essay \"[[Two Ages]]\",<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/win-butler-reveals-secret-influences-behind-arcade-fires-reflektor-20131022 |title=Win Butler Reveals Secret Influences Behind Arcade Fire's 'Reflektor'|first=Patrick |last=Doyle |work=rollingstone.com |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> ''Reflektor'''s release was preceded by a [[guerrilla marketing]] campaign inspired by [[veve]] drawings and the release of the [[Reflektor (song)|title track]] as a limited edition single credited to the fictional band ''The Reflektors'' on September 9, 2013. Upon its release, ''Reflektor'' received positive reviews from music critics and had a successful commercial performance. The album was recognized as one of The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far, a list published by ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' in August 2014.<ref name=\"pitchfork.com\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9465-the-top-100-albums-of-2010-2014/ |title=The Top 100 Albums of 2010\u20132014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe album's origins stem from a trip that both vocalist/guitarist [[Win Butler]] and multi-instrumentalist [[R\u00e9gine Chassagne]] took to her family's home country of [[Haiti]]. Butler said: \"Going to Haiti for the first time with R\u00e9gine was the beginning of a major change in the way that I thought about the world. Usually, I think you have most of your musical influences locked down by the time you're 16. There was a band I [feel] changed me musically, just really opened me up to this huge, vast amount of culture and influence I hadn't been exposed to before, which was really life-changing.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> Inspired by the country's [[rara]] music, Butler and Chassagne incorporated elements of this sound into the band's new material, alongside [[Jamaica]]n influences. Butler stated, \"I mean, it's not like our band trying to play Haitian music. I just felt like we were opened up to a new influence. [[Bob Marley]] probably felt the same way the first time he heard [[Curtis Mayfield]].\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> According to the band's manager Scott Rodger, the album cost $1.6 million to make.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-unforgettable-fire-can-arcade-fire-be-the-worlds-biggest-band-20140116|title=Can Arcade Fire Be the World's Biggest Band?|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nRecording in [[Louisiana]], the band began work on ''Reflektor'' in 2011, and subsequently moved to [[Jamaica]] the following year with producer [[Markus Dravs]].<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> Working on roughly sixty song ideas, the band wrote and recorded in an abandoned [[castle]], named Trident: \"The castle was built in 1979, or something, by this eccentric Jamaican dude who just wanted to hang out with royalty. And it kind of worked. After about five years he couldn't afford to pay the bill, so it had been sitting empty for many years. I met a dude who was planning on turning it into a hotel, so we just rented it off him for cheap and there was nothing in there. We brought in some beds and a piano and some gear.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> The album was mostly recorded on [[analog tape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiofreecanuckistan.blogspot.ca/2013/10/arcade-fires-reflektor.html|title=Arcade Fire's Reflektor|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, the band also began working with producer and [[LCD Soundsystem]] frontman [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]], whom the band had been wanting to work with for over six years. Butler: \"LCD Soundsystem to me is like [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and the [[B-52's]] and we deeply share a lot of those influences, and we did completely different things with it. [[R\u00e9gine Chassagne|R\u00e9gine]] is kind of the person who dances. At any given minute, if you can get R\u00e9gine to dance, you're kind of on the right track, so I think we just wanted to make a record that R\u00e9gine could dance to.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nRegarding the band's decision to record a [[double album]], Win Butler stated, \"The record is really long. We intended to make a short record and we ended up with 18 songs that were all between six and eight minutes and we were like, 'Uh oh, I think we screwed up making a short record.' Splitting it over the two halves enables you to get into the different worlds of the records.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> According to Butler, 50 or 60 songs were written for the album.<ref name=\"Phillips, Amy\">{{cite web | author = Phillips, Amy| date = September 10, 2013| url = http://pitchfork.com/news/52234-arcade-fires-win-butler-offers-reflektor-details|title = Arcade Fire's Win Butler Offers Reflektor Details| publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]]| accessdate = November 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and composition==\n''Reflektor'' is an [[art rock]]<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/10402764/Arcade-Fire-Reflektor-album-review.html | title=Arcade Fire, Reflektor, album review | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=October 24, 2013 | accessdate=October 28, 2013 | author=McCormick, Neil | location=London}}</ref> and [[dance-rock]] album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-albums-of-2013-20131202/arcade-fire-reflektor-19691231|title=50 Best Albums of 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref> Primary lyricist [[Win Butler]] notes that the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'' inspired his lyrics on the album, in particular its themes of [[Solitude|isolation]] and [[death]]: \"''Black Orpheus'' is one of my favorite films of all time, which is set in Carnival in [[Brazil]]. The [[Orpheus]] myth is the original [[love triangle]], [[Romeo and Juliet]] kind of story. Lyrically, it's not literally about my life. I feel like I'm kind of a bit of a sponge in a way. Like, if people around me are going through things, I find it very hard not to be empathetic.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> Also influential to the album's lyrical content is an essay by Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], entitled \"[[Two Ages]]\". Butler states, \"[It's] about the reflective age. This is like in 1846, and it sounds like he's talking about modern times. He's talking about the [[news media|press]] and alienation, and you kind of read it and you're like, 'Dude, you have no idea how insane it's gonna get.'\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nThe album tracks, \"Here Comes the Night Time\" and \"Here Comes the Night Time II\", each appear on the album's respective halves, with Butler noting, \"The second one was actually written first and it almost starts the second half of the record \u2013 kind of like after the [[Haitian Carnival|[Haitian] Carnival]]. Both of them are very much influenced by when the sun is just starting to go down in [[Port au Prince]], and it's really intense because most of the city doesn't have [[electricity]] so everyone is just racing to get home before dark.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> The first of the two tracks references [[missionaries]], in part: \"The absurdity that you can go to a place like Haiti and teach people something about [[God]]. Like, the opposite really seems to be true, in my experience.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nThe track \"Supersymmetry\" was originally written for the film ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'', which the band was composing simultaneously while working on ''Reflektor''.

It was released as a [[double album]] on October 28, 2013, in Canada by Sonovox Records and in the United States by [[Merge Records]]. The album was recorded in multiple studios and was co-produced by [[LCD Soundsystem]] frontman [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]], regular Arcade Fire producer [[Markus Dravs]], and the band themselves.\n\nInfluenced by Haitian [[rara]] music, the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', and [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s essay \"[[Two Ages]]\",<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/win-butler-reveals-secret-influences-behind-arcade-fires-reflektor-20131022 |title=Win Butler Reveals Secret Influences Behind Arcade Fire's 'Reflektor'|first=Patrick |last=Doyle |work=rollingstone.com |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> ''Reflektor'''s release was preceded by a [[guerrilla marketing]] campaign inspired by [[veve]] drawings and the release of the [[Reflektor (song)|title track]] as a limited edition single credited to the fictional band ''The Reflektors'' on September 9, 2013. Upon its release, ''Reflektor'' received positive reviews from music critics and had a successful commercial performance. The album was recognized as one of The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far, a list published by ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' in August 2014.<ref name=\"pitchfork.com\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9465-the-top-100-albums-of-2010-2014/ |title=The Top 100 Albums of 2010\u20132014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe album's origins stem from a trip that both vocalist/guitarist [[Win Butler]] and multi-instrumentalist [[R\u00e9gine Chassagne]] took to her family's home country of [[Haiti]]. Butler said: \"Going to Haiti for the first time with R\u00e9gine was the beginning of a major change in the way that I thought about the world. Usually, I think you have most of your musical influences locked down by the time you're 16. There was a band I [feel] changed me musically, just really opened me up to this huge, vast amount of culture and influence I hadn't been exposed to before, which was really life-changing.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> Inspired by the country's [[rara]] music, Butler and Chassagne incorporated elements of this sound into the band's new material, alongside [[Jamaica]]n influences. Butler stated, \"I mean, it's not like our band trying to play Haitian music. I just felt like we were opened up to a new influence. [[Bob Marley]] probably felt the same way the first time he heard [[Curtis Mayfield]].\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> According to the band's manager Scott Rodger, the album cost $1.6 million to make.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-unforgettable-fire-can-arcade-fire-be-the-worlds-biggest-band-20140116|title=Can Arcade Fire Be the World's Biggest Band?|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nRecording in [[Louisiana]], the band began work on ''Reflektor'' in 2011, and subsequently moved to [[Jamaica]] the following year with producer [[Markus Dravs]].<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> Working on roughly sixty song ideas, the band wrote and recorded in an abandoned [[castle]], named Trident: \"The castle was built in 1979, or something, by this eccentric Jamaican dude who just wanted to hang out with royalty. And it kind of worked. After about five years he couldn't afford to pay the bill, so it had been sitting empty for many years. I met a dude who was planning on turning it into a hotel, so we just rented it off him for cheap and there was nothing in there. We brought in some beds and a piano and some gear.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> The album was mostly recorded on [[analog tape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiofreecanuckistan.blogspot.ca/2013/10/arcade-fires-reflektor.html|title=Arcade Fire's Reflektor|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, the band also began working with producer and [[LCD Soundsystem]] frontman [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]], whom the band had been wanting to work with for over six years. Butler: \"LCD Soundsystem to me is like [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and the [[B-52's]] and we deeply share a lot of those influences, and we did completely different things with it. [[R\u00e9gine Chassagne|R\u00e9gine]] is kind of the person who dances. At any given minute, if you can get R\u00e9gine to dance, you're kind of on the right track, so I think we just wanted to make a record that R\u00e9gine could dance to.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nRegarding the band's decision to record a [[double album]], Win Butler stated, \"The record is really long. We intended to make a short record and we ended up with 18 songs that were all between six and eight minutes and we were like, 'Uh oh, I think we screwed up making a short record.' Splitting it over the two halves enables you to get into the different worlds of the records.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> According to Butler, 50 or 60 songs were written for the album.<ref name=\"Phillips, Amy\">{{cite web | author = Phillips, Amy| date = September 10, 2013| url = http://pitchfork.com/news/52234-arcade-fires-win-butler-offers-reflektor-details|title = Arcade Fire's Win Butler Offers Reflektor Details| publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]]| accessdate = November 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and composition==\n''Reflektor'' is an [[art rock]]<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/10402764/Arcade-Fire-Reflektor-album-review.html | title=Arcade Fire, Reflektor, album review | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=October 24, 2013 | accessdate=October 28, 2013 | author=McCormick, Neil | location=London}}</ref> and [[dance-rock]] album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-albums-of-2013-20131202/arcade-fire-reflektor-19691231|title=50 Best Albums of 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref> Primary lyricist [[Win Butler]] notes that the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'' inspired his lyrics on the album, in particular its themes of [[Solitude|isolation]] and [[death]]: \"''Black Orpheus'' is one of my favorite films of all time, which is set in Carnival in [[Brazil]]. The [[Orpheus]] myth is the original [[love triangle]], [[Romeo and Juliet]] kind of story. Lyrically, it's not literally about my life. I feel like I'm kind of a bit of a sponge in a way. Like, if people around me are going through things, I find it very hard not to be empathetic.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> Also influential to the album's lyrical content is an essay by Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], entitled \"[[Two Ages]]\". Butler states, \"[It's] about the reflective age. This is like in 1846, and it sounds like he's talking about modern times. He's talking about the [[news media|press]] and alienation, and you kind of read it and you're like, 'Dude, you have no idea how insane it's gonna get.'\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nThe album tracks, \"Here Comes the Night Time\" and \"Here Comes the Night Time II\", each appear on the album's respective halves, with Butler noting, \"The second one was actually written first and it almost starts the second half of the record \u2013 kind of like after the [[Haitian Carnival|[Haitian] Carnival]]. Both of them are very much influenced by when the sun is just starting to go down in [[Port au Prince]], and it's really intense because most of the city doesn't have [[electricity]] so everyone is just racing to get home before dark.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/> The first of the two tracks references [[missionaries]], in part: \"The absurdity that you can go to a place like Haiti and teach people something about [[God]]. Like, the opposite really seems to be true, in my experience.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nThe track \"Supersymmetry\" was originally written for the film ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'', which the band was composing simultaneously while working on ''Reflektor''. A different version of the song appears during the film's end credits.
