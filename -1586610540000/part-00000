This test detects only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 and is used to confirm very recent or active infections.\n\nDetection of antibodies ([[serology]]) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance. Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were minor or who were asymptomatic. An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of [[herd immunity]] in the population can be determined from the results of this test.\n\nDue to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.<ref>{{cite news|title=A fiasco in the making?

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976)<ref name=\"MR\"/> and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).<ref name=\"MR\"/> It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation,<ref name=\"MR\"/> Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]]. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a [[PhD]]<ref name=mayphd/> degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from [[interplanetary dust]] and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System.

As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[IRAS]] satellite. After a [[Oral exam|viva voce]], the revised thesis (titled \"A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud\")<ref name=mayphd/> was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced.<ref name=buzzcocksphd>{{cite episode| series=Never Mind The Buzzcocks| station=BBC| seriesno=21| number=10| minutes=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/biog.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525083058/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/biog.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 May 2012 |title=BRIAN MAY \u2013 Official Biography |work=Brianmay.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last =May| first =Brian| title =News| url =http://www.brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsjul07.html| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120720094841/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsjul07.html| url-status=dead| archive-date =20 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Queen star hands in science PhD\"/><ref>{{cite news| title=Queen star celebrates doctorate |work=BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6961171.stm |accessdate=25 August 2007 | date=23 August 2007 }}</ref> He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became \"trendy\" again in the 2000s.

It is notable for using the [[Havok (software)|Havok 2.0]] physics engine extensively. The single player campaign gameplay involves killing large numbers of monsters. The game was particularly well received for its [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] experience and was featured for two seasons on the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]]'s World Tour.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Painkiller Shot0002.jpg|thumb|left|A gameplay screenshot of the Windows demo]]\n\nThe game is inspired by such classic titles as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'' and ''[[Serious Sam (series)|Serious Sam]]'', with the emphasis on killing large numbers of monsters. The game is divided into five chapters, each about five levels long. The player's objective is to get through each level, from start to finish, by slaughtering hundreds of monsters. Fighting monsters often occurs in mass battles, where the player has to fight an attack by a swarm of enemies in a large room, while the exits shut and heavy metal music plays in the background, and after such a battle, the player passes a \"checkpoint\" which advances the game, the exits open up again, and the music returns to the usual softer tune played in the level. (This \"arena\" feature has been adopted by other FPSes, most notably the 2016 [[DOOM (2016 video game)|DOOM reboot]].) One of the game's most important aspects is its diversity, with each level presenting a new location with various themes and graphic styles. The levels include castles, monasteries, an opera house, graveyards, and more. Monsters are also very different, with new ones almost every level. There are five \"boss\" levels where the player fights a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].\n\nThe game presents an option to complete a special task each level, which results in the player getting a \"tarot card\", a rare, hard-to-obtain bonus. Each equipped card provides different bonuses for a small amount of time (30 seconds), like powered-up weapons or slow motion.\n\nThe game also features a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. It includes classic modes like [[Deathmatch]] and Capture-the-Flag.\n\nPainkiller sucks painkiller is old fortnite is the best fortnite is very new Go Play Fortnite For FREE but first create a account to play Good luck\n\n== Release ==\nThe Special Edition release is a budget version of the game. It includes only 12 of the 24 levels in the full game, no full-motion videos, and no multiplayer mode. It does, however, show its award-winning features on the front case like PC Gaming World Game of the Year, ''[[Game Informer]]'' game of the month and [[GameSpy]]'s editor's choice.\n\nThe Gold/Black Edition combines the ''Battle Out of Hell'' expansion with the original game onto a single disc. It also features [[Mod (computer gaming)|mapping and editing tools]], a limited edition [[Penny Arcade]] poster, a [[making-of]] movie, and behind the scenes interviews, and the latest patch which adds new features to the game and bring its quality up to competition standard (see below). The technical difference is that the Gold Edition has the game over six CDs, while the Black Edition has the game on DVD.\n\n* The Universe/Triple Dose edition was released July 8, 2008. The original game, as well as the ''Battle Out of Hell'' and ''Overdose'' packages, are all contained in one case.\n* The Pandemonium Edition contains the original game as well as its three expansions ''Battle Out of Hell'', ''Overdose'' and ''Resurrection''.\n* The Collection contains all Painkiller Games with their expansions ''Black Edition'', ''Overdose'', ''Resurrection'', ''Redemption'', ''Recurring Evil'', ''Hell & Damnation'' (with all DLC content). It also features [[Mod (computer gaming)|mapping and editing tools]]. All games require [[Steam (software)|Steam]] if they are purchased in the Collection.\n\n=== Ports ===\nIn 2006 the game was ported by [[People Can Fly]] to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] as ''Painkiller: Hell Wars''. While not a straight port, it is actually a mix of the game and its expansion, ''Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell''. ''Painkiller: Hell Wars'' was also announced for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/Painkiller/index.html?q%3DPainkiller |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524163425/http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/painkiller/index.html?q=Painkiller |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}</ref> However, both versions were cancelled worldwide. The official publisher of ''Painkiller: Hell Wars'' was [[DreamCatcher Interactive]]. ''Painkiller: Purgatory (HD)'' was developed by Machineworks Northwest ([[level design]] by Med-Art) for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] and available on [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nThe soundtrack to the first game was written by [[Stephen Rippy]], David Rippy, and Kevin McMullan and released in 2004. [[IGN]] called it \"generic speed metal with a techno flourish\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/506/506057p1.html |title=Painkiller Original Soundtrack - IGN |website=Music.ign.com |date=April 12, 2004 |accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Expansions ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Overview of expansions in the ''Painkiller'' series\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Title\n!scope=\"col\" | Release\n!scope=\"col\" | [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n!scope=\"col\" | Consoles\n!scope=\"col\" | Developer\n!scope=\"col\" | Publisher\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n|''Painkiller: Battle out of Hell'' || 2004 || {{Yes}} || {{No}}\n|[[People Can Fly]]\n|[[DreamCatcher Interactive]]\n|Requires base game\n|-\n|''[[Painkiller: Overdose]]'' || 2007 || {{Yes}} || {{No}}\n|[[Mindware Studios]]\n|[[DreamCatcher Interactive]]\n|Stand-alone expansion\n|-\n|''[[Painkiller: Resurrection]]'' || 2009 || {{Yes}} || {{No}}\n|Homegrown Games\n|[[DreamCatcher Interactive]]\n|Stand-alone expansion \n|-\n|''Painkiller: Redemption'' || 2011 || {{Yes}} || {{No}}\n|Eggtooth Team\n|[[DreamCatcher Interactive]]\n|Stand-alone expansion\n|-\n|''Painkiller: Recurring Evil'' || 2012 || {{Yes}} || {{No}}\n|Med-Art\n|[[THQ Nordic]]\n|Stand-alone expansion\n|}\n\n=== ''Battle Out of Hell'' ===\n'''''Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell''''' is an expansion pack for ''Painkiller'', released on December 1, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/921498-painkiller-battle-out-of-hell/data}|title=Painkiller: Battle out of Hell for PC|date=December 1, 2004|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref> It was developed and published by the same companies as ''Painkiller''. ''Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell'' features an all-new 10-level single player campaign, two new weapons (with two fire modes each), new multiplayer game modes, and improved visual effects.\n\nThe story continues where the original left off: Lucifer is killed and his position as ruler of Hell is now free. Alastor, one of four hell generals Daniel Garner was assigned to kill in the original game, appears with a horde of demons and confronts Daniel, who now has to retreat with the help of Eve. Daniel's new goal is to battle out of hell and eliminate Alastor, who is now rightful ruler of the demonic forces. Before confronting his powerful enemy, Daniel visits such places as an orphanage full of possessed children, a hellish circus named Loony Park, a pirate bay, coliseums, Necropolis, and even a twisted version of [[Siege of Leningrad|World War II Leningrad]]. After Daniel kills Alastor, Eve absorbs Alastor's power, to Daniel's surprise. She transforms into the new ruler of hell, and thanks Daniel for allowing her to take control. Eve offers Daniel the chance to rule by her side, but Daniel refuses. Eve then invites Daniel to leave and join Catherine in Heaven, but Daniel again refuses, and begins firing his gun at Eve as the screen fades to black.\n\n=== ''Overdose'' ===\n{{main|Painkiller: Overdose}}\n'''''Painkiller: Overdose''''' is the second stand-alone ''Painkiller'' game and uses the same engine as the first. It was released for Windows on October 30, 2007 worldwide. Originally being developed by [[Mindware Studios|Mindware]] from the Czech Republic as a fan-made game mod, DreamCatcher Interactive granted the project full financial and technical support. In ''Overdose'', the player takes the role of [[Belial]], a half-angel, half-demon gatekeeper. The game contains 6 new weapons, 40 monster types and 16 new levels. The story is a spin-off and is said to tie wandering ends and provide a bridge between the original game and a potential sequel. On October 17, 2007, the demo was released. On October 23, 2007, DreamCatcher announced that the game had started shipping to retail stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.filefront.com/Painkiller-overdose-headed-to-a-store-near-you/|title=Non-Existent Domain|date=October 23, 2007|website=News.filefront.com|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe story is set just after Daniel kills Lucifer. The death of Hell's leader allows Belial, the prisoner and outcast, to escape and start his vendetta against those who imprisoned him: demonic beast [[Cerberus]] and Samael, an angel who betrayed his own kind. Belial starts his journey with killing his prison warden (and later using his head as a weapon). After traveling through various hellish places and defeating countless demons he kills Cerberus and reaches Samael's lair. There, Belial defeats the fallen angel and rips his wings off as an act of vengeance.\n\n=== ''Resurrection'' ===\n{{main|Painkiller: Resurrection}}\nOn April 9, 2009, Homegrown Games (developer) and DreamCatcher Interactive (publisher) revealed '''''Painkiller: Resurrection''''', a stand-alone expansion to the original game running on an updated PainEngine. It was released on October 27, 2009 for Microsoft Windows.<ref name=\"resurrectionreveal-IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/971/971617p1.html|title=Painkiller: Resurrection Revealed|last=Butts|first=Steve|date=April 9, 2009|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIt features six new levels, and a new hero: William \"Bill\" Sherman, who is blown to pieces by his own [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] payload, with which he wanted to eliminate a group of mobsters. The fact that he accidentally blew a bus full of innocent civilians means he is about to be claimed by Hell. However, he wakes up in purgatory and is tasked with redeeming his soul by battling a new demonic threat, which is revealed to be led by Astaroth, once a general of Lucifer, and Ramiel, a corrupted angel.\n\n=== ''Redemption'' ===\n'''''Painkiller: Redemption''''' is an add-on released in February 25, 2011, as a downloadable game. Similar to ''Overdose'', the new expansion pack was originally a mod, created by a small group of fans under the label \"Eggtooth'\". Additional development by \"Homegrown\". The official publisher of ''Painkiller: Redemption'' is DreamCatcher Interactive. It features a new heavy metal soundtrack, minor graphic changes, and six levels with nearly 6,000 enemies to kill. ''Painkiller Redemption'' features the return of Daniel Garner and Belial, both as playable characters. The development team has released free post-release support for the game, which includes extra content for multiplayer, or a new single-player chapter. Eggtooth Team didn't create any new content, so the maps used are the ones originally found in Painkiller multiplayer, and all monsters are taken from previous Painkiller installments, including the final boss, who uses the model of King Alastor from ''Battle Out of Hell''.\n\nThe game is narrated through animated text messages, and starts when Belial, the hero of ''Painkiller: Overdose'', saves Daniel Garner from Eve, the current queen of Hell. Together, Daniel and Belial fight a big battle through her minions in Purgatory, until they've found Bill Sherman, the protagonist of ''Painkiller: Resurrection''. With Bill's help, they are able to strike at Eve. The game ends with the surprising arrival of Samael, an angel of God who once tasked Daniel with destroying Hell's leaders. With Eve defeated, Samael plans to use the dark essence left by her to become a new ruler of Hell. The game concludes with Belial and Daniel understanding that the battle is not yet over.\n\n=== ''Recurring Evil'' ===\n'''''Painkiller: Recurring Evil''''' is an add-on featuring 5 new levels with about 4000 enemies. It was released digitally on February 29, 2012 by [[Nordic Games GmbH|Nordic Games]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], and developed by Med-Art and Eggtooth.\n\nIt continues the story of ''Resurrection'' and serves as a side story for ''Redemption''. Bill Sherman becomes the ruler of Purgatory, blessed with power of the Sword of Seraphim. However, the fallen angel Samael (now wingless after his defeat at the hands of Belial in [[Painkiller: Overdose]]), who took the power of Hell from Eve, steals Bill's sword and sends him to Purgatory's unexplored locations, forcing the fight to start again. Bill reaches Samael in the end of his journey, but the game ends without a fight, as the fallen angel defeats Bill. Depending on the player chooses the good or evil side, Bill is either killed by Samael, or rescued by Belial.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

[[GameRankings]].<ref name=\"gamerankings\"/> ''Painkiller'' was mostly praised for its simple yet entertaining FPS gameplay and its varied level and artistic design. [[GameSpot]] noted the variety in levels and foes by stating \"Remarkably, the eclectic variety of settings somehow ends up having a cohesive feel to it, and the variety itself is definitely to the game's credit\"<ref name=\"gamespot UK\"/> while [[GameSpy]] praised the graphics engine calling it \"an original, muscular engine, capable of vast spectacular levels\".<ref name=\"gamespy(PK)\"/> However while [[IGN]] noted the gameplay positively, they also mentioned repetition in certain stages going on to say \"simple aiming exercises seem to lack a little substance when compared to more recent shooters\".<ref name=\"IGN(PK)\"/> Another criticism was focused on its [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] aspect being similar to that of the older [[Quake (series)|''Quake'']] games, being called by GameSpot as a more of a \"throwback to the days of the original ''Quake''\" with the feel of \"[[deja vu]]\".<ref name=\"gamespot UK\"/>\n\nUpon its release, ''Painkiller'' received \"PC Game of the Month\" awards from ''[[Game Informer]]'' and [[GameSpot]], \"Editors Choice\" from GameSpy, ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' and ''[[PC Zone]]'', and \"Kick Ass Product\" from ''[[Maximum PC]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} ''Computer Games Magazine'' named ''Painkiller'' the third-best computer game of 2004. The editors wrote, \"''Painkiller'' is dumb turned up to 11, but it reaches a rarefied level of dumb where it flips around to become genius.\" It was a runner-up for the magazine's \"Best Art Direction\" award.<ref name=cgm14th>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=The Best of 2004; The 14th Annual ''Computer Games'' Awards |date=March 2005 | issue=172 | pages=48\u201356 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, Painkiller was featured on ''[[Escapist Magazine]]'''s weekly review series [[Zero Punctuation]]. Reviewer [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]], known for his acerbic reviews, stated that ''Painkiller'' was an example of an excellent FPS game, praising its removal of aspects such as key hunting and fetch side quests in favor of \"pure genocidal fun.\"<ref name=\"Escapist Magazine(PK)\">{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/57-Painkiller | title = The Escapist : Video Galleries : Zero Punctuation : Painkiller | publisher = Escapist Magazine | date = May 22, 2008 | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}</ref> Seemingly hours after the review, the ''Painkiller'' banner found on the Steam Store appeared on the front page, now sporting the tag \"All you really need to know is that there is a gun that shoots shurikens and lightning...\", a quote from the review.<ref name=\"Kotaku\">{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5010740/how-Painkiller-should-have-been-advertised | title = Adwatch: How Painkiller should have been advertised | author = Mike Fahey | publisher = Kotaku | date = May 23, 2008 | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}</ref> In 2010, [[UGO]] included the game on the list of the 42 Best Games Ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/Painkiller |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703044410/http://www.ugo.com/games/painkiller |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n''Battle out of Hell'' was also met with a positive response but with less only being an [[expansion pack]]. While some were enthusiastic over the new content, like Game Informer even saying \"If I had to pick a game to be the [[poster child]] for the concept of expansion packs, P''ainkiller: Battle Out Of Hell'' might well be it\",<ref name=\"gameinformer(BooH)\"/> others like GameSpot found some of the levels not as interesting as the original saying \"for the most part, much of the rest of the game is kind of bland\" but still found \"Great ''Painkiller'' gameplay mostly intact\". They also pointed out longer loading times and \"aggravating\" puzzles.<ref name=\"gamespot(BooH)\"/>\n\nUpon the release in 2006 of the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] port ''Hell Wars'', many were generally pleased with its translation while others found some issues. IGN were not favourable towards the \"Environmental textures\" that \"don't do much to enhance the experience\" and even found the port to have additional bugs like when enemies \"get stuck out of sight on a level [that] mean you can't advance until you reload your game\".<ref name=\"IGN(HW)\"/>\n\nThree years later in late 2007 when ''Overdose'' was released, reception, while also positive was quick to point the game's shortcomings. GameZone praised ''Overdose'' for retaining the basic gameplay elements that made the original 2004 title popular, and that it \"extends the world with new weapons, enemies, bosses, and levels that will fulfill any adrenaline junkie's craving\".<ref name=\"gamezone(OD)\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32995.htm | title = Painkiller: Overdose Review | author = Brock Smith | publisher = GameZone | date = May 11, 2007 | accessdate = November 12, 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107103809/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32995.htm | archivedate = November 7, 2007 }}</ref> GameSpot however were still annoyed by the long load times and unhappy with the quiet [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode but were still positive over the gameplay concluding\" this old-fashioned shooter is a welcome respite from the scripted, story-driven epics littering the FPS landscape these days (and a pleasant reminder of the simple joy of shooting fiendish creeps in the face)\".<ref name=\"gamespot OD\"/> However, Game Informer found the game to be aged and while \"there is a group out there who will find this game charming\", it concluded that \"their numbers might be growing thin.\"<ref name=\"gameinformer(OD)\"/>\n\n=== Competitive play ===\nAt the end of 2004 ''Painkiller'' was chosen by the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] to be their official [[Cyberathlete Professional League#Painkiller World Tour|2005 World Tour]] game.<ref name=\"Painkiller-cpl2005\">{{cite web | url = http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/Painkiller_cpl.pdf | title = Painkiller chosen as the unique official tournament game at 2005 CPL World Tour | work = DreamCatcher Games | accessdate = June 26, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090920014746/http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/painkiller_cpl.pdf | archivedate = September 20, 2009 }}</ref> This was slightly controversial with many [[esports]] followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] format competition, ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' and ''[[Doom 3]]'' were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' developer [[Epic Games]] was in the process of changing publishers from [[Atari]] to [[Midway Games]] and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year-long tour, it was not chosen.\n\nThis agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher also meant that no other organization was allowed to use ''Painkiller'' in a gaming competition with prizes above {{USD}}2,000.- without obtaining a license from the CPL. It also had effects on ''Painkiller'' beyond professional competition; a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] was released to add new features to the game and bring its quality up to competition standard. This updated version of the game also resulted in a special edition re-release of the game bearing the CPL World Tour logo, entitled ''Painkiller: Gold Edition'' in North America and ''Painkiller: Black Edition'' elsewhere. This new version contained both ''Painkiller'' and its expansion pack ''Painkiller: Battle out of Hell'' unpatched, among other additions including a video about the making of the game. However, ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' was selected as the one-versus-one deathmatch game of the CPL for 2006, replacing ''Painkiller''.<ref name=\"quake3-cpl2006\">{{cite web | url = http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/06/07/21/quake-3-chosen-as-cpls-2006-world-season-1vs1-game | title = Quake 3 chosen as CPL's 2006 World Season 1vs1 game | work = neowin.net | accessdate = June 26, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090915193243/http://www.neowin.net/news/gamers/06/07/21/quake-3-chosen-as-cpls-2006-world-season-1vs1-game | archivedate = September 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Remake and sequel==\n{{main|Painkiller: Hell & Damnation}}\n\n''Painkiller: Hell & Damnation'', developed by [[The Farm 51]] on [[Unreal Engine 3]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://worthplaying.com/event/E3_2012/PostE3_2012/86392/ | title = PC Preview - 'Painkiller: Hell & Damnation' | author = Tony \"OUberLord\" Mitera | publisher = Worthplaying.com | date = June 11, 2012 | accessdate = June 21, 2012}}</ref> was released in 2012.

It is notable for using the [[Havok (software)|Havok 2.0]] physics engine extensively. The single player campaign gameplay involves killing large numbers of monsters. The game was particularly well received for its [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] experience and was featured for two seasons on the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]]'s World Tour.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Painkiller Shot0002.jpg|thumb|left|A gameplay screenshot of the Windows demo]]\n\nThe game is inspired by such classic titles as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'' and ''[[Serious Sam (series)|Serious Sam]]'', with the emphasis on killing large numbers of monsters. The game is divided into five chapters, each about five levels long. The player's objective is to get through each level, from start to finish, by slaughtering hundreds of monsters. Fighting monsters often occurs in mass battles, where the player has to fight an attack by a swarm of enemies in a large room, while the exits shut and heavy metal music plays in the background, and after such a battle, the player passes a \"checkpoint\" which advances the game, the exits open up again, and the music returns to the usual softer tune played in the level. (This \"arena\" feature has been adopted by other FPSes, most notably the 2016 [[DOOM (2016 video game)|DOOM reboot]].) One of the game's most important aspects is its diversity, with each level presenting a new location with various themes and graphic styles. The levels include castles, monasteries, an opera house, graveyards, and more. Monsters are also very different, with new ones almost every level. There are five \"boss\" levels where the player fights a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].\n\nThe game presents an option to complete a special task each level, which results in the player getting a \"tarot card\", a rare, hard-to-obtain bonus. Each equipped card provides different bonuses for a small amount of time (30 seconds), like powered-up weapons or slow motion.\n\nThe game also features a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. It includes classic modes like [[Deathmatch]] and Capture-the-Flag.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game revolves around a young man named Daniel Garner ([[Cam Clarke]]), who is happily married to his wife Catherine ([[Vanessa Marshall]]). At the start of the game, Daniel is about to take Catherine out for a birthday meal. As they drive towards their destination at high speed, in the pouring rain, Daniel takes his eyes off the road to look at his wife and while his attention is diverted, he ploughs their car into a truck. Both of them are killed instantly in the crash.\n\nWhile Catherine manages to make it to [[Heaven]] and lives in harmony, Daniel is trapped in [[Purgatory]]. One day, an angel called [[Samael]] ([[John Cygan]]) tells him that in order to receive purification, he has to kill four of [[Satan|Lucifer's]] generals in order to prevent a war between Heaven and [[Hell]]. Lucifer has been secretly organizing a massive army that could overwhelm Heaven, taking over [[Purgatory]] in the process. Small portions of the army are already beginning the march. With little choice available to him, Daniel accepts the task. With the forces of Hell seizing and corrupting various parts of Purgatory, Daniel goes through different and random phases of history within Purgatory, which range greatly from ancient times to the modern era, including [[Medieval Europe]], [[Babylon]], [[the Crusades]], the 1800s, and a time slice of modern industry.\n\nAfter killing the first general, Daniel meets a woman named Eve ([[Vanessa Marshall]]), another soul who has been in Purgatory for a long time. She gives him information about the whereabouts of the remaining generals and small elements of Lucifer's army already mobilizing. She also tells him about life in Purgatory, and the possibility that he could be dragged to Hell should he fall in battle and become lost forever. While this is all understood, what Daniel does not understand is why he came here, but Eve insists it is because of something in his past, and it is up to him to find out.\n\nAfter the second general's defeat and reuniting with Eve, Daniel travels to meet a demonic friend named [[Asmodeus]] ([[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]), for information about new rallying positions for Lucifer's armies. Asmodeus once saved Daniel's life after he single-handedly defeated four demons at once one day, almost losing himself in the process. Eve is wary of Asmodeus and questions as to why he did not finish off Daniel when he was weak, but he insists that he did not come to Purgatory to fill the graves with lost souls like the others. He also questions Eve if she is really \"[[Eve|The Eve]]\" referenced in the Bible, to which Daniel jokes \"Where is Adam?\" before continuing on.\n\nAfter the third general's defeat, he confronts Samael, having had enough of the fighting and wanting out of Purgatory, but Samael remains firm with Daniel that it is not that simple to leave and he must finish the task given to him. After being directed to the whereabouts of [[Alastor]] ([[Jim Cummings]]), Lucifer's right-hand and final general, Daniel is warned that Alastor is already aware that he is being pursued and his own elite soldiers are prepared and waiting. Daniel reluctantly continues his quest for purification.\n\nAfter Daniel kills Alastor, Eve arrives at the scene in shock, realizing Lucifer will no doubt be on his way and they should make themselves ready. Surprisingly, Asmodeus arrives, complimenting Daniel for his victory and examining the scene. Suddenly, both Eve and Daniel find Asmodeus highly suspicious and try questioning him as to why he is really in Purgatory, to which he eventually replies, \"I dig graves\". Suddenly, he dissolves into a ball of fire and Lucifer himself ([[Lex Lang]]) appears. He mocks Daniel while recognizing him as a worthy opponent and thanking him for removing Alastor, who had been constantly arguing with Lucifer that the armies should have attacked sooner rather than wait. He snatches Eve, whom he claims had escaped from Hell, and takes her with him before disappearing back into Hell.\n\nSamael appears, congratulating Daniel for his success and informs him his task is done. Now he may proceed to Heaven and reunite with Catherine. But Daniel refuses, knowing that it is not over yet, \"not even close\" to use his words. He also knows that it would be only a matter of time before Lucifer can fledge a new and massive enough army, but the next time would be far worse. He decides to go after them, but Samael tries to make him reconsider, for if Daniel goes to Hell, there will be no escaping from there. Daniel turns down the offer once more and asks that Catherine be told not to wait for him, for he will not be coming. Samael gives in and shows him the direction to the gates of Hell, warning that they are protected from the inside by the most elite of the demonic forces for the purpose of keeping the souls of those who are damned within Hell.\n\nDaniel eventually emerges in Hell, a twisted landscape made of torn fragments from various wars throughout history (a play on the phrase \"[[William Tecumseh Sherman#Postbellum service|War Is Hell]]\"). After vanquishing enough souls of the damned, most of which are recognizable as foes he has defeated, he confronts Lucifer in Demon Mode and kills him, rescuing Eve in the process, who has been rendered unconscious. After killing Lucifer, Alastor reappears before him, with hordes of demons around him. Daniel learns that he did not really kill Alastor as he could only be defeated in Hell. With Lucifer gone, the position of Hell's ruler is open. [[Alastor]] has already taken it and announced his ultimatum. He leaves Daniel to the mercy of the demons around him, who eagerly accepts the challenge. The game ends with Daniel defending himself against the never-ending hordes.\n\nIf the game is finished in Trauma (the hardest difficulty in the game), an extra ending is presented. Daniel is now finally able to go to Heaven and reunite with Catherine at last.\n\n== Release ==\nThe Special Edition release is a budget version of the game. It includes only 12 of the 24 levels in the full game, no full-motion videos, and no multiplayer mode. It does, however, show its award-winning features on the front case like PC Gaming World Game of the Year, ''[[Game Informer]]'' game of the month and [[GameSpy]]'s editor's choice.\n\nThe Gold/Black Edition combines the ''Battle Out of Hell'' expansion with the original game onto a single disc. It also features [[Mod (computer gaming)|mapping and editing tools]], a limited edition [[Penny Arcade]] poster, a [[making-of]] movie, and behind the scenes interviews, and the latest patch which adds new features to the game and bring its quality up to competition standard (see below). The technical difference is that the Gold Edition has the game over six CDs, while the Black Edition has the game on DVD.\n\n* The Universe/Triple Dose edition was released July 8, 2008. The original game, as well as the ''Battle Out of Hell'' and ''Overdose'' packages, are all contained in one case.\n* The Pandemonium Edition contains the original game as well as its three expansions ''Battle Out of Hell'', ''Overdose'' and ''Resurrection''.\n* The Collection contains all Painkiller Games with their expansions ''Black Edition'', ''Overdose'', ''Resurrection'', ''Redemption'', ''Recurring Evil'', ''Hell & Damnation'' (with all DLC content). It also features [[Mod (computer gaming)|mapping and editing tools]]. All games require [[Steam (software)|Steam]] if they are purchased in the Collection.\n\n=== Ports ===\nIn 2006 the game was ported by [[People Can Fly]] to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] as ''Painkiller: Hell Wars''. While not a straight port, it is actually a mix of the game and its expansion, ''Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell''. ''Painkiller: Hell Wars'' was also announced for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/Painkiller/index.html?q%3DPainkiller |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524163425/http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/painkiller/index.html?q=Painkiller |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}</ref> However, both versions were cancelled worldwide.

''Painkiller: Battle Out of Hell'' features an all-new 10-level single player campaign, two new weapons (with two fire modes each), new multiplayer game modes, and improved visual effects.\n\nThe story continues where the original left off: Lucifer is killed and his position as ruler of Hell is now free. Alastor, one of four hell generals Daniel Garner was assigned to kill in the original game, appears with a horde of demons and confronts Daniel, who now has to retreat with the help of Eve. Daniel's new goal is to battle out of hell and eliminate Alastor, who is now rightful ruler of the demonic forces. Before confronting his powerful enemy, Daniel visits such places as an orphanage full of possessed children, a hellish circus named Loony Park, a pirate bay, coliseums, Necropolis, and even a twisted version of [[Siege of Leningrad|World War II Leningrad]]. After Daniel kills Alastor, Eve absorbs Alastor's power, to Daniel's surprise. She transforms into the new ruler of hell, and thanks Daniel for allowing her to take control. Eve offers Daniel the chance to rule by her side, but Daniel refuses. Eve then invites Daniel to leave and join Catherine in Heaven, but Daniel again refuses, and begins firing his gun at Eve as the screen fades to black.\n\n=== ''Overdose'' ===\n{{main|Painkiller: Overdose}}\n'''''Painkiller: Overdose''''' is the second stand-alone ''Painkiller'' game and uses the same engine as the first. It was released for Windows on October 30, 2007 worldwide. Originally being developed by [[Mindware Studios|Mindware]] from the Czech Republic as a fan-made game mod, DreamCatcher Interactive granted the project full financial and technical support. In ''Overdose'', the player takes the role of [[Belial]], a half-angel, half-demon gatekeeper. The game contains 6 new weapons, 40 monster types and 16 new levels. The story is a spin-off and is said to tie wandering ends and provide a bridge between the original game and a potential sequel. On October 17, 2007, the demo was released. On October 23, 2007, DreamCatcher announced that the game had started shipping to retail stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.filefront.com/Painkiller-overdose-headed-to-a-store-near-you/|title=Non-Existent Domain|date=October 23, 2007|website=News.filefront.com|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe story is set just after Daniel kills Lucifer. The death of Hell's leader allows Belial, the prisoner and outcast, to escape and start his vendetta against those who imprisoned him: demonic beast [[Cerberus]] and Samael, an angel who betrayed his own kind. Belial starts his journey with killing his prison warden (and later using his head as a weapon). After traveling through various hellish places and defeating countless demons he kills Cerberus and reaches Samael's lair. There, Belial defeats the fallen angel and rips his wings off as an act of vengeance.\n\n=== ''Resurrection'' ===\n{{main|Painkiller: Resurrection}}\nOn April 9, 2009, Homegrown Games (developer) and DreamCatcher Interactive (publisher) revealed '''''Painkiller: Resurrection''''', a stand-alone expansion to the original game running on an updated PainEngine. It was released on October 27, 2009 for Microsoft Windows.<ref name=\"resurrectionreveal-IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/971/971617p1.html|title=Painkiller: Resurrection Revealed|last=Butts|first=Steve|date=April 9, 2009|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIt features six new levels, and a new hero: William \"Bill\" Sherman, who is blown to pieces by his own [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] payload, with which he wanted to eliminate a group of mobsters. The fact that he accidentally blew a bus full of innocent civilians means he is about to be claimed by Hell. However, he wakes up in purgatory and is tasked with redeeming his soul by battling a new demonic threat, which is revealed to be led by Astaroth, once a general of Lucifer, and Ramiel, a corrupted angel.\n\n=== ''Redemption'' ===\n'''''Painkiller: Redemption''''' is an add-on released in February 25, 2011, as a downloadable game. Similar to ''Overdose'', the new expansion pack was originally a mod, created by a small group of fans under the label \"Eggtooth'\". Additional development by \"Homegrown\". The official publisher of ''Painkiller: Redemption'' is DreamCatcher Interactive. It features a new heavy metal soundtrack, minor graphic changes, and six levels with nearly 6,000 enemies to kill. ''Painkiller Redemption'' features the return of Daniel Garner and Belial, both as playable characters. The development team has released free post-release support for the game, which includes extra content for multiplayer, or a new single-player chapter. Eggtooth Team didn't create any new content, so the maps used are the ones originally found in Painkiller multiplayer, and all monsters are taken from previous Painkiller installments, including the final boss, who uses the model of King Alastor from ''Battle Out of Hell''.\n\nThe game is narrated through animated text messages, and starts when Belial, the hero of ''Painkiller: Overdose'', saves Daniel Garner from Eve, the current queen of Hell. Together, Daniel and Belial fight a big battle through her minions in Purgatory, until they've found Bill Sherman, the protagonist of ''Painkiller: Resurrection''. With Bill's help, they are able to strike at Eve. The game ends with the surprising arrival of Samael, an angel of God who once tasked Daniel with destroying Hell's leaders. With Eve defeated, Samael plans to use the dark essence left by her to become a new ruler of Hell. The game concludes with Belial and Daniel understanding that the battle is not yet over.\n\n=== ''Recurring Evil'' ===\n'''''Painkiller: Recurring Evil''''' is an add-on featuring 5 new levels with about 4000 enemies. It was released digitally on February 29, 2012 by [[Nordic Games GmbH|Nordic Games]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], and developed by Med-Art and Eggtooth.\n\nIt continues the story of ''Resurrection'' and serves as a side story for ''Redemption''. Bill Sherman becomes the ruler of Purgatory, blessed with power of the Sword of Seraphim. However, the fallen angel Samael (now wingless after his defeat at the hands of Belial in [[Painkiller: Overdose]]), who took the power of Hell from Eve, steals Bill's sword and sends him to Purgatory's unexplored locations, forcing the fight to start again. Bill reaches Samael in the end of his journey, but the game ends without a fight, as the fallen angel defeats Bill. Depending on the player chooses the good or evil side, Bill is either killed by Samael, or rescued by Belial.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

[[GameRankings]].<ref name=\"gamerankings\"/> ''Painkiller'' was mostly praised for its simple yet entertaining FPS gameplay and its varied level and artistic design. [[GameSpot]] noted the variety in levels and foes by stating \"Remarkably, the eclectic variety of settings somehow ends up having a cohesive feel to it, and the variety itself is definitely to the game's credit\"<ref name=\"gamespot UK\"/> while [[GameSpy]] praised the graphics engine calling it \"an original, muscular engine, capable of vast spectacular levels\".<ref name=\"gamespy(PK)\"/> However while [[IGN]] noted the gameplay positively, they also mentioned repetition in certain stages going on to say \"simple aiming exercises seem to lack a little substance when compared to more recent shooters\".<ref name=\"IGN(PK)\"/> Another criticism was focused on its [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] aspect being similar to that of the older [[Quake (series)|''Quake'']] games, being called by GameSpot as a more of a \"throwback to the days of the original ''Quake''\" with the feel of \"[[deja vu]]\".<ref name=\"gamespot UK\"/>\n\nUpon its release, ''Painkiller'' received \"PC Game of the Month\" awards from ''[[Game Informer]]'' and [[GameSpot]], \"Editors Choice\" from GameSpy, ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' and ''[[PC Zone]]'', and \"Kick Ass Product\" from ''[[Maximum PC]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} ''Computer Games Magazine'' named ''Painkiller'' the third-best computer game of 2004. The editors wrote, \"''Painkiller'' is dumb turned up to 11, but it reaches a rarefied level of dumb where it flips around to become genius.\" It was a runner-up for the magazine's \"Best Art Direction\" award.<ref name=cgm14th>{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=The Best of 2004; The 14th Annual ''Computer Games'' Awards |date=March 2005 | issue=172 | pages=48\u201356 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, Painkiller was featured on ''[[Escapist Magazine]]'''s weekly review series [[Zero Punctuation]]. Reviewer [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]], known for his acerbic reviews, stated that ''Painkiller'' was an example of an excellent FPS game, praising its removal of aspects such as key hunting and fetch side quests in favor of \"pure genocidal fun.\"<ref name=\"Escapist Magazine(PK)\">{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/57-Painkiller | title = The Escapist : Video Galleries : Zero Punctuation : Painkiller | publisher = Escapist Magazine | date = May 22, 2008 | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}</ref> Seemingly hours after the review, the ''Painkiller'' banner found on the Steam Store appeared on the front page, now sporting the tag \"All you really need to know is that there is a gun that shoots shurikens and lightning...\", a quote from the review.<ref name=\"Kotaku\">{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5010740/how-Painkiller-should-have-been-advertised | title = Adwatch: How Painkiller should have been advertised | author = Mike Fahey | publisher = Kotaku | date = May 23, 2008 | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}</ref> In 2010, [[UGO]] included the game on the list of the 42 Best Games Ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/Painkiller |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703044410/http://www.ugo.com/games/painkiller |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n''Battle out of Hell'' was also met with a positive response but with less only being an [[expansion pack]]. While some were enthusiastic over the new content, like Game Informer even saying \"If I had to pick a game to be the [[poster child]] for the concept of expansion packs, P''ainkiller: Battle Out Of Hell'' might well be it\",<ref name=\"gameinformer(BooH)\"/> others like GameSpot found some of the levels not as interesting as the original saying \"for the most part, much of the rest of the game is kind of bland\" but still found \"Great ''Painkiller'' gameplay mostly intact\". They also pointed out longer loading times and \"aggravating\" puzzles.<ref name=\"gamespot(BooH)\"/>\n\nUpon the release in 2006 of the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] port ''Hell Wars'', many were generally pleased with its translation while others found some issues. IGN were not favourable towards the \"Environmental textures\" that \"don't do much to enhance the experience\" and even found the port to have additional bugs like when enemies \"get stuck out of sight on a level [that] mean you can't advance until you reload your game\".<ref name=\"IGN(HW)\"/>\n\nThree years later in late 2007 when ''Overdose'' was released, reception, while also positive was quick to point the game's shortcomings. GameZone praised ''Overdose'' for retaining the basic gameplay elements that made the original 2004 title popular, and that it \"extends the world with new weapons, enemies, bosses, and levels that will fulfill any adrenaline junkie's craving\".<ref name=\"gamezone(OD)\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32995.htm | title = Painkiller: Overdose Review | author = Brock Smith | publisher = GameZone | date = May 11, 2007 | accessdate = November 12, 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107103809/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32995.htm | archivedate = November 7, 2007 }}</ref> GameSpot however were still annoyed by the long load times and unhappy with the quiet [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode but were still positive over the gameplay concluding\" this old-fashioned shooter is a welcome respite from the scripted, story-driven epics littering the FPS landscape these days (and a pleasant reminder of the simple joy of shooting fiendish creeps in the face)\".<ref name=\"gamespot OD\"/> However, Game Informer found the game to be aged and while \"there is a group out there who will find this game charming\", it concluded that \"their numbers might be growing thin.\"<ref name=\"gameinformer(OD)\"/>\n\n=== Competitive play ===\nAt the end of 2004 ''Painkiller'' was chosen by the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] to be their official [[Cyberathlete Professional League#Painkiller World Tour|2005 World Tour]] game.<ref name=\"Painkiller-cpl2005\">{{cite web | url = http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/Painkiller_cpl.pdf | title = Painkiller chosen as the unique official tournament game at 2005 CPL World Tour | work = DreamCatcher Games | accessdate = June 26, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090920014746/http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/painkiller_cpl.pdf | archivedate = September 20, 2009 }}</ref> This was slightly controversial with many [[esports]] followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] format competition, ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' and ''[[Doom 3]]'' were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' developer [[Epic Games]] was in the process of changing publishers from [[Atari]] to [[Midway Games]] and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year-long tour, it was not chosen.\n\nThis agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher also meant that no other organization was allowed to use ''Painkiller'' in a gaming competition with prizes above {{USD}}2,000.- without obtaining a license from the CPL. It also had effects on ''Painkiller'' beyond professional competition; a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] was released to add new features to the game and bring its quality up to competition standard. This updated version of the game also resulted in a special edition re-release of the game bearing the CPL World Tour logo, entitled ''Painkiller: Gold Edition'' in North America and ''Painkiller: Black Edition'' elsewhere. This new version contained both ''Painkiller'' and its expansion pack ''Painkiller: Battle out of Hell'' unpatched, among other additions including a video about the making of the game.

RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode.

Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed:<br>\nAiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]];<br>\nBrita as [[Jennifer Holliday]];<br>\nCrystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]];<br>\nGigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\";<br>\nHeidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]];<br>\nJackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]];<br>\nJan as [[Bernadette Peters]];<br>\nJaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]];<br>\nSherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]];<br>\nWidow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].<br>\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]].

RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

{"title_page": "Historic bridges of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:BridgeRoadway7 1 32.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Sydney Harbour Bridge]]\nThis list documents historical [[bridge]]s located in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Road, rail and pedestrian bridges are listed.\nGenerally bridges built before WWII (1939) have been included in this list.\n\n==Historical context==\nBridge construction in New South Wales starts with the needs of the first settlers and continues through to the present day with advanced bridge design. The infant colony had limited expertise and limited materials. As time passed, techniques and materials were developed that allowed greater spans to be crossed and therefore expansion of the colony into otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nThe [[Office of Public Works and Services, New South Wales|NSW Public Works Department]] was under pressure from a cash strapped government to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible.<ref name=rta/> The cheapest bridge was the [[Truss bridge|timber truss]] which could be built with local timber.\n\nAll bridges are unique in the sense that the bridges were built using various technology, expertise, or materials or how they gained access to an area.\n\nFor example, at the time of early settlement, (1788 onwards) NSW was very isolated from the technological advances being developed in Europe and North America. Materials such as [[cast iron]] were unavailable to early colonial NSW bridge builders. NSW bridge builders had to rely on their own resourcefulness, bred of isolation, distance and the unique environment to make these bridges.\n\nNew South Wales's unusual environment, in general, results in unusual, and extreme river flows. This resulted in almost no water flow for most of the year with some flow each year and extreme floods around once a decade. Inland, the environment causes a low pressure system coming over the continent, due to a large high pressure of the Indian Ocean. This often occurs at summer, at which time it causes cyclone season, although it can occur at any time of year (but not inducing cyclones). At the coast, the cause is the \"east coast low\", which occurs at similar places at  the eastern edge of a number continents, and sees the continent's  normal high pressure  systems becomes  one large and stationary system, perhaps due to doldrums over the west coast's ocean.    This phenomenon causes the global trade winds deviate, - inducing the  low pressures  at polar and tropical latitudes to connect along the east coast - producing a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] situation that mimics a tropical [[monsoon]]. An east coast low rain event can occur at any time of the year.  Early settlers often  replaced washed out bridges with a similarly rudimentary structure, only to see it also washed away in a heavy rain event.  The government came to see that this was a major problem holding back economic development in New South Wales.\n\nIn solving these problems, colonial NSW embraced the innovations produced by others and adapted them successfully to the unique situations presented. There are examples of some fine 19th-century bridge engineering provided for the railway expansion, conceived mainly by British engineers working in the then isolation of the Australian inland. One examples of many of the newer European techniques that were used was the idea of the [[cable-stayed bridge]]s.\n\nAustralia developed around coastal communities with rudimentary road systems to inland settlements. The early years saw early bridge technology limited very much to the 18th-century European technology of [[Arch bridge|masonry arch]]es and cast iron, the latter still in its infancy and not produced to any great extent in New South Wales.\n\nNSW at the time of early settlement had an abundance of [[Convicts in Australia|convict labour]] and had a need for rapid construction. In a country heavily timbered this led to basic timber structure bridges but as the colony gained stability, the government looked towards more permanent structures. Furthermore, as the skills for quarrying and stone dressing became available, masonry bridges began to be designed and built. As all metal materials had to be imported, iron bridges were rarely appropriate and were in any case still too novel for colonial application. Iron bridges were only used for major crossings on important corridors.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/358.html|title=Technology in Australia 1788-1988|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=23 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=rta>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300159|title=Heritage & Conservation Register|publisher=NSW Government-Roads and Traffic Authority|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe following list illustrates the development of New South Wales bridge construction techniques.

His design consisted of vertical and diagonal arrangements comprising a combination of timber and iron elements. The timber elements were designed to be in compression and the iron elements in tension. Allen's design followed extensive testing of Australian hardwoods by Prof. Warren and his early engineering students at Sydney University. The timber used was mostly ironbark because of its high strength. Other features of Allan's truss design included design to minimize later maintenance and/or replacement of elements. For this reason the trusses were built in pairs to facilitate work on a particular element without requiring the whole bridge to be supported, as was the case with previous timber designs. Allan's design was very cost-effective.\n\nThe [[Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)|Hampden Bridge]] in New South Wales Australia was the first of a larger style bridge to be built on Percy Allan\u2019s design<ref name=allantruss>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/truss-bridge-types.html|title=Types Of Truss Bridges|publisher=Bozzle Website|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref> with the [[Tharwa Bridge]]  pre-dating it.\n\n==Dare type truss==\nHarvey Dare was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. He was a designer of bridges and he developed the Dare Truss which was similar to the Allan truss but contained improvements which made them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Dare Trusses were the fifth of the five stages of evolution of timber truss road bridges in NSW.<ref name=rta/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=rta/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering|Transport|Australian roads|Railways}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges in New South Wales| ]]\n[[Category:New South Wales-related lists]]\n[[Category:History of transport in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Lists of bridges|New South Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:BridgeRoadway7 1 32.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Sydney Harbour Bridge]]\nThis list documents historical [[bridge]]s located in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Road, rail and pedestrian bridges are listed.\nGenerally bridges built before WWII (1939) have been included in this list.\n\n==Historical context==\nBridge construction in New South Wales starts with the needs of the first settlers and continues through to the present day with advanced bridge design. The infant colony had limited expertise and limited materials. As time passed, techniques and materials were developed that allowed greater spans to be crossed and therefore expansion of the colony into otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nThe [[Office of Public Works and Services, New South Wales|NSW Public Works Department]] was under pressure from a cash strapped government to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible.<ref name=rta/> The cheapest bridge was the [[Truss bridge|timber truss]] which could be built with local timber.\n\nAll bridges are unique in the sense that the bridges were built using various technology, expertise, or materials or how they gained access to an area.\n\nFor example, at the time of early settlement, (1788 onwards) NSW was very isolated from the technological advances being developed in Europe and North America. Materials such as [[cast iron]] were unavailable to early colonial NSW bridge builders. NSW bridge builders had to rely on their own resourcefulness, bred of isolation, distance and the unique environment to make these bridges.\n\nNew South Wales's unusual environment, in general, results in unusual, and extreme river flows. This resulted in almost no water flow for most of the year with some flow each year and extreme floods around once a decade. Inland, the environment causes a low pressure system coming over the continent, due to a large high pressure of the Indian Ocean. This often occurs at summer, at which time it causes cyclone season, although it can occur at any time of year (but not inducing cyclones). At the coast, the cause is the \"east coast low\", which occurs at similar places at  the eastern edge of a number continents, and sees the continent's  normal high pressure  systems becomes  one large and stationary system, perhaps due to doldrums over the west coast's ocean.    This phenomenon causes the global trade winds deviate, - inducing the  low pressures  at polar and tropical latitudes to connect along the east coast - producing a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] situation that mimics a tropical [[monsoon]]. An east coast low rain event can occur at any time of the year.  Early settlers often  replaced washed out bridges with a similarly rudimentary structure, only to see it also washed away in a heavy rain event.  The government came to see that this was a major problem holding back economic development in New South Wales.\n\nIn solving these problems, colonial NSW embraced the innovations produced by others and adapted them successfully to the unique situations presented. There are examples of some fine 19th-century bridge engineering provided for the railway expansion, conceived mainly by British engineers working in the then isolation of the Australian inland. One examples of many of the newer European techniques that were used was the idea of the [[cable-stayed bridge]]s.\n\nAustralia developed around coastal communities with rudimentary road systems to inland settlements. The early years saw early bridge technology limited very much to the 18th-century European technology of [[Arch bridge|masonry arch]]es and cast iron, the latter still in its infancy and not produced to any great extent in New South Wales.\n\nNSW at the time of early settlement had an abundance of [[Convicts in Australia|convict labour]] and had a need for rapid construction. In a country heavily timbered this led to basic timber structure bridges but as the colony gained stability, the government looked towards more permanent structures. Furthermore, as the skills for quarrying and stone dressing became available, masonry bridges began to be designed and built. As all metal materials had to be imported, iron bridges were rarely appropriate and were in any case still too novel for colonial application. Iron bridges were only used for major crossings on important corridors.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/358.html|title=Technology in Australia 1788-1988|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=23 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=rta>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300159|title=Heritage & Conservation Register|publisher=NSW Government-Roads and Traffic Authority|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe following list illustrates the development of New South Wales bridge construction techniques.

His design consisted of vertical and diagonal arrangements comprising a combination of timber and iron elements. The timber elements were designed to be in compression and the iron elements in tension. Allen's design followed extensive testing of Australian hardwoods by Prof. Warren and his early engineering students at Sydney University. The timber used was mostly ironbark because of its high strength. Other features of Allan's truss design included design to minimize later maintenance and/or replacement of elements. For this reason the trusses were built in pairs to facilitate work on a particular element without requiring the whole bridge to be supported, as was the case with previous timber designs. Allan's design was very cost-effective.\n\nThe [[Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)|Hampden Bridge]] in New South Wales Australia was the first of a larger style bridge to be built on Percy Allan\u2019s design<ref name=allantruss>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/truss-bridge-types.html|title=Types Of Truss Bridges|publisher=Bozzle Website|accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}</ref> with the [[Tharwa Bridge]]  pre-dating it.\n\n==Dare type truss==\nHarvey Dare was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. He was a designer of bridges and he developed the Dare Truss which was similar to the Allan truss but contained improvements which made them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Dare Trusses were the fifth of the five stages of evolution of timber truss road bridges in NSW.<ref name=rta/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=rta/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering|Transport|Australian roads|Railways}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges in New South Wales| ]]\n[[Category:New South Wales-related lists]]\n[[Category:History of transport in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Lists of bridges|New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNew South Wales historic bridges:split table", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_bridges_of_New_South_Wales"}
