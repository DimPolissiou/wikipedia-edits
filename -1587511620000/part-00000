The premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for breaking rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, [[Ian Terry]] won the season by a 6\u20131 vote over runner-up [[Dan Gheesling]].<ref>Patrick Gomez,[http://people.com/tv/big-brother-14-winner-revealed/], ''People Magazine''>, September 20, 2012.

It was also the first to have two vetos at one veto ceremony.\n\nIn a change from past seasons, four former HouseGuests from past seasons of ''Big Brother'' returned to coach the new HouseGuests during their time in the House. Each coach had to pick three of the new HouseGuests that they will guide throughout the entire game. When a HouseGuests wins Head of Household the coach of that Housemate will also gain their own private room adjacent to the Head of Household bedroom. The coaches compete in a new competition that replaces Have vs. Have-Not competition for the season. The winning coach is granted the power to give one of their players immunity for the week or to trade one of their players for a player from another team. Depending on the rules of the coach's competition, each coach then has to choose one of their own players to become a \"Have Not\" for the week or the winning coach has the opportunity of choosing all of the \"Have Nots\". HouseGuests that are chosen to be \"Have Nots\" for the week had to eat \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food restriction (chosen by the viewing public), take cold showers, and sleep on hard beds. The coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize and the $50,000 runner-up prize but instead were to be awarded a separate $100,000 prize if one of their chosen HouseGuests wins Big Brother. However, on Week 3, America voted to allow the coaches to vote whether to keep coaching or become HouseGuests. Three of four voted to reset the game, and all coaches earned HouseGuest status, now eligible to win the $500,000 grand prize.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n\nA total of sixteen HouseGuests entered the house, the same number of HouseGuests competing in ''[[Big Brother 9 (American season)|Big Brother 9]]''.

However, unlike previous seasons where the returning players competed as regular HouseGuests, the veterans were tasked with coaching three of the new players. Upon entering the house, the coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize, and were instead competing to win a separate prize of $100,000, which would be awarded to the coach of the winning HouseGuest. However, after the July 26 live eviction episode, viewers were allowed to vote on whether or not to give the coaches the option of entering the game as regular players for the $500,000 prize. On August 2, America's Vote was revealed. The result was to offer the coaches the option of entering the game. Julie Chen revealed that each coach would be called into the Diary Room individually to cast their vote to keep coaching or not. Inside the diary room was a reset button, signifying the game's reset for the coaches. If at least one coach decides to reset, all coaches would earn HouseGuest status. A 3\u20131 vote brought the coaches into the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; \n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Age on entry\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Occupation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Residence\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Big Brother'' History\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Big Brother 14'' results\n|-\n!

He finished in 12th place. Jodi Rollins made a brief Cameo on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S. season)|first season]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Britney Haynes returned for ''[[Big Brother 20 (U.S. season)|Big Brother 20]]'' where she celebrated the engagement of two-time ''Big Brother'' houseguest Nicole Franzel and season 18 houseguest Victor Arroyo. Haynes and [[Janelle Pierzina]] competed as a team in ''[[The Amazing Race 31]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nOn the first night, twelve new HouseGuests entered the Big Brother House to two new twists of the season. The first twist was that four successful ex-HouseGuests would re-enter the House not to compete against one another, but to coach the new HouseGuests. Their job is to guide the HouseGuests for as long as they can, hoping to keep coaching a possible winner. The winner's coach would win a special $100,000 prize at the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, [[Dan Gheesling]] from ''[[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|Big Brother 10]]'', Britney Haynes from ''[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|Big Brother 12]]'', Mike \"Boogie\" Malin from ''[[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|Big Brother 2]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'', and [[Janelle Pierzina]] from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'' entered the House. On the second twist of the night, HouseGuests were informed that their status in the game were at risk. Because Big Brother sent the HouseGuests \"invitations\" to enter the House instead of a key, the HouseGuests had to earn their status in the first Head of Household competition as there were only eleven keys to be earned. Therefore, for the first time in ''Big Brother'' history, one HouseGuest would be evicted by the end of the first night. That night, Janelle and Britney forged an alliance after Dan and Boogie agreed to working together.\n\nBefore the HouseGuests competed in their first Head of Household competition, the coaches assigned their teammates. The coaches chose one by one and in order, Britney chose Shane, Willie, and JoJo; Mike chose Frank, Ian, and Jenn; Janelle chose Wil, Ashley, and Joe; and Dan chose Kara, Danielle, and Jodi. The HouseGuests other than the coaches competed in the first Head of Household competition. Each teammate had to jump across large moving mattresses to retrieve life-sized teddy bears (Upon the competition's completion, one of the HouseGuests, Frank, kept his teddy bear; calling him \"Teddy B\"). After twenty minutes, teams were allowed to substitute one teammate. Team Britney won the Head of Household competition, and Team Dan came in last place, giving Dan the responsibility to evict one of his players. On Day 1, Dan cast the sole vote to evict Jodi. Mike won the first coaches competition of the season called \"Big Brother Derby\" and won the power to grant one of his teammates immunity for the week: He chose Ian. The four coaches each had to choose one of their teammates to be a Have-Not for the week, with Ashley, Ian, Shane, and Danielle getting picked. Frank and Kara were nominated for eviction on Day 5. On Day 7, Shane won the Power of Veto competition, \"Loose Change\", which involved HouseGuests running around and trying to find coin props (one dollar coin, quarter and five cent coins). Once they find them they had to throw the coin props from a distance to a machine. Once they threw a total of $1.30 in coin props, they would win the Power of Veto. Shane decided to leave Willie's nominations the same. On Day 13, Kara was evicted in a 5 to 3 vote, leaving Danielle as Dan's only team member left. It was also revealed the winner of the next Coaches Competition would have the option of either saving one of his or her players or trading them with another player.\n\nFollowing Kara's eviction, Frank won the Head of Household competition, \"Big Brother Break-In\".  The HouseGuests had to determine whether a burglar that entered the house was guilty or not guilty of a certain crime. HouseGuests were eliminated by answering incorrectly. Janelle won the second coaches competition, \"Phat Stacks\", and chose to give Ashley immunity from the nominations. She also single-handedly chose the four Have-Nots for the week: Willie, Shane, JoJo, and Ian. On Day 14, Willie was [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|expelled]] from the house, after going on a rampage in which he threw pork rinds at Janelle, swore at the female HouseGuests, and headbutted Joe. Minutes later, JoJo and Shane were nominated for eviction. On Day 15, Shane won the ''Memory Chip'' Power of Veto competition, in which HouseGuests had to run around dressed as [[Tortilla chip|salsa chips]] and dive into different pools of salsa and find different menu items names and then they had to bring the names and put them in correct order in their menu as it is on a menu at which they could look at. The HouseGuest that got most of the names in the correct order in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. Shane removed himself from the block, and Frank then nominated Danielle for eviction. When JoJo and Shane were flirting in the have-not room one night, Ian told Danielle about this and thus, Danielle told Janelle's and Boogie's players. On Day 20, JoJo was evicted by a vote of 5 to 1, only receiving the vote of Shane.\n\nFollowing JoJo's eviction, Shane won the \"On Thin Ice\" HoH competition. The HouseGuests shot balls into a slotted end of an ice rink that had scores for each slot. Host [[Julie Chen]] then revealed to the viewers they could vote on whether or not the mentors should be allowed to enter the game. On Day 21, the HouseGuests went to the Big Brother Gym for their coaches competition \"Feel the Burn\". Their goal was to do as many exercises of a certain type. The coach who would do the least would be eliminated. When they were eliminated they had the chance to open a locker and possibly win something. Britney chose Ian and Joe as Have-Nots, Mike Boogie won $10,000 that he shared with Ian whom he gave $3,000 and Jenn who received $1,000. Dan had the opportunity to invite five people to a private sushi & cocktail party. He chose Boogie, Britney, Janelle, Shane & Danielle. Janelle won the Coaches Competition and saved Wil. Later that day, Shane nominated Ashley and Joe for eviction. Also on Day 21; Shane, Ashley, Joe, Wil, Danielle, and Frank had been chosen to compete in the Veto Competition. On Day 22, all had competed in ''The Juggler'' Veto Competition, where each HouseGuest had to roll back and forth two balls at the same time on two different ramps. If even one of the balls would fall, that person would be out. Shane won the Power of Veto for the third week in a row. On Day 24, Shane used the Power of Veto on Ashley, nominating Frank in her place. Before the live eviction took place on Day 27, Julie Chen announced that America has chosen to give the coaches the opportunity to play the game and stop coaching. If the coaches voted to become players, the eviction would be canceled and everyone would play in the HoH, including Shane. However, if the coaches chose to keep the game the same, the eviction would continue, but one evicted HouseGuest would return the following week. Julie Chen also announced that only one vote was required to reset the entire game. One by one, the coaches were called into the Diary Room whether to hit the \"Reset Button\" or not. Britney, Dan and Janelle chose to hit the button, while Mike Boogie did not. With the vote of 3\u20131, the coaches were reverted to HouseGuest status and Joe and Frank were spared eviction.\n\nAll hounded HouseGuests then began to participate in the \"[[Walking the plank|Walk the Plank]]\" HoH endurance competition, in which the HouseGuests had to hold on to a bar. If they fell from the plank, they would be eliminated. After a nearly four-hour battle, Danielle became the new HoH, outlasting Britney and Ian. On Day 28, Danielle nominated Frank and Wil for eviction. Danielle won the Power of Veto from the \"Field of Veto\" competition on Day 29. Later, Boogie made a huge pitch to Danielle by using the veto and backdoor his long-time rival Janelle. A few hours later, all 4 coaches came up to the HOH room and Boogie called out Janelle on her lies. So Dan made an offer to her, if Frank gets vetoed, then Joe goes up. But when Janelle refused to answer, Dan knew that the possibility of all 4 coaches working together has blown up and he has no choice but to accept Boogie's offer on backdooring Janelle. On Day 30, Britney, Dan, Danielle, Frank, Mike Boogie and Shane created the \"Silent Six\" alliance and conspired to backdoor Janelle. On Day 31, Danielle went through with the plan and used the Power of Veto on Wil and put up Janelle as a replacement nominee. On Day 34, Janelle was evicted by an 8 to 1 vote with Joe as her only vote and became the first returning HouseGuest to leave the show and also marking the first time Janelle has not reached the final three.\n\nFollowing Janelle's eviction, on Day 34, all HouseGuests, with the exception of Danielle as the outgoing HoH, competed in the \"[[Battle of the Bands|Big Brother Battle of the Bands]]\" HoH competition, in which Frank became the new Head of Household for the second time this season. On Day 35, all HouseGuests competed in the Have/Have Not competition ''E-Squeeze Me?'', except for Ashley who was having back spasms and could not compete. Frank played in her spot. Britney, Danielle, Joe and Shane became the Have Nots for the week, making this week the first week Ian is a Have. On Day 35, Frank nominated Joe and Wil for eviction. The next night, the HouseGuests competed in the Power of Veto competition, ''Birth of Zingbot'', which Frank won. Before the Veto meeting, Wil and Ashley came to Frank and made a pitch on backdooring Dan. But when Boogie heard about this from Frank, he said to Frank, \"If you put up Dan, then it's 8 versus 2 and it's game over for us.\" So at the veto meeting, Frank then decided to keep his nominations the same. On Day 41, Wil was evicted by a 6 to 2 vote.\n\nFollowing Wil's eviction, on Day 41, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Swamped\" Head of Household Competition. The first HouseGuest to fill up the HoH jug with liquid and release the cork would win. There were two other jugs as well. One was safety and the other was a choice between $10,000 or a Have Not Pass decided by the viewers voting for $10,000. Britney won safety, Mike Boogie won $10,000, and Shane won his second HoH competition and became the new Head of Household. After the HOH competition, Boogie told Ian his targets would be Britney and Shane for the future. But Ian went on to warn them about Boogie and Frank and they cannot be trusted anymore. On Day 42, Shane went against his \"Silent Six\" alliance in favor of his second alliance (The Quack Pack) by nominating Frank and Mike Boogie for eviction. After the nomination ceremony, Boogie and Frank were lashing at Dan believing he was the mastermind behind their nominations. But unbeknownst to them, their ally Ian was the \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" Frank then won his second straight Power of Veto in the [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|controversial]] Veto competition, ''The Candy Counter''. Frank then used the Veto to save himself from nominations and Shane chose to nominate Jenn as the replacement. On Day 48, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was a Double Eviction night. For the first of the two evictions, Mike Boogie was evicted by a vote of 5\u20132. During the double eviction, Ian won the \"Before or After\" HoH and immediately nominated Ashley and Frank for eviction. Frank then won his third straight Power of Veto of the season in \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Veto]]\" and took himself off the block. Ian named Joe as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second eviction, Ashley was evicted by a vote of 5\u20131 and became the first member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Boogie and Ashley's eviction, Frank became the new Head of Household and got to choose one HouseGuest to become the Have Not for the week. Frank decided to choose Dan. On Day 49, Frank was given an option to open Pandora's Box. Frank decided to open Pandora's Box and received a little over $3,000, but unleashed quarters in the backyard to play the skill crane game, containing a Golden Ball of Veto. Ian got the ball and won the veto, but in doing so he sacrificed his chance to play in the week's POV competition. Later that day, Frank chose to nominate Dan and Danielle for eviction. On Day 50, the HouseGuests (with the exception of host Ian, who had to sit out since he already had the Golden Ball of Veto, and Joe, who wasn't chosen) played in the Power of Veto competition [[Draw Something]], which was made after the app of the same name. Jenn won her first competition of the summer after Frank was disqualified from the competition for whispering an answer to Britney during her turn. On Day 51, in one of the greatest game moves in \"Big Brother\" history, Dan came up with a master plan to get himself off the block by hosting his own \"funeral\" after having 24 hours of solitary confinement to think on how he was going to get out of this mess. First, he gathered everyone in the living room and paid compliments to his fellow HouseGuests. He thanked Joe for teaching him how to be a good husband, called Shane the \"real\" Captain America, and told Jenn that she was the first lesbian he'd ever met and that he appreciated how much she has touched his heart. He bonded with Britney over their status as newlyweds praised Ian for making the experience of being in the Big Brother house more fun. To Frank, Dan said that he wanted to apologize one-on-one after the funeral about some things he had said. However, for Danielle, he said that he thought that she had similar qualities to Dan's closest friend and ally Memphis Garrett from Big Brother 10, but he found out that he was wrong. He said to her that \"You'll never earn my trust back, you know what you did, and in this game you are dead to me.\" Later, he managed to strike a final two deal with Frank, his nemesis in the house and exposed the Quack Pack to him, telling that Ian was responsible for Boogie's eviction, not Dan. They manage to strike a final two deal and proposed a new alliance with Jenn and Danielle. Following this, he did some damage control to Danielle about the \"funeral\" and said that it was all an act and he used her emotions just to get them further in the game. Then, he said that he wanted to work with Frank and Jenn along with her. Thus, the two then went to Jenn in hopes of her using the veto to remove Dan from the block. On Day 52, Ian decided not to use his veto, while Jenn went through with the plan and Britney was shockingly put up as the replacement nominee, completely blindsiding Ian and Britney. Later, Ian and Frank had a huge fight over him betraying Mike \"Boogie\" and also putting Frank up on the block with Ashley in exchange for Frank giving Ian $3,000 during the Coaches' Competition in week 3. On Day 55, Britney was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, only receiving the vote of Ian and became the second member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Britney's eviction on Day 55, the HouseGuests competed in an endurance HoH competition called \"[[Soak Up the Sun]]\". In the competition, players had to hold onto a rope as it moved around a sun on the ground. With 51% of the public Twitter poll cast during the live show, America voted the first HouseGuest to drop out to have a punishment over a reward. Joe, for being the first to drop, was given a [[hula hoop]] and was required to use it every time Big Brother sounded [[Reveille]]. It was revealed that 5 hours before the previous live show began, Ian tells Dan he wants to reunite the Quack Pack and to tell him that he's not mad at Dan for what he did this week, but his main concern is that Dan will try to work with Frank and Jenn along with Danielle. So after Ian talked to Dan, Dan told Shane about Ian's idea of reuniting the Quack Pack and he wants go all the way to final four with him, Ian and Danielle. Ian outlasted all the HouseGuests and won HoH less than two hours later. On Day 56, Pandora's Box was presented again and Ian opted to open it, releasing small presents (along with a new hammock for the backyard). Ian also received $1,000 in prize money. However, ''Big Brother 10'' and ''11''{{'}}s Jessie Godderz was also released into the house, replacing all of their junk food and snacks with healthy, organic food for the week. On Day 56, Ian nominated Frank and Jenn for eviction. On Day 57, Dan won the Power of Veto competition which featured the return of OTEV. On Day 59, Dan decided to return the favor to Jenn (who vetoed him last week) and used the Veto on her. Ian nominated Joe in her place. On Day 62, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was another double eviction night. For the first of two evictions, Frank was evicted by a vote of 3\u20131 and became the third member of the jury, with Jenn being the only voter to evict Joe. Immediately afterwards, Dan won the \"Make Your Case\" Head of Household competition after a tiebreaker question with Jenn and Danielle. A few minutes later, Dan nominated both Ian and Joe for eviction with Ian as Dan's main target. Ian then won the \"[[Swimming with Sharks]]\" Power of Veto competition and removed himself from the block. Dan named Danielle as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second double eviction, Joe was evicted by a vote of 3\u20130 and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Frank and Joe's eviction, Ian won the \"Memory Lane\" Head of Household competition, making this his third HoH win and tying him with Frank for the most HoH wins so far this season. On Day 63, Ian opened Pandora's Box thereby giving the other HouseGuests video messages from home while he talked to [[Rachel Reilly]] from ''Big Brother 12'' and ''13''. Later that day, Ian nominated Jenn and Shane for eviction. On Day 64, Shane won the Power of Veto and a prize. On Day 65, Shane and Danielle went on a luxury prize to the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastic Champions. On Day 66, Shane decided to use the Power of Veto to save himself from the block, and in return, Ian nominated Danielle as the replacement. On Day 68, Jenn was evicted by a vote of 2\u20130 and became the fifth member of the jury. On Day 68, Danielle won her second HoH competition of the season \"Photographic Memory\", and went on to nominate Dan and Ian for eviction. On Day 68, Danielle won the \"Atomic Veto\" competition, making it her second and final Veto of the season. After the veto competition, Dan asked Danielle to use the Veto on himself, to which Danielle would only agree if Dan would evict Ian and not Shane. On Day 69, Danielle used the Power of Veto on Dan, and was replaced by Shane. A few minutes later, the biggest blindside of the summer occurred as Dan chose to evict Shane, blindsiding Danielle and Shane. Shane became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Shane's eviction, Dan won the first part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" (similar to the \"King of The Jungle\" endurance HOH from season 10 in which Dan also won). On Day 71, Ian won the second part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Climb Time\". On Day 75, Ian won the third part of the final Head of Household, \"Jury Statements\" and became the final Head of Household of the season. Ian then evicted Danielle and chose Dan to take to the final two. The jury was allowed to ask questions to both Dan and Ian, who began to turn against each other. In the end, the jury voted for Ian to win the grand prize by a vote of 6 to 1 over Dan, with Danielle being the only person to vote for Dan. Before the finale ended, Julie Chen announced that Frank was the winner of the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize.\nIan Terry now has a record of 4 HOH wins, tying Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses both from Big Brother 17, Caleb Reynolds from Big Brother 16, Aaryn Gries from Big Brother 15, Rachel Reilly from Big Brother 13, Hayden Moss from Big Brother 12, Janelle Pierzina from Big Brother 7 and Drew Daniel from Big Brother 5.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

As the coach of the last-place team, Dan had to evict one member of his team on Day 1.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the first three weeks, the coaches participated in a competition that gave them the power to save or trade one of their players. In Week 2, the power of trading a player was introduced.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: Due to a violent outburst, Willie was expelled from the game by Big Brother on Day 14. Because Frank had not made nominations yet, Big Brother decided to allow the game to continue on as normal. In addition, Willie's expulsion prevented him from being a candidate for America's Favorite HouseGuest.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} Prior to the planned live eviction on Day 27, America voted to offer the coaches the opportunity to become HouseGuests and entering the main game. The coaches individually entered the Diary Room and were presented with a reset button. Pressing the button was acceptance of America's offer. If a coach did not press the button that meant declining the offer. \n** Had the button been pressed by at least one coach, the planned eviction would be cancelled and the game would reset - with the coaches becoming full HouseGuests and Shane becoming eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition. \n** If all the coaches declined the offer, the eviction would continue as planned, the game would not reset (with the coaches retaining coach status) and the previously evicted HouseGuests would be given the opportunity to re-enter the House. \nFollowing the coaches' decision, the game was reset. \n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the Head of Household competition, Big Brother tempted the HouseGuests with the option to either win $10,000 or receive immunity from being nominated for eviction that week. Britney was the first to complete the necessary number of laps to fill her immunity jug during the competition and earned safety, while Mike won $10,000 during the competition.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During Week 7 there were two Golden Powers of Veto. The first Veto was won by Ian as a result of Pandora's Box. Then, Jenn won the regular veto in the Veto competition. At the Veto Ceremony, Ian made his decision first as he won his veto earlier than Jenn - Ian opted not to use his veto, while Jenn chose to veto Dan's nomination.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: During the finale, the ''Jury of Seven'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=November 2019|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n{{POV-section|date=November 2019}}\n}}\nWillie was expelled from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone that he would do anything to get himself removed before the actual live eviction that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.\n\nOn Day 42, shortly after Shane made his nominations as Head of Household, he told Danielle that the production crew in the diary room explicitly told him not to put up Frank and Mike for nomination that week. However, both were nominated and were thus eligible for eviction that week. On Day 43, Frank drew a \"HouseGuest's Choice\" token during the player draw and when asked to draw again, as later confided to Boogie, he palmed the token. Many fans believe that this was a result of the production team's desire to keep Frank in the game. This led to an outrage within message boards, fans and viewers, causing many to doubt the authenticity of the show once more. The scandal also ran throughout the Big Brother House and caused tension between opposing HouseGuests, who were not allowed to discuss the situation. Allison Grodner did not comment on the scandal. A video of Frank talking to Boogie about the cheating was put on YouTube, but later removed by CBS for copyright purposes. Despite outcry from fans, the game continued on as normal. On Day 48, Mike was evicted from the game. Frank, when on the block, won the veto and later won HoH causing many forums to speculate that the competitions were rigged in Frank's favor. Despite controversy, the game progressed on regardless.\n\nOn Day 49, after winning the Golden Ball of Veto from the crane game, Ian alleged several times to various HouseGuests that some of the producers were attempting to manipulate his decision and threaten him in the Diary Room by supposedly telling Ian how the Ball of Veto will benefit him if he decided to use it. Although that did cause fans to question the Big Brother game, other HouseGuests from past seasons have stated that the producers always ask the HouseGuests to name pros and cons about evicting certain HouseGuests for the week and they also ask the HouseGuests how it will better their own personal game if they kept one HouseGuest in rather than the other and vice versa, it's been known (since Big Brother 2) that producers ask HouseGuests how evicting HouseGuests, using the PoV or a special power will benefit their game, but the outcome is not controlled by the producers as HouseGuests can quickly change their minds at the last second if needed to. From seasons 2 through 10 host Julie Chen during the live shows would then say, \"Let's take a look in the Diary Room where HouseGuests share their thoughts on the nominees as they cast their votes.\" and that's when the HouseGuests would share the pros and cons and explain what would and wouldn't benefit their own game.\n\n== Television ratings ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|+Key\n| {{dagger}}\n|Season high for that night of the week\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! class=\"sortable\" | Households<br />(rating/share)\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for breaking rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, [[Ian Terry]] won the season by a 6\u20131 vote over runner-up [[Dan Gheesling]].<ref>Patrick Gomez,[http://people.com/tv/big-brother-14-winner-revealed/], ''People Magazine''>, September 20, 2012.

If the Veto winner exercised the power, the Head of Household then nominated another HouseGuest for eviction.\n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the two nominees vote to evict one of the two nominees.<ref name=\"Guardian BBUK-UK\">{{Cite news |last=Pickard |first=Ann |title=Why is Big Brother so big in the US? |work=Guardian.co.uk |date=August 19, 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2009/aug/19/why-big-brother-big-us |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |location=London}}</ref> This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host Julie Chen.

It was also the first to have two vetos at one veto ceremony.\n\nIn a change from past seasons, four former HouseGuests from past seasons of ''Big Brother'' returned to coach the new HouseGuests during their time in the House. Each coach had to pick three of the new HouseGuests that they will guide throughout the entire game. When a HouseGuests wins Head of Household the coach of that Housemate will also gain their own private room adjacent to the Head of Household bedroom. The coaches compete in a new competition that replaces Have vs. Have-Not competition for the season. The winning coach is granted the power to give one of their players immunity for the week or to trade one of their players for a player from another team. Depending on the rules of the coach's competition, each coach then has to choose one of their own players to become a \"Have Not\" for the week or the winning coach has the opportunity of choosing all of the \"Have Nots\". HouseGuests that are chosen to be \"Have Nots\" for the week had to eat \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food restriction (chosen by the viewing public), take cold showers, and sleep on hard beds. The coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize and the $50,000 runner-up prize but instead were to be awarded a separate $100,000 prize if one of their chosen HouseGuests wins Big Brother. However, on Week 3, America voted to allow the coaches to vote whether to keep coaching or become HouseGuests. Three of four voted to reset the game, and all coaches earned HouseGuest status, now eligible to win the $500,000 grand prize.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n{{main|List of Big Brother 14 houseguests (U.S.)}}\n\nA total of sixteen HouseGuests will compete, the same number of HouseGuests competing in ''[[Big Brother 9 (U.S.)|Big Brother 9]]''.

However, unlike previous seasons where the returning players competed as regular HouseGuests, the veterans were tasked with coaching three of the new players. Upon entering the house, the coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize, and were instead competing to win a separate prize of $100,000, which would be awarded to the coach of the winning HouseGuest. However, after the July 26 live eviction episode, viewers were allowed to vote on whether or not to give the coaches the option of entering the game as regular players for the $500,000 prize. On August 2, America's Vote was revealed. The result was to offer the coaches the option of entering the game. Julie Chen revealed that each coach would be called into the Diary Room individually to cast their vote to keep coaching or not. Inside the diary room was a reset button, signifying the game's reset for the coaches. If at least one coach decides to reset, all coaches would earn HouseGuest status. A 3\u20131 vote brought the coaches into the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; \n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Age on entry\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Occupation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Residence\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Big Brother'' History\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Big Brother 14'' results\n|-\n!

He finished in 12th place. Jodi Rollins made a brief Cameo on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S. season)|first season]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Britney Haynes returned for ''[[Big Brother 20 (U.S. season)|Big Brother 20]]'' where she celebrated the engagement of two-time ''Big Brother'' houseguest Nicole Franzel and season 18 houseguest Victor Arroyo. Haynes and [[Janelle Pierzina]] competed as a team in ''[[The Amazing Race 31]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nOn the first night, twelve new HouseGuests entered the Big Brother House to two new twists of the season. The first twist was that four successful ex-HouseGuests would re-enter the House not to compete against one another, but to coach the new HouseGuests. Their job is to guide the HouseGuests for as long as they can, hoping to keep coaching a possible winner. The winner's coach would win a special $100,000 prize at the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, [[Dan Gheesling]] from ''[[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|Big Brother 10]]'', Britney Haynes from ''[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|Big Brother 12]]'', Mike \"Boogie\" Malin from ''[[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|Big Brother 2]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'', and [[Janelle Pierzina]] from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'' entered the House. On the second twist of the night, HouseGuests were informed that their status in the game were at risk. Because Big Brother sent the HouseGuests \"invitations\" to enter the House instead of a key, the HouseGuests had to earn their status in the first Head of Household competition as there were only eleven keys to be earned. Therefore, for the first time in ''Big Brother'' history, one HouseGuest would be evicted by the end of the first night. That night, Janelle and Britney forged an alliance after Dan and Boogie agreed to working together.\n\nBefore the HouseGuests competed in their first Head of Household competition, the coaches assigned their teammates. The coaches chose one by one and in order, Britney chose Shane, Willie, and JoJo; Mike chose Frank, Ian, and Jenn; Janelle chose Wil, Ashley, and Joe; and Dan chose Kara, Danielle, and Jodi. The HouseGuests other than the coaches competed in the first Head of Household competition. Each teammate had to jump across large moving mattresses to retrieve life-sized teddy bears (Upon the competition's completion, one of the HouseGuests, Frank, kept his teddy bear; calling him \"Teddy B\"). After twenty minutes, teams were allowed to substitute one teammate. Team Britney won the Head of Household competition, and Team Dan came in last place, giving Dan the responsibility to evict one of his players. On Day 1, Dan cast the sole vote to evict Jodi. Mike won the first coaches competition of the season called \"Big Brother Derby\" and won the power to grant one of his teammates immunity for the week: He chose Ian. The four coaches each had to choose one of their teammates to be a Have-Not for the week, with Ashley, Ian, Shane, and Danielle getting picked. Frank and Kara were nominated for eviction on Day 5. On Day 7, Shane won the Power of Veto competition, \"Loose Change\", which involved HouseGuests running around and trying to find coin props (one dollar coin, quarter and five cent coins). Once they find them they had to throw the coin props from a distance to a machine. Once they threw a total of $1.30 in coin props, they would win the Power of Veto. Shane decided to leave Willie's nominations the same. On Day 13, Kara was evicted in a 5 to 3 vote, leaving Danielle as Dan's only team member left. It was also revealed the winner of the next Coaches Competition would have the option of either saving one of his or her players or trading them with another player.\n\nFollowing Kara's eviction, Frank won the Head of Household competition, \"Big Brother Break-In\".  The HouseGuests had to determine whether a burglar that entered the house was guilty or not guilty of a certain crime. HouseGuests were eliminated by answering incorrectly. Janelle won the second coaches competition, \"Phat Stacks\", and chose to give Ashley immunity from the nominations. She also single-handedly chose the four Have-Nots for the week: Willie, Shane, JoJo, and Ian. On Day 14, Willie was [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|expelled]] from the house, after going on a rampage in which he threw pork rinds at Janelle, swore at the female HouseGuests, and headbutted Joe. Minutes later, JoJo and Shane were nominated for eviction. On Day 15, Shane won the ''Memory Chip'' Power of Veto competition, in which HouseGuests had to run around dressed as [[Tortilla chip|salsa chips]] and dive into different pools of salsa and find different menu items names and then they had to bring the names and put them in correct order in their menu as it is on a menu at which they could look at. The HouseGuest that got most of the names in the correct order in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. Shane removed himself from the block, and Frank then nominated Danielle for eviction. When JoJo and Shane were flirting in the have-not room one night, Ian told Danielle about this and thus, Danielle told Janelle's and Boogie's players. On Day 20, JoJo was evicted by a vote of 5 to 1, only receiving the vote of Shane.\n\nFollowing JoJo's eviction, Shane won the \"On Thin Ice\" HoH competition. The HouseGuests shot balls into a slotted end of an ice rink that had scores for each slot. Host [[Julie Chen]] then revealed to the viewers they could vote on whether or not the mentors should be allowed to enter the game. On Day 21, the HouseGuests went to the Big Brother Gym for their coaches competition \"Feel the Burn\". Their goal was to do as many exercises of a certain type. The coach who would do the least would be eliminated. When they were eliminated they had the chance to open a locker and possibly win something. Britney chose Ian and Joe as Have-Nots, Mike Boogie won $10,000 that he shared with Ian whom he gave $3,000 and Jenn who received $1,000. Dan had the opportunity to invite five people to a private sushi & cocktail party. He chose Boogie, Britney, Janelle, Shane & Danielle. Janelle won the Coaches Competition and saved Wil. Later that day, Shane nominated Ashley and Joe for eviction. Also on Day 21; Shane, Ashley, Joe, Wil, Danielle, and Frank had been chosen to compete in the Veto Competition. On Day 22, all had competed in ''The Juggler'' Veto Competition, where each HouseGuest had to roll back and forth two balls at the same time on two different ramps. If even one of the balls would fall, that person would be out. Shane won the Power of Veto for the third week in a row. On Day 24, Shane used the Power of Veto on Ashley, nominating Frank in her place. Before the live eviction took place on Day 27, Julie Chen announced that America has chosen to give the coaches the opportunity to play the game and stop coaching. If the coaches voted to become players, the eviction would be canceled and everyone would play in the HoH, including Shane. However, if the coaches chose to keep the game the same, the eviction would continue, but one evicted HouseGuest would return the following week. Julie Chen also announced that only one vote was required to reset the entire game. One by one, the coaches were called into the Diary Room whether to hit the \"Reset Button\" or not. Britney, Dan and Janelle chose to hit the button, while Mike Boogie did not. With the vote of 3\u20131, the coaches were reverted to HouseGuest status and Joe and Frank were spared eviction.\n\nAll hounded HouseGuests then began to participate in the \"[[Walking the plank|Walk the Plank]]\" HoH endurance competition, in which the HouseGuests had to hold on to a bar. If they fell from the plank, they would be eliminated. After a nearly four-hour battle, Danielle became the new HoH, outlasting Britney and Ian. On Day 28, Danielle nominated Frank and Wil for eviction. Danielle won the Power of Veto from the \"Field of Veto\" competition on Day 29. Later, Boogie made a huge pitch to Danielle by using the veto and backdoor his long-time rival Janelle. A few hours later, all 4 coaches came up to the HOH room and Boogie called out Janelle on her lies. So Dan made an offer to her, if Frank gets vetoed, then Joe goes up. But when Janelle refused to answer, Dan knew that the possibility of all 4 coaches working together has blown up and he has no choice but to accept Boogie's offer on backdooring Janelle. On Day 30, Britney, Dan, Danielle, Frank, Mike Boogie and Shane created the \"Silent Six\" alliance and conspired to backdoor Janelle. On Day 31, Danielle went through with the plan and used the Power of Veto on Wil and put up Janelle as a replacement nominee. On Day 34, Janelle was evicted by an 8 to 1 vote with Joe as her only vote and became the first returning HouseGuest to leave the show and also marking the first time Janelle has not reached the final three.\n\nFollowing Janelle's eviction, on Day 34, all HouseGuests, with the exception of Danielle as the outgoing HoH, competed in the \"[[Battle of the Bands|Big Brother Battle of the Bands]]\" HoH competition, in which Frank became the new Head of Household for the second time this season. On Day 35, all HouseGuests competed in the Have/Have Not competition ''E-Squeeze Me?'', except for Ashley who was having back spasms and could not compete. Frank played in her spot. Britney, Danielle, Joe and Shane became the Have Nots for the week, making this week the first week Ian is a Have. On Day 35, Frank nominated Joe and Wil for eviction. The next night, the HouseGuests competed in the Power of Veto competition, ''Birth of Zingbot'', which Frank won. Before the Veto meeting, Wil and Ashley came to Frank and made a pitch on backdooring Dan. But when Boogie heard about this from Frank, he said to Frank, \"If you put up Dan, then it's 8 versus 2 and it's game over for us.\" So at the veto meeting, Frank then decided to keep his nominations the same. On Day 41, Wil was evicted by a 6 to 2 vote.\n\nFollowing Wil's eviction, on Day 41, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Swamped\" Head of Household Competition. The first HouseGuest to fill up the HoH jug with liquid and release the cork would win. There were two other jugs as well. One was safety and the other was a choice between $10,000 or a Have Not Pass decided by the viewers voting for $10,000. Britney won safety, Mike Boogie won $10,000, and Shane won his second HoH competition and became the new Head of Household. After the HOH competition, Boogie told Ian his targets would be Britney and Shane for the future. But Ian went on to warn them about Boogie and Frank and they cannot be trusted anymore. On Day 42, Shane went against his \"Silent Six\" alliance in favor of his second alliance (The Quack Pack) by nominating Frank and Mike Boogie for eviction. After the nomination ceremony, Boogie and Frank were lashing at Dan believing he was the mastermind behind their nominations. But unbeknownst to them, their ally Ian was the \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" Frank then won his second straight Power of Veto in the [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|controversial]] Veto competition, ''The Candy Counter''. Frank then used the Veto to save himself from nominations and Shane chose to nominate Jenn as the replacement. On Day 48, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was a Double Eviction night. For the first of the two evictions, Mike Boogie was evicted by a vote of 5\u20132. During the double eviction, Ian won the \"Before or After\" HoH and immediately nominated Ashley and Frank for eviction. Frank then won his third straight Power of Veto of the season in \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Veto]]\" and took himself off the block. Ian named Joe as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second eviction, Ashley was evicted by a vote of 5\u20131 and became the first member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Boogie and Ashley's eviction, Frank became the new Head of Household and got to choose one HouseGuest to become the Have Not for the week. Frank decided to choose Dan. On Day 49, Frank was given an option to open Pandora's Box. Frank decided to open Pandora's Box and received a little over $3,000, but unleashed quarters in the backyard to play the skill crane game, containing a Golden Ball of Veto. Ian got the ball and won the veto, but in doing so he sacrificed his chance to play in the week's POV competition. Later that day, Frank chose to nominate Dan and Danielle for eviction. On Day 50, the HouseGuests (with the exception of host Ian, who had to sit out since he already had the Golden Ball of Veto, and Joe, who wasn't chosen) played in the Power of Veto competition [[Draw Something]], which was made after the app of the same name. Jenn won her first competition of the summer after Frank was disqualified from the competition for whispering an answer to Britney during her turn. On Day 51, in one of the greatest game moves in \"Big Brother\" history, Dan came up with a master plan to get himself off the block by hosting his own \"funeral\" after having 24 hours of solitary confinement to think on how he was going to get out of this mess. First, he gathered everyone in the living room and paid compliments to his fellow HouseGuests. He thanked Joe for teaching him how to be a good husband, called Shane the \"real\" Captain America, and told Jenn that she was the first lesbian he'd ever met and that he appreciated how much she has touched his heart. He bonded with Britney over their status as newlyweds praised Ian for making the experience of being in the Big Brother house more fun. To Frank, Dan said that he wanted to apologize one-on-one after the funeral about some things he had said. However, for Danielle, he said that he thought that she had similar qualities to Dan's closest friend and ally Memphis Garrett from Big Brother 10, but he found out that he was wrong. He said to her that \"You'll never earn my trust back, you know what you did, and in this game you are dead to me.\" Later, he managed to strike a final two deal with Frank, his nemesis in the house and exposed the Quack Pack to him, telling that Ian was responsible for Boogie's eviction, not Dan. They manage to strike a final two deal and proposed a new alliance with Jenn and Danielle. Following this, he did some damage control to Danielle about the \"funeral\" and said that it was all an act and he used her emotions just to get them further in the game. Then, he said that he wanted to work with Frank and Jenn along with her. Thus, the two then went to Jenn in hopes of her using the veto to remove Dan from the block. On Day 52, Ian decided not to use his veto, while Jenn went through with the plan and Britney was shockingly put up as the replacement nominee, completely blindsiding Ian and Britney. Later, Ian and Frank had a huge fight over him betraying Mike \"Boogie\" and also putting Frank up on the block with Ashley in exchange for Frank giving Ian $3,000 during the Coaches' Competition in week 3. On Day 55, Britney was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, only receiving the vote of Ian and became the second member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Britney's eviction on Day 55, the HouseGuests competed in an endurance HoH competition called \"[[Soak Up the Sun]]\". In the competition, players had to hold onto a rope as it moved around a sun on the ground. With 51% of the public Twitter poll cast during the live show, America voted the first HouseGuest to drop out to have a punishment over a reward. Joe, for being the first to drop, was given a [[hula hoop]] and was required to use it every time Big Brother sounded [[Reveille]]. It was revealed that 5 hours before the previous live show began, Ian tells Dan he wants to reunite the Quack Pack and to tell him that he's not mad at Dan for what he did this week, but his main concern is that Dan will try to work with Frank and Jenn along with Danielle. So after Ian talked to Dan, Dan told Shane about Ian's idea of reuniting the Quack Pack and he wants go all the way to final four with him, Ian and Danielle. Ian outlasted all the HouseGuests and won HoH less than two hours later. On Day 56, Pandora's Box was presented again and Ian opted to open it, releasing small presents (along with a new hammock for the backyard). Ian also received $1,000 in prize money. However, ''Big Brother 10'' and ''11''{{'}}s Jessie Godderz was also released into the house, replacing all of their junk food and snacks with healthy, organic food for the week. On Day 56, Ian nominated Frank and Jenn for eviction. On Day 57, Dan won the Power of Veto competition which featured the return of OTEV. On Day 59, Dan decided to return the favor to Jenn (who vetoed him last week) and used the Veto on her. Ian nominated Joe in her place. On Day 62, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was another double eviction night. For the first of two evictions, Frank was evicted by a vote of 3\u20131 and became the third member of the jury, with Jenn being the only voter to evict Joe. Immediately afterwards, Dan won the \"Make Your Case\" Head of Household competition after a tiebreaker question with Jenn and Danielle. A few minutes later, Dan nominated both Ian and Joe for eviction with Ian as Dan's main target. Ian then won the \"[[Swimming with Sharks]]\" Power of Veto competition and removed himself from the block. Dan named Danielle as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second double eviction, Joe was evicted by a vote of 3\u20130 and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Frank and Joe's eviction, Ian won the \"Memory Lane\" Head of Household competition, making this his third HoH win and tying him with Frank for the most HoH wins so far this season. On Day 63, Ian opened Pandora's Box thereby giving the other HouseGuests video messages from home while he talked to [[Rachel Reilly]] from ''Big Brother 12'' and ''13''. Later that day, Ian nominated Jenn and Shane for eviction. On Day 64, Shane won the Power of Veto and a prize. On Day 65, Shane and Danielle went on a luxury prize to the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastic Champions. On Day 66, Shane decided to use the Power of Veto to save himself from the block, and in return, Ian nominated Danielle as the replacement. On Day 68, Jenn was evicted by a vote of 2\u20130 and became the fifth member of the jury. On Day 68, Danielle won her second HoH competition of the season \"Photographic Memory\", and went on to nominate Dan and Ian for eviction. On Day 68, Danielle won the \"Atomic Veto\" competition, making it her second and final Veto of the season. After the veto competition, Dan asked Danielle to use the Veto on himself, to which Danielle would only agree if Dan would evict Ian and not Shane. On Day 69, Danielle used the Power of Veto on Dan, and was replaced by Shane. A few minutes later, the biggest blindside of the summer occurred as Dan chose to evict Shane, blindsiding Danielle and Shane. Shane became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Shane's eviction, Dan won the first part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" (similar to the \"King of The Jungle\" endurance HOH from season 10 in which Dan also won). On Day 71, Ian won the second part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Climb Time\". On Day 75, Ian won the third part of the final Head of Household, \"Jury Statements\" and became the final Head of Household of the season. Ian then evicted Danielle and chose Dan to take to the final two. The jury was allowed to ask questions to both Dan and Ian, who began to turn against each other. In the end, the jury voted for Ian to win the grand prize by a vote of 6 to 1 over Dan, with Danielle being the only person to vote for Dan. Before the finale ended, Julie Chen announced that Frank was the winner of the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize.\nIan Terry now has a record of 4 HOH wins, tying Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses both from Big Brother 17, Caleb Reynolds from Big Brother 16, Aaryn Gries from Big Brother 15, Rachel Reilly from Big Brother 13, Hayden Moss from Big Brother 12, Janelle Pierzina from Big Brother 7 and Drew Daniel from Big Brother 5.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

As the coach of the last-place team, Dan had to evict one member of his team on Day 1.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the first three weeks, the coaches participated in a competition that gave them the power to save or trade one of their players. In Week 2, the power of trading a player was introduced.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: Due to a violent outburst, Willie was expelled from the game by Big Brother on Day 14. Because Frank had not made nominations yet, Big Brother decided to allow the game to continue on as normal. In addition, Willie's expulsion prevented him from being a candidate for America's Favorite HouseGuest.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} Prior to the planned live eviction on Day 27, America voted to offer the coaches the opportunity to become HouseGuests and entering the main game. The coaches individually entered the Diary Room and were presented with a reset button. Pressing the button was acceptance of America's offer. If a coach did not press the button that meant declining the offer. \n** Had the button been pressed by at least one coach, the planned eviction would be cancelled and the game would reset - with the coaches becoming full HouseGuests and Shane becoming eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition. \n** If all the coaches declined the offer, the eviction would continue as planned, the game would not reset (with the coaches retaining coach status) and the previously evicted HouseGuests would be given the opportunity to re-enter the House. \nFollowing the coaches' decision, the game was reset. \n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the Head of Household competition, Big Brother tempted the HouseGuests with the option to either win $10,000 or receive immunity from being nominated for eviction that week. Britney was the first to complete the necessary number of laps to fill her immunity jug during the competition and earned safety, while Mike won $10,000 during the competition.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During Week 7 there were two Golden Powers of Veto. The first Veto was won by Ian as a result of Pandora's Box. Then, Jenn won the regular veto in the Veto competition. At the Veto Ceremony, Ian made his decision first as he won his veto earlier than Jenn - Ian opted not to use his veto, while Jenn chose to veto Dan's nomination.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: During the finale, the ''Jury of Seven'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=November 2019|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n{{POV-section|date=November 2019}}\n}}\nWillie was expelled from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone that he would do anything to get himself removed before the actual live eviction that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.\n\nOn Day 42, shortly after Shane made his nominations as Head of Household, he told Danielle that the production crew in the diary room explicitly told him not to put up Frank and Mike for nomination that week. However, both were nominated and were thus eligible for eviction that week. On Day 43, Frank drew a \"HouseGuest's Choice\" token during the player draw and when asked to draw again, as later confided to Boogie, he palmed the token. Many fans believe that this was a result of the production team's desire to keep Frank in the game. This led to an outrage within message boards, fans and viewers, causing many to doubt the authenticity of the show once more. The scandal also ran throughout the Big Brother House and caused tension between opposing HouseGuests, who were not allowed to discuss the situation. Allison Grodner did not comment on the scandal. A video of Frank talking to Boogie about the cheating was put on YouTube, but later removed by CBS for copyright purposes. Despite outcry from fans, the game continued on as normal. On Day 48, Mike was evicted from the game. Frank, when on the block, won the veto and later won HoH causing many forums to speculate that the competitions were rigged in Frank's favor. Despite controversy, the game progressed on regardless.\n\nOn Day 49, after winning the Golden Ball of Veto from the crane game, Ian alleged several times to various HouseGuests that some of the producers were attempting to manipulate his decision and threaten him in the Diary Room by supposedly telling Ian how the Ball of Veto will benefit him if he decided to use it. Although that did cause fans to question the Big Brother game, other HouseGuests from past seasons have stated that the producers always ask the HouseGuests to name pros and cons about evicting certain HouseGuests for the week and they also ask the HouseGuests how it will better their own personal game if they kept one HouseGuest in rather than the other and vice versa, it's been known (since Big Brother 2) that producers ask HouseGuests how evicting HouseGuests, using the PoV or a special power will benefit their game, but the outcome is not controlled by the producers as HouseGuests can quickly change their minds at the last second if needed to. From seasons 2 through 10 host Julie Chen during the live shows would then say, \"Let's take a look in the Diary Room where HouseGuests share their thoughts on the nominees as they cast their votes.\" and that's when the HouseGuests would share the pros and cons and explain what would and wouldn't benefit their own game.\n\n== Television ratings ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|+Key\n| {{dagger}}\n|Season high for that night of the week\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! class=\"sortable\" | Households<br />(rating/share)\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

Several Arab tribes attempted to fight him on the way, but were defeated.\n\nWhen news of the advance of Abraha's army came, the Arab tribes of the Quraysh, Banu Kinanah, [[Banu Khuza'a]] and Banu Hudhayl united in defense of the Ka\u2018bah. A man from the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. [[Abd_al-Muttalib|\u2018Abdul Muttalib]] told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he with some leading members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Ka\u2018bah. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\"\n\nThe reference to the story in [[Qur\u2019an]] is rather short. According to [[Sura]]h [[al-Fil]], the next day [as Abraha prepared to enter the city], a dark cloud of [[Restless flycatcher|small birds]] named '[[Ababil (mythology)|Ababil]]' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}) appeared. The birds carried [[Lava|small rocks]] in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like \"eaten straw\". However according to [[Muhammad Asad]] this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] translates the above mentioned verses as:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|(2)Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures (3) which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Message 8f The Quran, by Mohammad Asad, Surah 105:2-3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n|}\nMohammad Asad the words used in this verse, namely the \"stones of sijjil\", denote  \"a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid M. Asad, Commentary on Surah 102, see note 2|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Lit., \"with stones of sijjil\". As explained in note [114] on\u00a011:82, this latter term is synonymous with sijill, which signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something that has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase hijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree (Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the same expression in\u00a011:82).}}</ref> He further explains that this decree by god was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the \"stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\" were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever \"hasbah\" primarily means \"pelting [or smiting] with stones\" in the famous arabic dictionary ''al-Qamous'' (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633) by [[Fairuzabadi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As already mentioned in the introductory note, the particular chastisement to which the above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden epidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and Muhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted fever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land of the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word hasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies also typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with stones\" (Qamus)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Al-Qamus Al-Muhit by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Ja\u02bbq\u016bb al- F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The word ta'ir can denote any \"flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus)\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As regards the noun ta'ir (of which tayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes any \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition offers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying creatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on the other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the commentators are purely imaginary, they need not be seriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is correct, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or insects - may well have been the carriers of the infection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the nature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it was certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word - namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it brought to the distressed people of Mecca.}}</ref>\n\n==Shia==\nAccording to [[Hadith]], in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam [[Ali]] was born in the 30th year of the Elephant<ref>{{cite web |title=The birth of El Imam Ali related to the year of the elephant |url=http://balaghah.net/old/nahj-htm/eng/id/article/46.htm |website=balaghah.net |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> and died in AH&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Al-Islam|first1=Thiqatu|title=Al-Kafi|date=2015|publisher=Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9914308-6-4|page=457|edition=Second|url=http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027221543/http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\n== Other sources ==\nThis event is referred to in the Qur\u2019an, in [[Sura]]h 105, ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, \"The Elephant\"), and is discussed in its related [[tafsir]].\n\nSome scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE,<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped03espo_0/page/154 154]|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World: Libe-Sare|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L.

The birds carried [[Lava|small rocks]] in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like \"eaten straw\". However according to [[Muhammad Asad]] this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] translates the above mentioned verses as:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|(2)Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures (3) which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Message 8f The Quran, by Mohammad Asad, Surah 105:2-3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n|}\nMohammad Asad the words used in this verse, namely the \"stones of sijjil\", denote  \"a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid M. Asad, Commentary on Surah 102, see note 2|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Lit., \"with stones of sijjil\". As explained in note [114] on\u00a011:82, this latter term is synonymous with sijill, which signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something that has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase hijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree (Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the same expression in\u00a011:82).}}</ref> He further explains that this decree by god was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the \"stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\" were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever \"hasbah\" primarily means \"pelting [or smiting] with stones\" in the famous arabic dictionary ''al-Qamous'' (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633) by [[Fairuzabadi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As already mentioned in the introductory note, the particular chastisement to which the above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden epidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and Muhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted fever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land of the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word hasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies also typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with stones\" (Qamus)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Al-Qamus Al-Muhit by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Ja\u02bbq\u016bb al- F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The word ta'ir can denote any \"flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus)\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As regards the noun ta'ir (of which tayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes any \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition offers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying creatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on the other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the commentators are purely imaginary, they need not be seriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is correct, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or insects - may well have been the carriers of the infection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the nature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it was certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word - namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it brought to the distressed people of Mecca.}}</ref>\n\n==Shia==\nAccording to [[Hadith]], in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam [[Ali]] was born in the 30th year of the Elephant<ref>{{cite web |title=The birth of El Imam Ali related to the year of the elephant |url=http://balaghah.net/old/nahj-htm/eng/id/article/46.htm |website=balaghah.net |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> and died in AH&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Al-Islam|first1=Thiqatu|title=Al-Kafi|date=2015|publisher=Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9914308-6-4|page=457|edition=Second|url=http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027221543/http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\n== Other sources ==\nThis event is referred to in the Qur\u2019an, in [[Sura]]h 105, ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, \"The Elephant\"), and is discussed in its related [[tafsir]].\n\nSome scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE,<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped03espo_0/page/154 154]|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World: Libe-Sare|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L.

Meanwhile, Lucie starts her new job at Hulbert Logistics, an office in [[Telford]], believing that her travels with the Doctor were all a dream. The Doctor arrives at the office and restores Lucie's memories. She realises that this is the job she was meant to start before she was taken by the Time Lords. He decides to investigate and finds the staff working on military tactics. Lucie is fired from the job and is ejected from the office with another member of staff, Karen. The office is revealed to be the interior of a giant war machine on an alien planet, where they find a small group of other ex-employees.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor finds a dimensional corridor in the human resources department, which leads to an office on Earth run by a man called Hulbert, who explains that he helps aliens fight wars by brainwashing humans to run the war machines. Believing the Doctor to be his latest 'client', he takes him to a conference on the alien planet to demonstrate his company's effectiveness as the current targets of his corporations have been hunted to near extinction. Believing Hulbert's plans to be unjustified, the Doctor sabotages the conference's defensive systems, only to discover that the war is being fought against [[Cybermen]], who storm the conference room.\n\n'''Part 2'''\n\nHubert agrees to work with the Cybermen, against the Doctor's advice. The Doctor learns that these Cybermen are an earlier version of the Cybermen he will encounter on Telos, having not recognised the name of the planet. Lucie and the ex-employees meet the Headhunter, who explains she was hired by Hubert to track Lucie down in case a rival company was trying to reverse-engineer his brainwashing techniques. As she has no desire to see the Cybermen win, she agrees to help them.\n\nLucie returns to the office with the other ex-employees and regains control.  Meanwhile, the Cybermen have summoned the office as it has a 100% success record, and they also intend to use the dimensional corridor to invade Earth. The office attacks the Cybermen whilst Lucie sneaks out and rescues the Doctor. They re-enter the office where Lucie shows the Doctor a device which she found in the office, which he recognizes as a Quantum Crystalliser, a device which alters possible future timelines to ensure the best possible outcome for the user.  They both go in the TARDIS to talk to another Time Lord who explains that the war had been engineered by the [[Celestial Intervention Agency]] to try to eliminate the Cybermen.\n\nThe Time Lord also explains that the CIA predicted that Lucie would become a [[dictator]] who would interfere with mankind's progress, so they also used a Crystalliser to alter her past to prevent this, but eventually they had to pull her out of time into the TARDIS, as contact with another Crystalliser would lead to her timeline becoming dangerously unstable. Realising that the Time Lords have manipulated her life Lucie takes the Quantum Crystalliser and runs back to the office. The Doctor realises that the Time Lords mistook Lucie for Karen when they pulled her out of time due to them both having job interviews on the same day, and Karen is the one destined to become a dictator.\n\nThe Headhunter tries to talk Lucie into using the Quantum Crystalliser to get revenge on the Time Lords. The Doctor arrives and explains the situation to her. She gives him the Crystalliser, but is shocked when he gives it to the Cybermen. However, the Cyberman who uses it instantly suffers total systems failure and is killed. The Doctor explains that the Quantum Crystalliser has been programmed to ensure that the Cybermen are defeated, so he increases the range on it, causing all of the Cybermen to be killed, and rendering the device itself useless. Whilst the Time Lords return the office workers home and Karen decides to become the Headhunter's new assistant, the Doctor and Lucie leave to new adventures.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] \u2014 [[Paul McGann]]\n*[[Lucie Miller]] \u2014 [[Sheridan Smith]]\n*[[List of Doctor Who villains#Headhunter|Headhunter]] \u2014 Katarina Olsson\n*Hulbert \u2014 [[Roy Marsden]]\n*Straxus \u2014 [[Nickolas Grace]]\n*Jerry \u2014 [[Owen Brenman]]\n*[[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Karen|Karen]] \u2014 Louise Fullerton\n*Malcolm \u2014 Andrew Wisher\n*Cybermen \u2014 [[Nicholas Briggs]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal\n | date = 2006-10-11\n | title = Digital Doctor\n | journal = [[Doctor Who Magazine]]\n | issue = 374\n | pages = 6\n }}\n*{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/09/14/36379.shtml\n| title = Doctor Eight for BBC7\n| accessdate = 2006-09-18\n| date = 2006-09-14\n| work = BBC Doctor Who website\n| publisher = [[bbc.co.uk]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/17-Doctor-Who-Human-Resources-Part-1 Big Finish Productions \u2013 ''Human Resources'' Part 1]\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/18-Doctor-Who-Human-Resources-Part-2 Big Finish Productions \u2013 ''Human Resources'' Part 2]\n\n{{Eighth Doctor audios}}\n{{Cybermen audios}}\n{{Gallifrey stories}}\n\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor audio plays]]\n[[Category:Radio plays based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Cybermen audio plays]]\n[[Category:2007 audio plays]]\n[[Category:2007 radio dramas]]\n[[Category:Gallifrey audio plays]]\n", "text_old": "{{Notability|date=July 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2015}}\n{{Infobox audio drama\n|title=Human Resources\n|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]]\n|series=[[Doctor Who]]\n|range=''[[The Eighth Doctor Adventures (audio drama series)|Eighth Doctor Adventures]]''\n|number=1.7 & 1.8\n|featuring=[[Eighth Doctor]]<br>[[Lucie Miller]]\n|cover= Human Resources.jpg\n|writer=[[Eddie Robson]]\n|director=[[Nicholas Briggs]]\n|producer=\n|executive_producer=Nicholas Briggs\n|production_code=\n|set_between=''[[No More Lies (Doctor Who audio)|No More Lies]]'' and ''[[Dead London]]''\n|length=2 50-minute episodes\n|date=11 February 2007 and<br>18 February 2007\n|}}\n'''''Human Resources''''' is an [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio drama]] based on the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

She was born as Mary Jones in [[Ludlow]], [[Shropshire]], England, and stayed there throughout her childhood and early adulthood, marrying William Morgan on 25 June 1785 and having two children with him. In 1789, [[Hemp|hempen]] yarn stolen from a factory was discovered at the Morgans' house, resulting in the couple being sentenced to [[penal transportation]]. Although William was able to escape initially, Molly was transported to [[New South Wales]] as a convict with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] on the [[Neptune (1780 ship)|''Neptune'']], and William was eventually caught and transported as well. After working together for a while in Australia, William left Molly due to her flirting with other men.

Once back in England, she recovered her children and became a dressmaker in [[Plymouth]], marrying Thomas Mears in 1797.

In 1814, she was sentenced to seven years in jail for milking a stolen cow.

She married Thomas Hunt on 5 March 1822. She started a wine shanty on the land she was given at Wallis Plains and received a grant of additional land by the governor, [[Thomas Brisbane]], where she built the Angel Inn. By 1828, she was described as \"one of the largest landholders on the Hunter River\"{{sfn|Guilford|1967}} and had several features in New South Wales named after her. Morgan also aided other settlers several times, including donating money to help build a school, turning part of her home into a hospital, and riding to Sydney on behalf of convicts.

{"title_page": "Determinant", "text_new": "{{about|determinants in mathematics|determinants in epidemiology|Risk factor|determinants in immunology|Epitope}}\nIn [[linear algebra]], the '''determinant''' is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a [[square matrix]] and encodes certain properties of the [[Linear map|linear transformation]] described by the matrix.  The determinant of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is denoted {{math|det(''A'')}}, {{math|det ''A''}}, or {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}}. Geometrically, it can be viewed as the [[volume]] scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix. This is also the signed volume of the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] spanned by the column or row vectors of the matrix. The determinant is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping preserves or reverses the orientation of ''n''-space.\n\nIn the case of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix the determinant may be defined as\n:<math>\\begin{align}|A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b\\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix}=ad - bc .\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its determinant is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  |A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{vmatrix}\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ \\Box & e & f \\\\ \\Box & h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & \\Box & f \\\\ g & \\Box & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & e & \\Box \\\\ g & h & \\Box \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nEach determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix in this equation is called a [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}}.  This procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, the ''[[Laplace expansion|minor expansion formula]]''.\n\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the [[coefficient]]s in a [[system of linear equations]], and the determinant can be used to [[Cramer's rule|solve]] those equations, although other methods of solution are much more computationally efficient. In linear algebra, a matrix (with entries in a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is singular (not [[Inverse matrix|invertible]]) [[if and only if]] its determinant is zero. This leads to the use of determinants in defining the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix, whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In [[analytic geometry]], determinants express the signed ''n''-dimensional volumes of ''n''-dimensional parallelepipeds. This leads to the use of determinants in [[calculus]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] in the [[Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables|change of variables rule]] for integrals of functions of several variables. Determinants appear frequently in algebraic identities such as the [[Vandermonde identity]].\n\nDeterminants possess many algebraic properties. One of them is multiplicativity, namely that the determinant of a [[matrix multiplication|product of matrices]] is equal to the product of determinants. Special types of matrices have special determinants; for example, the determinant of an [[orthogonal matrix]] is always plus or minus one, and the determinant of a complex [[Hermitian matrix]] is always [[real number|real]].\n\n==Geometric meaning==\nIf an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[Real number|real]] matrix ''A'' is written in terms of its column vectors <math>A = [\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\mathbf{a}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{a}_n\\end{array}]</math> then \n:<math>\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_1, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_2, \\quad\n                                                         \\ldots, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_n. \n</math>\n\nThis means that <math>A</math> maps the unit [[Hypercube|''n''-cube]] to the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\ldots,  \\mathbf{a}_n,</math> the region <math>P = \\left\\{c_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\cdots + c_n\\mathbf{a}_n \\mid 0 \\leq c_i\\leq 1 \\ \\forall i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe determinant gives the [[orientation (vector space)|signed]] ''n''-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, <math>\\det(A) = \\pm \\text{vol}(P),</math> and hence describes more generally the ''n''-dimensional volume scaling factor of the [[linear transformation]] produced by ''A''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/determinants-volumes.html|title=Determinants and Volumes|author=|date=|website=textbooks.math.gatech.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully ''n''-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of ''A'' is less than ''n''. This [[Rank\u2013nullity theorem|means]] that ''A'' produces a linear transformation which is neither [[surjective function|onto]] nor [[Injective function|one-to-one]], and so is not invertible.\n\n== Definition ==\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a [[square matrix]] ''A'', i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns.  Perhaps the simplest way to express the determinant is by considering the elements in the top row and the respective [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]]; starting at the left, multiply the element by the minor, then subtract the product of the next element and its minor, and alternate adding and subtracting such products until all elements in the top row have been exhausted.  For example, here is the result for a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c & d\\\\ e & f & g & h\\\\ i & j & k & l\\\\ m & n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} =\n  a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} f & g & h\\\\ j & k & l\\\\ n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & g & h\\\\ i & k & l\\\\ m & o & p \\end{vmatrix} +\n    c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & h\\\\ i & j & l\\\\ m & n & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    d\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & g\\\\ i & j & k\\\\ m & n & o \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\nAnother way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix.  If we write an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'' in terms of its column vectors\n: <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a_j</math> are vectors of size ''n'', then the determinant of ''A'' is defined so that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & b a_j + c v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= b\\det(A) + c \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_j & a_{j+1} & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= -\\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_{j+1} & a_j & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det(I) &= 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' are scalars, ''v'' is any vector of size ''n'' and ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.  These equations say that the determinant is a linear function of each column, that interchanging adjacent columns reverses the sign of the determinant, and that the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. These properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar.  These suffice to uniquely calculate the determinant of any square matrix. Provided the underlying scalars form a field (more generally, a commutative ring with unity), the definition below shows that such a function exists, and it can be shown to be unique.<ref>[[Serge Lang]], ''Linear Algebra'', 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1971, pp 173, 191.</ref>\n\nEquivalently, the determinant can be expressed as a sum of products of entries of the matrix where each product has ''n'' terms and the coefficient of each product is \u22121 or 1 or 0 according to a given rule: it is a [[polynomial expression]] of the matrix entries. This expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix (an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix contributes [[Factorial|''n''!]] terms), so it will first be given explicitly for the case of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices and {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrices, followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices, which subsumes these two cases.\n\nAssume ''A'' is a square matrix with ''n'' rows and ''n'' columns, so that it can be written as\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe entries can be numbers or expressions (as happens when the determinant is used to define a [[characteristic polynomial]]); the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a [[Commutativity|commutative]] manner.\n\nThe determinant of ''A'' is denoted by det(''A''), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\n=== 2 \u00d7 2 matrices ===\n[[File:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors representing the parallelogram's sides.]]\nThe [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc.</math>\n\nIf the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix ''A'' can be used to represent two [[linear map]]s:  one that maps the [[standard basis]] vectors to the rows of ''A'', and one that maps them to the columns of ''A''.  In either case, the images of the basis vectors form a [[parallelogram]] that represents the image of the [[unit square]] under the mapping.  The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')}}, and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}, as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n\nThe absolute value of {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by ''A''. (The parallelogram formed by the columns of ''A'' is in general a different parallelogram, but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, the area will be the same.)\n\nThe absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the ''oriented area'' of the parallelogram. The oriented area is the same as the usual [[area (geometry)|area]], except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the [[identity matrix]]).\n\nTo show that {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors {{nowrap|1='''a''' = (''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|1='''b''' = (''c'', ''d'')}} representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}sin''\u03b8''}} for the angle ''\u03b8'' between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the [[sine]] this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the [[cosine]] of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. {{nowrap|1='''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup> = (\u2212''b'', ''a'')}}, so that {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup>{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}cos''\u03b8' ''}}, which can be determined by the pattern of the [[scalar product]] to be equal to {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}:\n\n: <math>\\text{Signed area} =\n  |\\boldsymbol{a}| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\sin\\theta = \\left|\\boldsymbol{a}^\\perp\\right| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\cos\\theta' =\n  \\begin{pmatrix} -b \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = ad - bc.\n</math>\n\nThus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by ''A''. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is [[Equiareal map|equi-areal]] and orientation-preserving.\n\nThe object known as the ''[[bivector]]'' is related to these ideas. In 2D, it can be interpreted as an ''oriented plane segment'' formed by imagining two vectors each with origin {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, and coordinates {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}. The bivector magnitude (denoted by {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') \u2227 (''c'', ''d'')}}) is the ''signed area'', which is also the determinant {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XghF70fqkY WildLinAlg episode 4], Norman J Wildberger, Univ. of New South Wales, 2010, lecture via youtube</ref>\n\n=== 3 \u00d7 3 matrices ===\n[[File:Determinant parallelepiped.svg|300px|right|thumb|The volume of this [[parallelepiped]] is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the rows constructed from the vectors r1, r2, and r3.]]\n\nThe [[Laplace expansion|Laplace formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix is\n\n:<math>\n   \\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\ d&e&f\\\\ g&h&i\\end{vmatrix} =\n  a\\begin{vmatrix}e&f\\\\ h&i\\end{vmatrix} - b\\begin{vmatrix}d&f\\\\ g&i\\end{vmatrix} + c\\begin{vmatrix}d&e\\\\ g&h\\end{vmatrix}\n</math>\n\nthis can be expanded out to give\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{vmatrix}\n    &= a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\\\\n    &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is the [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix.\n\n[[File:Sarrus rule.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''Sarrus's rule'': The determinant of the three columns on the left is the sum of the products along the solid diagonals minus the sum of the products along the dashed diagonals]]\n\nThe [[rule of Sarrus]] is a mnemonic for the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration.

The set of all such permutations (also known as the [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' elements) is denoted by S<sub>''n''</sub>. For each permutation ''\u03c3'', sgn(''\u03c3'') denotes the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of ''\u03c3'', a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by \u03c3 can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times, and \u22121 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges.\n\nIn any of the <math>n!</math> summands, the term\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma_i}</math>\n\nis notation for the product of the entries at positions {{nowrap|(''i'', \u03c3<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, where ''i'' ranges from 1 to ''n'':\n\n:<math>a_{1,\\sigma_1} \\cdot a_{2,\\sigma_2} \\cdots  a_{n,\\sigma_n}.</math>\n\nFor example, the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix ''A'' ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}) is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      &\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\sgn(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\sgn([1,2,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} + \\sgn([1,3,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} + \\sgn([2,1,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} +{} \\\\\n      &\\sgn([2,3,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\sgn([3,1,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} + \\sgn([3,2,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\[2pt]\n  ={} & a_{1,1}a_{2,2}a_{3,3} - a_{1,1}a_{2,3}a_{3,2} - a_{1,2}a_{2,1}a_{3,3} +\n        a_{1,2}a_{2,3}a_{3,1} + a_{1,3}a_{2,1}a_{3,2} - a_{1,3}a_{2,2}a_{3,1}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==== Levi-Civita symbol ====\nIt is sometimes useful to extend the Leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations, but all sequences of ''n'' indices in the  range {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}} occur, ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation. Thus the totally antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita symbol]] <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n}</math> extends the signature of a permutation, by setting <math>\\varepsilon_{\\sigma(1),\\cdots,\\sigma(n)} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> for any permutation ''\u03c3'' of ''n'', and <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n} = 0</math> when no permutation ''\u03c3'' exists such that <math>\\sigma(j) = i_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math> (or equivalently, whenever some pair of indices are equal).

This means that if the ''j''th column of a matrix <math>A</math> is written as a sum <math>\\mathbf a_j = \\mathbf v + \\mathbf w</math> of two [[column vector]]s, and all other columns are left unchanged, then the determinant of <math>A</math> is the sum of the determinants of the matrices obtained from <math>A</math> by replacing the ''j''th column by <math>\\mathbf v</math> (denoted <math>A_v</math>) and then by <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> (denoted <math>A_w</math>) (and a similar relation holds when writing a column as a scalar multiple of a column vector).\n#: <math>\\begin{align}\\det(A)\n  &= \\det([\\mathbf{a}_1|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_j|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_n]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v}|\\dots]) + \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det\\left(A_v\\right) + \\det\\left(A_w\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n# <li value=\"9\">If in a matrix, any row or column has all elements equal to zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an [[alternating form]]. This means that whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, or more generally some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a [[Linearly independent|linearly dependent]] set), its determinant is 0.\n\nProperties 1, 8 and 10 \u2014 which all follow from the Leibniz formula \u2014 completely characterize the determinant; in other words the determinant is the unique function from {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices to scalars that is ''n''-linear alternating in the columns, and takes the value 1 for the identity matrix (this characterization holds even if scalars are taken in any given [[commutative ring]]). To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a [[standard basis]] vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property&nbsp;9) or else \u00b11 (by properties 1 and&nbsp;12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. For matrices over non-commutative rings, properties 8 and 9 are incompatible for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 2}},<ref>In a non-commutative setting left-linearity (compatibility with left-multiplication by scalars) should be distinguished from right-linearity. Assuming linearity in the columns is taken to be left-linearity, one would have, for non-commuting scalars ''a'', ''b'':\n:<math>ab =\n  ab \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n   a \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n   b \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n  ba \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} = ba,\n</math>\n\na contradiction. There is no useful notion of multi-linear functions over a non-commutative ring.</ref> so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.\n\nProperty 2 above implies that properties for columns have their counterparts in terms of rows:\n# <li value=\"11\">Viewing an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix as being composed of ''n'' rows, the determinant is an ''n''-linear function.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an alternating form: whenever two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.\n# Interchanging any pair of columns or rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by&nbsp;\u22121. This follows from properties 8 and 10 (it is a general property of multilinear alternating maps). More generally, any permutation of the rows or columns multiplies the determinant by the [[parity of a permutation|sign]] of the permutation. By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> (equivalently each column as '''C'''<sub>''i''</sub>) and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of '''R'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''R'''<sub>''k''</sub> (or '''C'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''C'''<sub>''k''</sub>), where ''j'', ''k'' are two indices chosen from 1 to ''n'' for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} square matrix.\n# Adding a scalar multiple of one column to ''another'' column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property&nbsp;8 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property&nbsp;10. Similarly, adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.\n</li>\n\nProperty 5 says that the determinant on {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree ''n''. These properties can be used to facilitate the computation of determinants by simplifying the matrix to the point where the determinant can be determined immediately. Specifically, for matrices with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], properties 13 and 14 can be used to transform any matrix into a triangular matrix, whose determinant is given by property&nbsp;7; this is essentially the method of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nFor example, the determinant of\n\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 2 & -3 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 &  3 \\\\\n   2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\ncan be computed using the following matrices:\n:<math>\n  B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     2 & 0 & -1\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  D = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nHere, ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding \u22121/2\u00d7the first row to the second, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = det(''B'')}}. ''C'' is obtained from ''B'' by adding the first to the third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''C'') = det(''B'')}}. Finally, ''D'' is obtained from ''C'' by exchanging the second and third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''D'') = \u2212det(''C'')}}. The determinant of the (upper) triangular matrix ''D'' is the product of its entries on the [[main diagonal]]: {{nowrap|1=(\u22122) \u00b7 2 \u00b7 4.5 = \u221218}}. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = \u2212det(''D'') = +18}}.\n\n=== Schur complement ===\nThe following identity holds for a [[Schur complement]] of a square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n\nThe Schur complement arises as the result of performing a block [[Gaussian elimination]] by multiplying the matrix ''M'' from the right with a ''block lower triangular'' matrix\n:<math>L = \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHere ''I''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the ''p''&#xD7;''p'' [[identity matrix]]. After multiplication with the matrix ''L'', the Schur complement appears in the upper ''p''&#xD7;''p'' block. The product matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  ML &= \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & B \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n     &= \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}.\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nThat is, we have effected a Gaussian decomposition\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} A-BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe first and last matrices on the RHS have determinant unity,  so we have\n:<math>\\det\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} = \\det(D) \\cdot \\det\\left(A - BD^{-1} C\\right).</math>\n\nThis is Schur's determinant identity.\n\n=== Multiplicativity and matrix groups ===\nThe determinant of a [[matrix product]] of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:\n:<math>\\det(AB) = \\det (A) \\times \\det (B)</math>\n\nThus the determinant is a ''multiplicative map''. This property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique ''n''-linear alternating function of the columns with value&nbsp;1 on the identity matrix, since the function {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} that maps {{nowrap|''M'' \u21a6 det(''AM'')}} can easily be seen to be ''n''-linear and alternating in the columns of ''M'', and takes the value det(''A'') at the identity. The formula can be generalized  to (square) products of rectangular matrices, giving the [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]], which also provides an independent proof of the multiplicative property.\n\nThe determinant det(''A'') of a matrix ''A'' is non-zero if and only if ''A'' is invertible or, yet another equivalent statement, if its [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] equals the size of the matrix. If so, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by\n:<math>\\det\\left(A^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} = [\\det(A)]^{-1}</math>\n\nIn particular, products and inverses of matrices with determinant one still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size ''n'') form a group known as the [[special linear group]]. More generally, the word \"special\" indicates the subgroup of another [[matrix group]] of matrices of determinant one.

The minor ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is defined to be the determinant of the {{nowrap|(''n''\u22121) \u00d7 (''n''\u22121)}}-matrix that results from ''A'' by removing the ''i''th row and the ''j''th column. The expression {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''i''+''j''</sup> ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is known as a [[cofactor (linear algebra)|cofactor]]. The determinant of ''A'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>i</math>) <math>= \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>j</math>)\n\nCalculating det(''A'') by means of this formula is referred to as expanding the determinant along a row, the ''i''th row using the first form with fixed ''i'', or expanding along a column, using the second form with fixed ''j''. For example, the Laplace expansion of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n -1 & 1 &  3\\\\\n  2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nalong the second column ({{nowrap|1=''j'' = 2}} and the sum runs over ''i'') is given by,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\det(A) & = (-1)^{1+2}\\cdot 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-1&3\\\\ 2 &-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{2+2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\[4pt]\n2&-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{3+2}\\cdot 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\ -1&3\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot((-1)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot3)+1\\cdot((-2)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot(-3)) \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot(-5)+8 = 18.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHowever, Laplace expansion is efficient for small matrices only.\n\nThe [[adjugate matrix]] adj(''A'') is the transpose of the matrix consisting of the cofactors, i.e.,\n\n: <math>(\\operatorname{adj}(A))_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ji}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the adjugate matrix, Laplace's expansion can be written as <ref>\u00a7&nbsp;0.8.2 of R.

The determinant of a [[linear transformation]]\n:<math>T : V \\rightarrow V</math>\nfor some finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in ''V''. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for ''V'' and therefore only depends on the endomorphism ''T''.\n\n=== Exterior algebra ===\n{{See also|Exterior algebra#Linear algebra}}\n\nThe determinant of a linear transformation {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}} of an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the ''n''th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' of ''V''. ''T'' induces a linear map\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                \\Lambda^n T: \\Lambda^n V &\\rightarrow \\Lambda^n V \\\\\n  v_1 \\wedge v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n &\\mapsto T v_1 \\wedge T v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge T v_n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' is one-dimensional, the map \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>T is given by multiplying with some scalar. This scalar coincides with the determinant of ''T'', that is to say\n:<math>\\left(\\Lambda^n T\\right)\\left(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n\\right) = \\det(T) \\cdot v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n.</math>\n\nThis definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. In particular, for a square <math> n \\times n</math> matrix ''A'' whose columns are <math>\\mathbf{a_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{a_n} </math>, its determinant satisfies <math> \\mathbf{a_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{a_n} = \\det(A) \\cdot \\mathbf{e_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{e_n}</math>, where <math>\\{\\mathbf{e_1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{e_n}\\}</math> is the standard basis of <math> \\mathbb{R}^n </math>. This follows from the characterization of the determinant given above. For example, switching two columns changes the sign of the determinant; likewise, permuting the vectors in the exterior product {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}} to {{nowrap|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, say, also changes its sign.\n\nFor this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>(''V'') is sometimes also called the determinant of ''V'' and similarly for more involved objects such as [[vector bundle]]s or [[chain complex]]es of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms \u039b<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' with {{nowrap|''k'' < ''n''}}.\n\n=== Square matrices over commutative rings and abstract properties ===\nThe determinant can also be characterized as the unique function\n:<math>D: M_n(K) \\to K</math>\nfrom the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in a field ''K'' to that field satisfying the following three properties: first, ''D'' is an [[Multilinear map|''n''-linear]] function: considering all but one column of ''A'' fixed, the determinant is linear in the remaining column, that is\n:<math>D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, a v_i + b w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) = a D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, v_i, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) + b D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n)</math>\nfor any column vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>, and ''w'' and any scalars (elements of ''K'') ''a'' and ''b''. Second, ''D'' is an [[alternating form|alternating]] function: for any matrix ''A'' with two identical columns, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''A'') = 0}}. Finally, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''I''<sub>''n''</sub>) = 1}}, where ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the identity matrix.\n\nThis fact also implies that every other ''n''-linear alternating function {{nowrap|''F'': M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} satisfies\n:<math>F(M)=F(I)D(M).</math>\n\nThis definition can also be extended where ''K'' is a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', in which case a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is an [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]] in ''R''. For example, a matrix ''A'' with entries in '''Z''', the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or \u22121. Such a matrix is called [[unimodular matrix|unimodular]].\n\nThe determinant defines a mapping\n:<math>\\operatorname{GL}_n(R) \\rightarrow R^\\times, </math>\nbetween the group of invertible {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''R'' and the [[multiplicative group]] of units in ''R''. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a [[group homomorphism]]. Secondly, given a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' \u2192 ''S''}}, there is a map {{nowrap|''GL<sub>n</sub>(f)'': GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') \u2192 GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''S'')}} given by replacing all entries in ''R'' by their images under ''f''. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., given a matrix {{nowrap|1=''A'' = (''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>)}} with entries in ''R'', the identity\n:<math>f(\\det((a_{i,j}))) = \\det ((f(a_{i,j})))</math>\nholds. In other words, the following diagram commutes:\n\n:[[Image:Determinant as a natural transformation.svg|300px]]\n\nFor example, the determinant of the [[complex conjugate]] of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo&nbsp;''m'' of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo&nbsp;''m'' (the latter determinant being computed using [[modular arithmetic]]). In the language of [[category theory]], the determinant is a [[natural transformation]] between the two functors GL<sub>''n''</sub> and (\u22c5)<sup>\u00d7</sup> (see also [[Natural transformation#Determinant]]).<ref>{{Citation|last=Mac Lane|first=Saunders|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|volume=|pages=|year=1998|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics '''5'''|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-98403-8|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane|title-link=Categories for the Working Mathematician}}</ref> Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of [[algebraic group]]s, from the general linear group to the [[multiplicative group]],\n:<math>\\det: \\operatorname{GL}_n \\rightarrow \\mathbb G_m.</math>\n\n== Generalizations and related notions ==\n\n=== Infinite matrices ===\nFor matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. [[Functional analysis]] provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.\n\nThe [[Fredholm determinant]] defines the determinant for operators known as [[trace class operator]]s by an appropriate generalization of the formula\n:<math>\\det(I+A) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(\\log(I+A))). </math>\n\nAnother infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the [[functional determinant]].\n\n===Operators in von Neumann algebras===\nFor operators in a finite [[von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]], one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the [[Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant]] using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every [[State (functional analysis)#tracial state|tracial state]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]] there is a notion of Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant.\n\n=== Related notions for non-commutative rings ===\nFor square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as  the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero {{clarify span|text=bilinear form|explain=What exactly is meant by this term must be specified.  This statement is valid only if the bilinear form is required to be linear on the same side for both arguments; in contrast, Bourbaki defines a bilinear form B as having the property B(ax,yb) = aB(x,y)b, i.e., left-linear in the left argument and right-linear in the other.|date=October 2017}} with a [[Regular element (ring theory)|regular element]] of ''R'' as value on some pair of arguments implies that ''R'' is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably [[quasideterminant]]s and the [[Dieudonn\u00e9 determinant]]. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the ''q''-determinant on quantum groups, the [[Capelli determinant]] on Capelli matrices, and the [[Berezinian]] on [[supermatrices]]. [[Manin matrices]] form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements.\n\n=== Further variants ===\nDeterminants of matrices in [[superring]]s (that is, Z<sub>2</sub>-[[graded ring]]s) are known as [[Berezinian]]s or superdeterminants.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=sZ1-G4hQgIIC&pg=PA116&dq=Berezinian#v=onepage&q=Berezinian&f=false | title = Supersymmetry for mathematicians: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-8218-3574-6 | last1 = Varadarajan | first1 = V.

The [[immanant of a matrix|immanant]] generalizes both by introducing a [[character theory|character]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> in Leibniz's rule.\n\n== Calculation ==\nDeterminants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in [[numerical linear algebra]], where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques.<ref name=Trefethen>L. N. Trefethen and D. Bau, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JaPtxOytY7kC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=determinant&f=false Numerical Linear Algebra]'' (SIAM, 1997). e.g. in Lecture 1: \"... we mention that the determinant, though a convenient notion theoretically, rarely finds a useful role in numerical algorithms.\"</ref> [[Computational geometry]], however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.<ref>\nA survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for computing determinants and their advantages and disadvantages including results of performance tests, is included in\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Fisikopoulos | first1 = Vissarion\n | last2 = Pe\u00f1aranda | first2 = Luis\n | title = Faster geometric algorithms via dynamic determinant computation\n | journal = Computational Geometry\n | volume = 54\n | pages = 1\u201316\n | publisher = Elsevier B.

Both these approaches are extremely inefficient for large matrices, though, since the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is [[Big O notation|of order]] ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M''. For example, Leibniz's formula requires calculating ''n''! products. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.\n\n=== Decomposition methods ===\nGiven a matrix ''A'', some methods compute its determinant by writing ''A'' as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the [[LU decomposition]], the [[QR decomposition]] or the [[Cholesky decomposition]] (for [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]). These methods are of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), which is a significant improvement over O(''n''!)\n\nThe LU decomposition expresses ''A'' in terms of a lower triangular matrix ''L'', an upper triangular matrix ''U'' and a [[permutation matrix]] ''P'':\n:<math> A = PLU. </math>\nThe determinants of ''L'' and ''U'' can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries.  The determinant of ''P'' is just the sign <math>\\varepsilon</math> of the corresponding permutation (which is +1 for an even number of permutations and is \u22121 for an odd number of permutations). The determinant of ''A'' is then\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon \\det(L)\\cdot\\det(U). </math>\n\n(See [[determinant identities]].) Moreover, the decomposition can be chosen such that ''L'' is a [[unitriangular matrix]] and therefore has determinant&nbsp;1, in which case the formula further simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon\\det(U).</math>\n\n=== Further methods ===\nIf the determinant of ''A'' and the inverse of ''A'' have already been computed, the [[matrix determinant lemma]] allows rapid calculation of the determinant of {{nowrap|''A'' + ''uv''<sup>T</sup>}}, where ''u'' and ''v'' are column vectors.\n\nSince the definition of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to ''n''<sup>4</sup> exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz<ref>http://page.inf.fu-berlin.de/~rote/Papers/pdf/Division-free+algorithms.pdf</ref> is based on [[closed ordered walk]]s (short ''clow''). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm looks very much like an iterated product of triangular matrices.\n\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where {{nowrap|''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup>}} for some {{nowrap|''a'' > 2}}, then the determinant can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.\n\nAlgorithms can also be assessed according to their [[bit complexity]], i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the [[Gaussian elimination]] (or LU decomposition) method is of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first1 = Xin Gui\n  | last1 = Fang\n  | first2 = George\n  | last2 = Havas\n  | title = On the worst-case complexity of integer Gaussian elimination\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1997 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation\n  | conference = ISSAC '97\n  | pages = 28\u201331\n  | publisher = ACM\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States\n  | url = http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | doi = 10.1145/258726.258740\n  | isbn = 0-89791-875-4\n  | access-date = 2011-01-22\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807042828/http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2011-08-07\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref> The [[Bareiss Algorithm]], on the other hand, is an exact-division method based on [[Sylvester's determinant theorem|Sylvester's identity]] is also of order ''n''<sup>3</sup>, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times ''n''.<ref>{{citation|first=Erwin|last=Bareiss|title= Sylvester's Identity and Multistep Integer-Preserving Gaussian Elimination|pages=565\u2013578|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1968-22-103/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0.pdf|journal=Mathematics of Computation|year=1968|volume=22|issue=102|doi=10.2307/2004533|jstor=2004533}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, determinants were used long before matrices: originally, a determinant was defined as a property of a [[system of linear equations]]. \nThe determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero). \nIn this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). \nIn Europe, {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} determinants were considered by [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]] at the end of the 16th century and larger ones by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref name=\"Eves\">Eves, H: \"An Introduction to the History of Mathematics\", pages 405, 493\u2013494, Saunders College Publishing, 1990.</ref><ref>A Brief History of Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory : {{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910034016/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref><ref>Cajori, F.

Immediately following, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of [[elimination theory]]; he proved many special cases of general identities.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the [[theory of numbers]]. He introduced the word '''''determinant''''' (Laplace had used ''resultant''), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the [[discriminant]] of a [[algebraic form|quantic]]. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.\n\nThe next contributor of importance is [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet|Binet]] (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows, which for the special case of {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, [[Cauchy]] also presented one on the subject. (See [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]].) In this he used the word '''''determinant''''' in its present sense,<ref>The first use of the word \"determinant\" in the modern sense appeared in: Cauchy, Augustin-Louis \"Memoire sur les fonctions qui ne peuvent obtenir que deux valeurs \u00e9gales et des signes contraires par suite des transpositions oper\u00e9es entre les variables qu'elles renferment,\" which was first read at the Institute de France in Paris on November 30, 1812, and which was subsequently published in the ''Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique'', Cahier 17, Tome 10, pages 29\u2013112 (1815).</ref><ref>Origins of mathematical terms: http://jeff560.tripod.com/d.html</ref> summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref>History of matrices and determinants: http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html</ref> With him begins the theory in its generality.\n\nThe next important figure was [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]<ref name=\"Eves\" /> (from 1827). He early used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]], and in his memoirs in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called ''alternants''. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1839) and [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] began their work.<ref>The first use of vertical lines to denote a determinant appeared in: Cayley, Arthur \"On a theorem in the geometry of position,\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'', vol. 2, pages 267\u2013271 (1841).</ref><ref>History of matrix notation: http://jeff560.tripod.com/matrices.html</ref>\n\nThe study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by [[Lebesgue]], [[Otto Hesse|Hesse]], and Sylvester; [[persymmetric]] determinants by Sylvester and [[Hermann Hankel|Hankel]]; [[circulant]]s by [[Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan|Catalan]], [[William Spottiswoode|Spottiswoode]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and Scott; skew determinants and [[Pfaffian]]s, in connection with the theory of [[orthogonal transformation]], by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; [[Wronskian]]s (so called by [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Muir]]) by [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel|Christoffel]] and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]]; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]] by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by [[Trudi]]. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Linear independence ===\nAs mentioned above, the determinant of a matrix (with real or complex entries, say) is zero if and only if the column vectors (or the row vectors) of the matrix are linearly dependent. Thus, determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors. For example, given two linearly independent vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, a third vector ''v''<sub>3</sub> lies in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[Linear span|spanned]] by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of [[differential equation]]s: given ''n'' functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''), \u2026, ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') (supposed to be {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} times differentiable), the [[Wronskian]] is defined to be\n:<math>W(f_1, \\ldots, f_n)(x) =\n  \\begin{vmatrix}\n            f_1(x) &         f_2(x) & \\cdots &         f_n(x) \\\\\n           f_1'(x) &        f_2'(x) & \\cdots &        f_n'(x) \\\\\n            \\vdots &         \\vdots & \\ddots &         \\vdots \\\\\n    f_1^{(n-1)}(x) & f_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt is non-zero (for some ''x'') in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order ''n''\u22121 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of [[analytic function]]s, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See [[Wronskian#The Wronskian and linear independence|the Wronskian and linear independence]].\n\n=== Orientation of a basis ===\n{{Main|Orientation (vector space)}}\nThe determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every [[sequence]] of ''n'' vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an [[orthogonal matrix]] with entries in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> represents an [[orthonormal basis]] in [[Euclidean space]]. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the [[standard basis]]. If the determinant is +1, the basis has the same orientation. If it is \u22121, the basis has the opposite orientation.\n\nMore generally, if the determinant of ''A'' is positive, ''A'' represents an orientation-preserving [[linear transformation]] (if ''A'' is an orthogonal {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} or {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix, this is a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]), while if it is negative, ''A'' switches the orientation of the basis.\n\n=== Volume and Jacobian determinant ===\nAs pointed out above, the [[absolute value]] of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the linear map represented by the matrix ''A'', and ''S'' is any [[Lebesgue measure|measurable]] [[subset]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then the volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by {{abs|det(''A'')}} times the volume of ''S''. More generally, if the linear map {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} is represented by the {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'', then the ''n''-[[dimension]]al volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by:\n:<math>\\operatorname{volume}(f(S)) = \\sqrt{\\det\\left(A^\\textsf{T} A\\right)} \\times \\operatorname{volume}(S).</math>\n\nBy calculating the volume of the [[tetrahedron]] bounded by four points, they can be used to identify [[skew line]]s.

The determinant of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is denoted {{math|det(''A'')}}, {{math|det ''A''}}, or {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}}. Geometrically, it can be viewed as the [[volume]] scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix. This is also the signed volume of the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] spanned by the column or row vectors of the matrix. The determinant is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping preserves or reverses the orientation of ''n''-space.\n\nIn the case of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix the determinant may be defined as\n:<math>\\begin{align}|A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b\\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix}=ad - bc .\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its determinant is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  |A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{vmatrix}\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ \\Box & e & f \\\\ \\Box & h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & \\Box & f \\\\ g & \\Box & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & e & \\Box \\\\ g & h & \\Box \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nEach determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix in this equation is called a [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}}.  This procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, the ''[[Laplace expansion|minor expansion formula]]''.\n\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the [[coefficient]]s in a [[system of linear equations]], and the determinant can be used to [[Cramer's rule|solve]] those equations, although other methods of solution are much more computationally efficient. In linear algebra, a matrix (with entries in a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is singular (not [[Inverse matrix|invertible]]) [[if and only if]] its determinant is zero. This leads to the use of determinants in defining the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix, whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In [[analytic geometry]], determinants express the signed ''n''-dimensional volumes of ''n''-dimensional parallelepipeds. This leads to the use of determinants in [[calculus]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] in the [[Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables|change of variables rule]] for integrals of functions of several variables. Determinants appear frequently in algebraic identities such as the [[Vandermonde identity]].\n\nDeterminants possess many algebraic properties. One of them is multiplicativity, namely that the determinant of a [[matrix multiplication|product of matrices]] is equal to the product of determinants. Special types of matrices have special determinants; for example, the determinant of an [[orthogonal matrix]] is always plus or minus one, and the determinant of a complex [[Hermitian matrix]] is always [[real number|real]].\n\n==Geometric meaning==\nIf an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[Real number|real]] matrix ''A'' is written in terms of its column vectors <math>A = [\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\mathbf{a}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{a}_n\\end{array}]</math> then \n:<math>\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_1, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_2, \\quad\n                                                         \\ldots, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_n. \n</math>\n\nThis means that <math>A</math> maps the unit [[Hypercube|''n''-cube]] to the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\ldots,  \\mathbf{a}_n,</math> the region <math>P = \\left\\{c_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\cdots + c_n\\mathbf{a}_n \\mid 0 \\leq c_i\\leq 1 \\ \\forall i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe determinant gives the [[orientation (vector space)|signed]] ''n''-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, <math>\\det(A) = \\pm \\text{vol}(P),</math> and hence describes more generally the ''n''-dimensional volume scaling factor of the [[linear transformation]] produced by ''A''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/determinants-volumes.html|title=Determinants and Volumes|author=|date=|website=textbooks.math.gatech.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully ''n''-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of ''A'' is less than ''n''. This [[Rank\u2013nullity theorem|means]] that ''A'' produces a linear transformation which is neither [[surjective function|onto]] nor [[Injective function|one-to-one]], and so is not invertible.\n\n== Definition ==\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a [[square matrix]] ''A'', i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns.  Perhaps the simplest way to express the determinant is by considering the elements in the top row and the respective [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]]; starting at the left, multiply the element by the minor, then subtract the product of the next element and its minor, and alternate adding and subtracting such products until all elements in the top row have been exhausted.  For example, here is the result for a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c & d\\\\ e & f & g & h\\\\ i & j & k & l\\\\ m & n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} =\n  a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} f & g & h\\\\ j & k & l\\\\ n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & g & h\\\\ i & k & l\\\\ m & o & p \\end{vmatrix} +\n    c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & h\\\\ i & j & l\\\\ m & n & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    d\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & g\\\\ i & j & k\\\\ m & n & o \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\nAnother way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix.  If we write an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'' in terms of its column vectors\n: <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a_j</math> are vectors of size ''n'', then the determinant of ''A'' is defined so that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & b a_j + c v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= b\\det(A) + c \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_j & a_{j+1} & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= -\\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_{j+1} & a_j & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det(I) &= 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' are scalars, ''v'' is any vector of size ''n'' and ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.  These equations say that the determinant is a linear function of each column, that interchanging adjacent columns reverses the sign of the determinant, and that the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. These properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar.  These suffice to uniquely calculate the determinant of any square matrix. Provided the underlying scalars form a field (more generally, a commutative ring with unity), the definition below shows that such a function exists, and it can be shown to be unique.<ref>[[Serge Lang]], ''Linear Algebra'', 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1971, pp 173, 191.</ref>\n\nEquivalently, the determinant can be expressed as a sum of products of entries of the matrix where each product has ''n'' terms and the coefficient of each product is \u22121 or 1 or 0 according to a given rule: it is a [[polynomial expression]] of the matrix entries. This expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix (an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix contributes [[Factorial|''n''!]] terms), so it will first be given explicitly for the case of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices and {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrices, followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices, which subsumes these two cases.\n\nAssume ''A'' is a square matrix with ''n'' rows and ''n'' columns, so that it can be written as\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe entries can be numbers or expressions (as happens when the determinant is used to define a [[characteristic polynomial]]); the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a [[Commutativity|commutative]] manner.\n\nThe determinant of ''A'' is denoted by det(''A''), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\n=== 2 \u00d7 2 matrices ===\n[[File:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors representing the parallelogram's sides.]]\nThe [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc.</math>\n\nIf the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix ''A'' can be used to represent two [[linear map]]s:  one that maps the [[standard basis]] vectors to the rows of ''A'', and one that maps them to the columns of ''A''.  In either case, the images of the basis vectors form a [[parallelogram]] that represents the image of the [[unit square]] under the mapping.  The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')}}, and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}, as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n\nThe absolute value of {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by ''A''. (The parallelogram formed by the columns of ''A'' is in general a different parallelogram, but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, the area will be the same.)\n\nThe absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the ''oriented area'' of the parallelogram. The oriented area is the same as the usual [[area (geometry)|area]], except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the [[identity matrix]]).\n\nTo show that {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors {{nowrap|1='''a''' = (''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|1='''b''' = (''c'', ''d'')}} representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}sin''\u03b8''}} for the angle ''\u03b8'' between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the [[sine]] this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the [[cosine]] of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. {{nowrap|1='''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup> = (\u2212''b'', ''a'')}}, so that {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup>{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}cos''\u03b8' ''}}, which can be determined by the pattern of the [[scalar product]] to be equal to {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}:\n\n: <math>\\text{Signed area} =\n  |\\boldsymbol{a}| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\sin\\theta = \\left|\\boldsymbol{a}^\\perp\\right| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\cos\\theta' =\n  \\begin{pmatrix} -b \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = ad - bc.\n</math>\n\nThus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by ''A''. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is [[Equiareal map|equi-areal]] and orientation-preserving.\n\nThe object known as the ''[[bivector]]'' is related to these ideas. In 2D, it can be interpreted as an ''oriented plane segment'' formed by imagining two vectors each with origin {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, and coordinates {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}. The bivector magnitude (denoted by {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') \u2227 (''c'', ''d'')}}) is the ''signed area'', which is also the determinant {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XghF70fqkY WildLinAlg episode 4], Norman J Wildberger, Univ. of New South Wales, 2010, lecture via youtube</ref>\n\n=== 3 \u00d7 3 matrices ===\n[[File:Determinant parallelepiped.svg|300px|right|thumb|The volume of this [[parallelepiped]] is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the rows constructed from the vectors r1, r2, and r3.]]\n\nThe [[Laplace expansion|Laplace formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix is\n\n:<math>\n   \\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\ d&e&f\\\\ g&h&i\\end{vmatrix} =\n  a\\begin{vmatrix}e&f\\\\ h&i\\end{vmatrix} - b\\begin{vmatrix}d&f\\\\ g&i\\end{vmatrix} + c\\begin{vmatrix}d&e\\\\ g&h\\end{vmatrix}\n</math>\n\nthis can be expanded out to give\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{vmatrix}\n    &= a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\\\\n    &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is the [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix.\n\n[[File:Sarrus rule.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''Sarrus's rule'': The determinant of the three columns on the left is the sum of the products along the solid diagonals minus the sum of the products along the dashed diagonals]]\n\nThe [[rule of Sarrus]] is a mnemonic for the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration.

The value in the ''i''th position after the reordering ''\u03c3'' is denoted by ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. For example, for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, the original sequence 1, 2, 3 might be reordered to {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3'' = [2, 3, 1]}}, with {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub> = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub> = 3}}, and {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>3</sub> = 1}}.  The set of all such permutations (also known as the [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' elements) is denoted by S<sub>''n''</sub>. For each permutation ''\u03c3'', sgn(''\u03c3'') denotes the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of ''\u03c3'', a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by \u03c3 can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times, and \u22121 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges.\n\nIn any of the <math>n!</math> summands, the term\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma_i}</math>\n\nis notation for the product of the entries at positions {{nowrap|(''i'', \u03c3<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, where ''i'' ranges from 1 to ''n'':\n\n:<math>a_{1,\\sigma_1} \\cdot a_{2,\\sigma_2} \\cdots  a_{n,\\sigma_n}.</math>\n\nFor example, the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix ''A'' ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}) is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      &\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\sgn(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\sgn([1,2,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} + \\sgn([1,3,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} + \\sgn([2,1,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} +{} \\\\\n      &\\sgn([2,3,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\sgn([3,1,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} + \\sgn([3,2,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\[2pt]\n  ={} & a_{1,1}a_{2,2}a_{3,3} - a_{1,1}a_{2,3}a_{3,2} - a_{1,2}a_{2,1}a_{3,3} +\n        a_{1,2}a_{2,3}a_{3,1} + a_{1,3}a_{2,1}a_{3,2} - a_{1,3}a_{2,2}a_{3,1}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==== Levi-Civita symbol ====\nIt is sometimes useful to extend the Leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations, but all sequences of ''n'' indices in the  range {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}} occur, ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation. Thus the totally antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita symbol]] <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n}</math> extends the signature of a permutation, by setting <math>\\varepsilon_{\\sigma(1),\\cdots,\\sigma(n)} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> for any permutation ''\u03c3'' of ''n'', and <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n} = 0</math> when no permutation ''\u03c3'' exists such that <math>\\sigma(j) = i_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math> (or equivalently, whenever some pair of indices are equal). The determinant for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix can then be expressed using an ''n''-fold summation as\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n=1}^n \\varepsilon_{i_1\\cdots i_n} a_{1,i_1} \\cdots a_{n,i_n},</math>\n\nor using two epsilon symbols as\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\frac{1}{n!}\\sum\\varepsilon_{i_1\\cdots i_n} \\varepsilon_{j_1\\cdots j_n} a_{i_1 j_1} \\cdots a_{i_n j_n},</math>\n\nwhere now each ''i<sub>r</sub>'' and each ''j<sub>r</sub>'' should be summed over {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}}.\n\nHowever, through the use of tensor notation and the suppression of the summation symbol (Einstein's summation convention) we can obtain a much more compact expression of the determinant of the second order system of <math>n=3</math> dimensions, <math>a^m_n</math>;\n\n:<math>\\det(a^m_n)e_{rst} = e_{ijk}a_r^i a_s^j a_t^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>e_{rst}</math> and <math>e_{ijk}</math> represent 'e-systems' that take on the values 0, +1 and \u22121 given the number of permutations of <math>ijk</math> and <math>rst</math>.

This means that if the ''j''th column of a matrix <math>A</math> is written as a sum <math>\\mathbf a_j = \\mathbf v + \\mathbf w</math> of two [[column vector]]s, and all other columns are left unchanged, then the determinant of <math>A</math> is the sum of the determinants of the matrices obtained from <math>A</math> by replacing the ''j''th column by <math>\\mathbf v</math> (denoted <math>A_v</math>) and then by <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> (denoted <math>A_w</math>) (and a similar relation holds when writing a column as a scalar multiple of a column vector).\n#: <math>\\begin{align}\\det(A)\n  &= \\det([\\mathbf{a}_1|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_j|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_n]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v}|\\dots]) + \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det\\left(A_v\\right) + \\det\\left(A_w\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n# <li value=\"9\">If in a matrix, any row or column has all elements equal to zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an [[alternating form]]. This means that whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, or more generally some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a [[Linearly independent|linearly dependent]] set), its determinant is 0.\n\nProperties 1, 8 and 10 \u2014 which all follow from the Leibniz formula \u2014 completely characterize the determinant; in other words the determinant is the unique function from {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices to scalars that is ''n''-linear alternating in the columns, and takes the value 1 for the identity matrix (this characterization holds even if scalars are taken in any given [[commutative ring]]). To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a [[standard basis]] vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property&nbsp;9) or else \u00b11 (by properties 1 and&nbsp;12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. For matrices over non-commutative rings, properties 8 and 9 are incompatible for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 2}},<ref>In a non-commutative setting left-linearity (compatibility with left-multiplication by scalars) should be distinguished from right-linearity. Assuming linearity in the columns is taken to be left-linearity, one would have, for non-commuting scalars ''a'', ''b'':\n:<math>ab =\n  ab \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n   a \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n   b \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n  ba \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} = ba,\n</math>\n\na contradiction. There is no useful notion of multi-linear functions over a non-commutative ring.</ref> so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.\n\nProperty 2 above implies that properties for columns have their counterparts in terms of rows:\n# <li value=\"11\">Viewing an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix as being composed of ''n'' rows, the determinant is an ''n''-linear function.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an alternating form: whenever two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.\n# Interchanging any pair of columns or rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by&nbsp;\u22121. This follows from properties 8 and 10 (it is a general property of multilinear alternating maps). More generally, any permutation of the rows or columns multiplies the determinant by the [[parity of a permutation|sign]] of the permutation. By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> (equivalently each column as '''C'''<sub>''i''</sub>) and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of '''R'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''R'''<sub>''k''</sub> (or '''C'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''C'''<sub>''k''</sub>), where ''j'', ''k'' are two indices chosen from 1 to ''n'' for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} square matrix.\n# Adding a scalar multiple of one column to ''another'' column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property&nbsp;8 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property&nbsp;10. Similarly, adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.\n</li>\n\nProperty 5 says that the determinant on {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree ''n''. These properties can be used to facilitate the computation of determinants by simplifying the matrix to the point where the determinant can be determined immediately. Specifically, for matrices with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], properties 13 and 14 can be used to transform any matrix into a triangular matrix, whose determinant is given by property&nbsp;7; this is essentially the method of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nFor example, the determinant of\n\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 2 & -3 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 &  3 \\\\\n   2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\ncan be computed using the following matrices:\n:<math>\n  B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     2 & 0 & -1\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  D = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nHere, ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding \u22121/2\u00d7the first row to the second, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = det(''B'')}}. ''C'' is obtained from ''B'' by adding the first to the third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''C'') = det(''B'')}}. Finally, ''D'' is obtained from ''C'' by exchanging the second and third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''D'') = \u2212det(''C'')}}. The determinant of the (upper) triangular matrix ''D'' is the product of its entries on the [[main diagonal]]: {{nowrap|1=(\u22122) \u00b7 2 \u00b7 4.5 = \u221218}}. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = \u2212det(''D'') = +18}}.\n\n=== Schur complement ===\nThe following identity holds for a [[Schur complement]] of a square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n\nThe Schur complement arises as the result of performing a block [[Gaussian elimination]] by multiplying the matrix ''M'' from the right with a ''block lower triangular'' matrix\n:<math>L = \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHere ''I''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the ''p''&#xD7;''p'' [[identity matrix]]. After multiplication with the matrix ''L'', the Schur complement appears in the upper ''p''&#xD7;''p'' block. The product matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  ML &= \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & B \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n     &= \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}.\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nThat is, we have effected a Gaussian decomposition\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} A-BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe first and last matrices on the RHS have determinant unity,  so we have\n:<math>\\det\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} = \\det(D) \\cdot \\det\\left(A - BD^{-1} C\\right).</math>\n\nThis is Schur's determinant identity.\n\n=== Multiplicativity and matrix groups ===\nThe determinant of a [[matrix product]] of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:\n:<math>\\det(AB) = \\det (A) \\times \\det (B)</math>\n\nThus the determinant is a ''multiplicative map''. This property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique ''n''-linear alternating function of the columns with value&nbsp;1 on the identity matrix, since the function {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} that maps {{nowrap|''M'' \u21a6 det(''AM'')}} can easily be seen to be ''n''-linear and alternating in the columns of ''M'', and takes the value det(''A'') at the identity. The formula can be generalized  to (square) products of rectangular matrices, giving the [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]], which also provides an independent proof of the multiplicative property.\n\nThe determinant det(''A'') of a matrix ''A'' is non-zero if and only if ''A'' is invertible or, yet another equivalent statement, if its [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] equals the size of the matrix. If so, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by\n:<math>\\det\\left(A^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} = [\\det(A)]^{-1}</math>\n\nIn particular, products and inverses of matrices with determinant one still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size ''n'') form a group known as the [[special linear group]]. More generally, the word \"special\" indicates the subgroup of another [[matrix group]] of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the [[special orthogonal group]] (which if ''n'' is 2 or 3 consists of all [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]), and the [[special unitary group]].\n\n=== Laplace's formula and the adjugate matrix ===\n[[Laplace expansion|Laplace's formula]] expresses the determinant of a matrix in terms of its [[minor (matrix)|minors]]. The minor ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is defined to be the determinant of the {{nowrap|(''n''\u22121) \u00d7 (''n''\u22121)}}-matrix that results from ''A'' by removing the ''i''th row and the ''j''th column. The expression {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''i''+''j''</sup> ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is known as a [[cofactor (linear algebra)|cofactor]]. The determinant of ''A'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>i</math>) <math>= \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>j</math>)\n\nCalculating det(''A'') by means of this formula is referred to as expanding the determinant along a row, the ''i''th row using the first form with fixed ''i'', or expanding along a column, using the second form with fixed ''j''. For example, the Laplace expansion of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n -1 & 1 &  3\\\\\n  2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nalong the second column ({{nowrap|1=''j'' = 2}} and the sum runs over ''i'') is given by,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\det(A) & = (-1)^{1+2}\\cdot 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-1&3\\\\ 2 &-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{2+2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\[4pt]\n2&-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{3+2}\\cdot 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\ -1&3\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot((-1)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot3)+1\\cdot((-2)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot(-3)) \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot(-5)+8 = 18.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHowever, Laplace expansion is efficient for small matrices only.\n\nThe [[adjugate matrix]] adj(''A'') is the transpose of the matrix consisting of the cofactors, i.e.,\n\n: <math>(\\operatorname{adj}(A))_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ji}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the adjugate matrix, Laplace's expansion can be written as <ref>\u00a7&nbsp;0.8.2 of R.

Indeed, repeatedly applying the above identities yields\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\det(X)^{-1} \\det(B)\\det(X) = \\det(B) \\det(X)^{-1} \\det(X) = \\det(B).</math>\n\nThe determinant is therefore also called a [[similarity invariance|similarity invariant]]. The determinant of a [[linear transformation]]\n:<math>T : V \\rightarrow V</math>\nfor some finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in ''V''. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for ''V'' and therefore only depends on the endomorphism ''T''.\n\n=== Exterior algebra ===\n{{See also|Exterior algebra#Linear algebra}}\n\nThe determinant of a linear transformation {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}} of an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the ''n''th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' of ''V''. ''T'' induces a linear map\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                \\Lambda^n T: \\Lambda^n V &\\rightarrow \\Lambda^n V \\\\\n  v_1 \\wedge v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n &\\mapsto T v_1 \\wedge T v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge T v_n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' is one-dimensional, the map \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>T is given by multiplying with some scalar. This scalar coincides with the determinant of ''T'', that is to say\n:<math>\\left(\\Lambda^n T\\right)\\left(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n\\right) = \\det(T) \\cdot v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n.</math>\n\nThis definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. In particular, for a square <math> n \\times n</math> matrix ''A'' whose columns are <math>\\mathbf{a_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{a_n} </math>, its determinant satisfies <math> \\mathbf{a_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{a_n} = \\det(A) \\cdot \\mathbf{e_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{e_n}</math>, where <math>\\{\\mathbf{e_1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{e_n}\\}</math> is the standard basis of <math> \\mathbb{R}^n </math>. This follows from the characterization of the determinant given above. For example, switching two columns changes the sign of the determinant; likewise, permuting the vectors in the exterior product {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}} to {{nowrap|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, say, also changes its sign.\n\nFor this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>(''V'') is sometimes also called the determinant of ''V'' and similarly for more involved objects such as [[vector bundle]]s or [[chain complex]]es of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms \u039b<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' with {{nowrap|''k'' < ''n''}}.\n\n=== Square matrices over commutative rings and abstract properties ===\nThe determinant can also be characterized as the unique function\n:<math>D: M_n(K) \\to K</math>\nfrom the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in a field ''K'' to that field satisfying the following three properties: first, ''D'' is an [[Multilinear map|''n''-linear]] function: considering all but one column of ''A'' fixed, the determinant is linear in the remaining column, that is\n:<math>D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, a v_i + b w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) = a D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, v_i, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) + b D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n)</math>\nfor any column vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>, and ''w'' and any scalars (elements of ''K'') ''a'' and ''b''. Second, ''D'' is an [[alternating form|alternating]] function: for any matrix ''A'' with two identical columns, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''A'') = 0}}. Finally, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''I''<sub>''n''</sub>) = 1}}, where ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the identity matrix.\n\nThis fact also implies that every other ''n''-linear alternating function {{nowrap|''F'': M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} satisfies\n:<math>F(M)=F(I)D(M).</math>\n\nThis definition can also be extended where ''K'' is a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', in which case a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is an [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]] in ''R''. For example, a matrix ''A'' with entries in '''Z''', the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or \u22121. Such a matrix is called [[unimodular matrix|unimodular]].\n\nThe determinant defines a mapping\n:<math>\\operatorname{GL}_n(R) \\rightarrow R^\\times, </math>\nbetween the group of invertible {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''R'' and the [[multiplicative group]] of units in ''R''. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a [[group homomorphism]]. Secondly, given a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' \u2192 ''S''}}, there is a map {{nowrap|''GL<sub>n</sub>(f)'': GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') \u2192 GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''S'')}} given by replacing all entries in ''R'' by their images under ''f''. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., given a matrix {{nowrap|1=''A'' = (''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>)}} with entries in ''R'', the identity\n:<math>f(\\det((a_{i,j}))) = \\det ((f(a_{i,j})))</math>\nholds. In other words, the following diagram commutes:\n\n:[[Image:Determinant as a natural transformation.svg|300px]]\n\nFor example, the determinant of the [[complex conjugate]] of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo&nbsp;''m'' of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo&nbsp;''m'' (the latter determinant being computed using [[modular arithmetic]]). In the language of [[category theory]], the determinant is a [[natural transformation]] between the two functors GL<sub>''n''</sub> and (\u22c5)<sup>\u00d7</sup> (see also [[Natural transformation#Determinant]]).<ref>{{Citation|last=Mac Lane|first=Saunders|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|volume=|pages=|year=1998|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics '''5'''|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-98403-8|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane|title-link=Categories for the Working Mathematician}}</ref> Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of [[algebraic group]]s, from the general linear group to the [[multiplicative group]],\n:<math>\\det: \\operatorname{GL}_n \\rightarrow \\mathbb G_m.</math>\n\n== Generalizations and related notions ==\n\n=== Infinite matrices ===\nFor matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. [[Functional analysis]] provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.\n\nThe [[Fredholm determinant]] defines the determinant for operators known as [[trace class operator]]s by an appropriate generalization of the formula\n:<math>\\det(I+A) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(\\log(I+A))). </math>\n\nAnother infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the [[functional determinant]].\n\n===Operators in von Neumann algebras===\nFor operators in a finite [[von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]], one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the [[Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant]] using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every [[State (functional analysis)#tracial state|tracial state]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]] there is a notion of Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant.\n\n=== Related notions for non-commutative rings ===\nFor square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as  the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero {{clarify span|text=bilinear form|explain=What exactly is meant by this term must be specified.  This statement is valid only if the bilinear form is required to be linear on the same side for both arguments; in contrast, Bourbaki defines a bilinear form B as having the property B(ax,yb) = aB(x,y)b, i.e., left-linear in the left argument and right-linear in the other.|date=October 2017}} with a [[Regular element (ring theory)|regular element]] of ''R'' as value on some pair of arguments implies that ''R'' is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably [[quasideterminant]]s and the [[Dieudonn\u00e9 determinant]]. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the ''q''-determinant on quantum groups, the [[Capelli determinant]] on Capelli matrices, and the [[Berezinian]] on [[supermatrices]]. [[Manin matrices]] form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements.\n\n=== Further variants ===\nDeterminants of matrices in [[superring]]s (that is, Z<sub>2</sub>-[[graded ring]]s) are known as [[Berezinian]]s or superdeterminants.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=sZ1-G4hQgIIC&pg=PA116&dq=Berezinian#v=onepage&q=Berezinian&f=false | title = Supersymmetry for mathematicians: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-8218-3574-6 | last1 = Varadarajan | first1 = V.

The [[immanant of a matrix|immanant]] generalizes both by introducing a [[character theory|character]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> in Leibniz's rule.\n\n== Calculation ==\nDeterminants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in [[numerical linear algebra]], where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques.<ref name=Trefethen>L.

Bau, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JaPtxOytY7kC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=determinant&f=false Numerical Linear Algebra]'' (SIAM, 1997). e.g. in Lecture 1: \"... we mention that the determinant, though a convenient notion theoretically, rarely finds a useful role in numerical algorithms.\"</ref> [[Computational geometry]], however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.<ref>\nA survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for computing determinants and their advantages and disadvantages including results of performance tests, is included in\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Fisikopoulos | first1 = Vissarion\n | last2 = Pe\u00f1aranda | first2 = Luis\n | title = Faster geometric algorithms via dynamic determinant computation\n | journal = Computational Geometry\n | volume = 54\n | pages = 1\u201316\n | publisher = Elsevier B.

Both these approaches are extremely inefficient for large matrices, though, since the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is [[Big O notation|of order]] ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M''. For example, Leibniz's formula requires calculating ''n''! products. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.\n\n=== Decomposition methods ===\nGiven a matrix ''A'', some methods compute its determinant by writing ''A'' as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the [[LU decomposition]], the [[QR decomposition]] or the [[Cholesky decomposition]] (for [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]). These methods are of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), which is a significant improvement over O(''n''!)\n\nThe LU decomposition expresses ''A'' in terms of a lower triangular matrix ''L'', an upper triangular matrix ''U'' and a [[permutation matrix]] ''P'':\n:<math> A = PLU. </math>\nThe determinants of ''L'' and ''U'' can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries.  The determinant of ''P'' is just the sign <math>\\varepsilon</math> of the corresponding permutation (which is +1 for an even number of permutations and is \u22121 for an uneven number of permutations). The determinant of ''A'' is then\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon \\det(L)\\cdot\\det(U). </math>\n\n(See [[determinant identities]].) Moreover, the decomposition can be chosen such that ''L'' is a [[unitriangular matrix]] and therefore has determinant&nbsp;1, in which case the formula further simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon\\det(U).</math>\n\n=== Further methods ===\nIf the determinant of ''A'' and the inverse of ''A'' have already been computed, the [[matrix determinant lemma]] allows rapid calculation of the determinant of {{nowrap|''A'' + ''uv''<sup>T</sup>}}, where ''u'' and ''v'' are column vectors.\n\nSince the definition of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to ''n''<sup>4</sup> exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz<ref>http://page.inf.fu-berlin.de/~rote/Papers/pdf/Division-free+algorithms.pdf</ref> is based on [[closed ordered walk]]s (short ''clow''). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm looks very much like an iterated product of triangular matrices.\n\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where {{nowrap|''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup>}} for some {{nowrap|''a'' > 2}}, then the determinant can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.\n\nAlgorithms can also be assessed according to their [[bit complexity]], i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the [[Gaussian elimination]] (or LU decomposition) method is of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first1 = Xin Gui\n  | last1 = Fang\n  | first2 = George\n  | last2 = Havas\n  | title = On the worst-case complexity of integer Gaussian elimination\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1997 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation\n  | conference = ISSAC '97\n  | pages = 28\u201331\n  | publisher = ACM\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States\n  | url = http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | doi = 10.1145/258726.258740\n  | isbn = 0-89791-875-4\n  | access-date = 2011-01-22\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807042828/http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2011-08-07\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref> The [[Bareiss Algorithm]], on the other hand, is an exact-division method based on [[Sylvester's determinant theorem|Sylvester's identity]] is also of order ''n''<sup>3</sup>, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times ''n''.<ref>{{citation|first=Erwin|last=Bareiss|title= Sylvester's Identity and Multistep Integer-Preserving Gaussian Elimination|pages=565\u2013578|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1968-22-103/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0.pdf|journal=Mathematics of Computation|year=1968|volume=22|issue=102|doi=10.2307/2004533|jstor=2004533}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, determinants were used long before matrices: originally, a determinant was defined as a property of a [[system of linear equations]]. \nThe determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero). \nIn this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). \nIn Europe, {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} determinants were considered by [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]] at the end of the 16th century and larger ones by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref name=\"Eves\">Eves, H: \"An Introduction to the History of Mathematics\", pages 405, 493\u2013494, Saunders College Publishing, 1990.</ref><ref>A Brief History of Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory : {{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910034016/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref><ref>Cajori, F.

Immediately following, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of [[elimination theory]]; he proved many special cases of general identities.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the [[theory of numbers]]. He introduced the word '''''determinant''''' (Laplace had used ''resultant''), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the [[discriminant]] of a [[algebraic form|quantic]]. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.\n\nThe next contributor of importance is [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet|Binet]] (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows, which for the special case of {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, [[Cauchy]] also presented one on the subject. (See [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]].) In this he used the word '''''determinant''''' in its present sense,<ref>The first use of the word \"determinant\" in the modern sense appeared in: Cauchy, Augustin-Louis \"Memoire sur les fonctions qui ne peuvent obtenir que deux valeurs \u00e9gales et des signes contraires par suite des transpositions oper\u00e9es entre les variables qu'elles renferment,\" which was first read at the Institute de France in Paris on November 30, 1812, and which was subsequently published in the ''Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique'', Cahier 17, Tome 10, pages 29\u2013112 (1815).</ref><ref>Origins of mathematical terms: http://jeff560.tripod.com/d.html</ref> summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref>History of matrices and determinants: http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html</ref> With him begins the theory in its generality.\n\nThe next important figure was [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]<ref name=\"Eves\" /> (from 1827). He early used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]], and in his memoirs in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called ''alternants''. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1839) and [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] began their work.<ref>The first use of vertical lines to denote a determinant appeared in: Cayley, Arthur \"On a theorem in the geometry of position,\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'', vol. 2, pages 267\u2013271 (1841).</ref><ref>History of matrix notation: http://jeff560.tripod.com/matrices.html</ref>\n\nThe study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by [[Lebesgue]], [[Otto Hesse|Hesse]], and Sylvester; [[persymmetric]] determinants by Sylvester and [[Hermann Hankel|Hankel]]; [[circulant]]s by [[Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan|Catalan]], [[William Spottiswoode|Spottiswoode]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and Scott; skew determinants and [[Pfaffian]]s, in connection with the theory of [[orthogonal transformation]], by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; [[Wronskian]]s (so called by [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Muir]]) by [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel|Christoffel]] and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]]; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]] by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by [[Trudi]]. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Linear independence ===\nAs mentioned above, the determinant of a matrix (with real or complex entries, say) is zero if and only if the column vectors (or the row vectors) of the matrix are linearly dependent. Thus, determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors. For example, given two linearly independent vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, a third vector ''v''<sub>3</sub> lies in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[Linear span|spanned]] by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of [[differential equation]]s: given ''n'' functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''), \u2026, ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') (supposed to be {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} times differentiable), the [[Wronskian]] is defined to be\n:<math>W(f_1, \\ldots, f_n)(x) =\n  \\begin{vmatrix}\n            f_1(x) &         f_2(x) & \\cdots &         f_n(x) \\\\\n           f_1'(x) &        f_2'(x) & \\cdots &        f_n'(x) \\\\\n            \\vdots &         \\vdots & \\ddots &         \\vdots \\\\\n    f_1^{(n-1)}(x) & f_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt is non-zero (for some ''x'') in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order ''n''\u22121 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of [[analytic function]]s, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See [[Wronskian#The Wronskian and linear independence|the Wronskian and linear independence]].\n\n=== Orientation of a basis ===\n{{Main|Orientation (vector space)}}\nThe determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every [[sequence]] of ''n'' vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an [[orthogonal matrix]] with entries in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> represents an [[orthonormal basis]] in [[Euclidean space]]. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the [[standard basis]]. If the determinant is +1, the basis has the same orientation. If it is \u22121, the basis has the opposite orientation.\n\nMore generally, if the determinant of ''A'' is positive, ''A'' represents an orientation-preserving [[linear transformation]] (if ''A'' is an orthogonal {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} or {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix, this is a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]), while if it is negative, ''A'' switches the orientation of the basis.\n\n=== Volume and Jacobian determinant ===\nAs pointed out above, the [[absolute value]] of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the linear map represented by the matrix ''A'', and ''S'' is any [[Lebesgue measure|measurable]] [[subset]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then the volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by {{abs|det(''A'')}} times the volume of ''S''. More generally, if the linear map {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} is represented by the {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'', then the ''n''-[[dimension]]al volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by:\n:<math>\\operatorname{volume}(f(S)) = \\sqrt{\\det\\left(A^\\textsf{T} A\\right)} \\times \\operatorname{volume}(S).</math>\n\nBy calculating the volume of the [[tetrahedron]] bounded by four points, they can be used to identify [[skew line]]s.

The band has released three studio albums, one live album and one compilation album.\n\n== History ==\n[[Thorstein Elvestad]] and [[Bj\u00f8rn Nilsen (musiker)|Bj\u00f8rn Nilsen]] founded Jetsurfers in 1999. [[Vidar Fredsvik]] og [[Knut Carlsson]] joined the band soon after. Their EP, ''[[Jetsurfers - Saloon]]'', containing six tracks, were released by [[Coco Pelli Records]] the same year. Many of the bands gigs after that release were acoustic performances in prisons in the southern part of Norway.\n\nLate 2000, their first studio album, ''[[Jetlagged in Jetland]]'', were released at [[Grammofon AS Electra]]. The album got good reviews by Norwegian critics, and the songs were often played by radio stations all over [[Scandinavia]]. In May 2001, Carlsson was replaced by [[Audun Norgaard]] on bass. [[Lars Linkas]] replaced [[Vidar Fredsvik]] on guitar, early 2002.\n\n[[Grammofon AS Electra]] released their second studio album, ''[[Wildcards (album)|Wildcards]]'', in 2002. Their song \u00ab[[Fireworks]]\u00bb became a hit for many radio stations, and the band received good critics once again. The record company did a poor job promoting the album, so it did not sell as much as their debut. In the middle of 2003,  Jetsurfers played regularly at Muddy Waters in Oslo. They recorded the live album ''[[An Evening at Muddy Waters]]'' at this arena. The album sold well at their concerts and through their official web site.\n\n[[Lars Linkas]] left the band early in 2004, and was replaced by [[Cato Monrad]]. Monrad joined just in time for recording of new songs, and celebrating of Jetsurfers' five-year anniversary. He was replaced by [[Ulf H. Aass]] later that year. [[One Stop Entertainment]] released their compilation album ''[[Five Years Down the Road]]'' in Norge in July 2005. The albumet included new recordings and remastered versions of previously released songs. The songs on this album got much attention on radio stations across [[Europe]], because of a campaign done by [[Comstock Records]] (Arizona, US).\n\nJetsurfers has had a busy touring schedule over the years, playing over 500 gigs, even warming up for [[Mick Taylor]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[Hellbillies]] and [[Buddy Miller]]. They've also played a couple of Norwegian festivals. This busy schedule has made the band known as \u00abone of Norway's greatest live bands\u00bb. [[Perris Records]] and [[DWM Music Company]] distribute Jetsurfers' early records in the United States.\n\nIn 2007, [[Musikkoperat\u00f8rene]] released Jetsurfers' final album, ''[[Western Reality]]''. The band promoted the album by making appearances at Norwegian television.<ref>http://www.myspace.com/jetsurfers</ref>\n\n== Influences ==\nThe band has mentioned [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Georgia Satellites]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]] and [[Steve Earle]] as their influences.<ref>http://www.myspace.com/jetsurfers</ref>\n\n== Members ==\n'''Last members'''\n*[[Bj\u00f8rn Nilsen (musician)|Bj\u00f8rn Nilsen]] \u2013 [[Vocals]], [[guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[mandolin]]\n*[[Audun Norgaard]] \u2013 [[Bass guitar]], vocals\n*[[Ivar H.
