The majority of lines are connected to [[FTTC]] cabinets. However, due to the topology of the copper network, a small share of lines are also served directly from VDSL2 equipment located in local telephone exchange.\n* Description of service: The network supports multicasting for IPTV services and customers can be provided either with a standalone VDSL2 connection, or VDSL2 bundled with a [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] service. Most ISP's residential gateway devices contain a [[VoIP]] [[Analog telephone adapter|ATA]] which can be used to provide classic telephony services without using the legacy [[PSTN]] infrastructure.\n* Physical interface: Each [[Internet service provider|ISP provides]] its own [[Residential gateway|modem/access gateway]], to a standardised network interface specification. New VDSL2 installations require a site visit to install a NTU (Network Termination Unit) - a modular telephone socket with an optional integrated filter which is connected directly to the incoming line, ahead of any other internal wiring. This ensures optimal service by eliminating possible line noise or problematic internal wiring. It also provide a testable, demarcation point between the customer's internal wiring and the OpenEir network - and has an RJ11 test socket behind the face plate. For this reason, unlike ADSL services, self-installation is not available, unless a VDSL2 service was already in place. The filter plate installed on the NTU provides three connection terminals: an unfiltered socket for the VDSL2 modem (RJ45 socket that accepts an RJ11 plug), a filtered RJ11 socket for analogue telephone service and a filtered screw-down wiring terminal, located on the back of the faceplate, where extension sockets can be connected. The socket device also provides a range of wiring options for connecting monitored alarms and other specialist services.\n* VDSL2 providers: As OpenEir is a wholesale provider, ISP services are sold by a wide range of operators including (non-exhaustively): Airwire, BBnet, [[Digiweb]], [[eir (telecommunications)|Eir (retail arm)]], Fastcom, Host Ireland (Business broadband), IFA Telecom, Invertec, Lightnet, [[Magnet Networks]], Net1, Pure Telecom, Regional Broadband, Ripplecom, [[Sky Ireland]], Telcom, [[Three Ireland]], Viatel, [[Vodafone Ireland]], Westnet and Wireless Connect.

The majority of lines are connected to [[FTTC]] cabinets. However, due to the topology of the copper network, a small share of lines are also served directly from VDSL2 equipment located in local telephone exchange.\n* Description of service: The network supports multicasting for IPTV services and customers can be provided either with a standalone VDSL2 connection, or VDSL2 bundled with a [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] service. Most ISP's residential gateway devices contain a [[VoIP]] [[Analog telephone adapter|ATA]] which can be used to provide classic telephony services without using the legacy [[PSTN]] infrastructure.\n* Physical interface: Each [[Internet service provider|ISP provides]] its own [[Residential gateway|modem/access gateway]], to a standardised network interface specification. New VDSL2 installations require a site visit to install a NTU (Network Termination Unit) - a modular telephone socket with an optional integrated filter which is connected directly to the incoming line, ahead of any other internal wiring. This ensures optimal service by eliminating possible line noise or problematic internal wiring. It also provide a testable, demarcation point between the customer's internal wiring and the OpenEir network - and has an RJ11 test socket behind the face plate. For this reason, unlike ADSL services, self-installation is not available, unless a VDSL2 service was already in place. The filter plate installed on the NTU provides three connection terminals: an unfiltered socket for the VDSL2 modem (RJ45 socket that accepts an RJ11 plug), a filtered RJ11 socket for analogue telephone service and a filtered screw-down wiring terminal, located on the back of the faceplate, where extension sockets can be connected. The socket device also provides a range of wiring options for connecting monitored alarms and other specialist services.\n* VDSL2 providers: As OpenEir is a wholesale provider, ISP services are sold by a wide range of operators including (non-exhaustively): Airwire, BBnet, [[Digiweb]], [[eir (telecommunications)|Eir (retail arm)]], Fastcom, Host Ireland (Business broadband), IFA Telecom, Invertec, Lightnet, [[Magnet Networks]], Net1, Pure Telecom, Regional Broadband, Ripplecom, [[Sky Ireland]], Telcom, [[Three Ireland]], Viatel, [[Vodafone Ireland]], Westnet and Wireless Connect.

An act of God may amount to an exception to liability in contracts (as under the [[Hague\u2013Visby Rules]])<ref>Art. IV (2) \"Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from: ... (d) Act of God\"</ref> or it may be an \"insured peril\" in an [[insurance policy]].<ref>Marine Insurance Act 1906 - RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY</ref>\n\nBy contrast, other extraordinary man-made or political events  are deemed ''[[force majeure]]''.<ref>such as the closure of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway - ''The Bamburi'' [1982] I LLR3122</ref>\n\n== Contract law ==\nIn the law of [[contract]]s, an act of God may be interpreted as an implied defense under the rule of [[impossibility]] or [[impracticability]]. If so, the promise is discharged because of unforeseen occurrences, which were unavoidable and would result in insurmountable delay, expense, or other [[material breach]].\n\nUnder the English [[ common law]], contractual obligations were deemed sacrosanct, so failure to honour a contract could lead to an order for [[specific performance]] or internment in a [[debtor's prison]].  In 1863, this harsh rule was softened by the case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' which  introduced the doctrine of [[Frustration of purpose|frustration of contract]], which provided that \"where a contract becomes impossible to perform and neither party is at fault, both parties may be excused their obligations\".  In this case, a music hall was burned down by act of God before a contract of hire could be fulfilled, and the court deemed the contract frustrated.\n\nIn other contracts, such as [[Indemnity|indemnification]], an act of God may be no excuse, and in fact may be the central risk assumed by the promisor\u2014''e.g.,'' [[flood insurance]] or [[crop insurance]]\u2014the only variables being the timing and extent of the damage. In many cases, failure by way of ignoring obvious risks due to \"natural phenomena\" will not be sufficient to excuse performance of the obligation, even if the events are relatively rare: ''e.g.,'' the [[year 2000 problem]] in computers. Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], 2-615, failure to deliver goods sold may be excused by an \"act of God\" if the absence of such act was a \"basic assumption\" of the contract, and the act has made the delivery \"[[commercially impracticable]]\".\n\nRecently, human activities have been claimed to be the root causes of some events until now considered natural disasters. In particular:\n* [[Geothermal]] injections of water provoking earthquakes ([[Basel]], Switzerland, 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/beben-nach-erdwaermeprojekt-gericht-spricht-schweizer-geologen-frei-a-668549.html |title=Beben nach Erdw\u00e4rmeprojekt - Gericht spricht Schweizer Geologen frei |date=22 December 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Drilling]] provoking [[mud volcano]] ([[Java]], 2008)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/06/09_lusi.shtml |title=Javan mud volcano triggered by drilling, not quake |author2=Robert Sanders |first=Claire |last=Whitelaw |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuch events are possibly threatening the legal status of acts of God and may establish liabilities where none existed until now. Another issue in the law of contracts is whether the terms of contracts be complied upon in the case of an epidemic.\n\nAs a general principle of [[Act of God]]<ref>Gordon D. Kaufman Vol. 61, No. 2 (Apr., 1968), pp. 175-201 </ref> , [[epidemic]] can be classified as an [[act of God]] if the epidemic was unforeseeable and renders the promise discharged if the promisor cannot avoid the effect of the epidemic by exercise of reasonable prudence, diligence and care, or by the use of those means which the situation renders reasonable to employ<ref>Starr, Samuel M. Tony; Roy, Alyssa B.; Leonard, Kaitlyn C.; Prober, Clare. \"What the COVID-19 Pandemic Means for Force Majeure Provisions\". ''www.mintz.com''. Retrieved 2020-03-31.</ref>.\n\n== Tort law ==\n\n===UK \u2013 England and Wales===\n\nAn act of God is an unforeseeable natural phenomenon. Explained by [[John Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough|Lord Hobhouse]] in ''[[Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council]]'' as describing an event:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman\n| which involves no human agency\n| which is not realistically possible to guard against\n| which is due directly and exclusively to natural causes and\n| which could not have been prevented by any amount of foresight, plans, and care.}}\n\n===UK \u2013 Scotland===\n\nAn act of God is described in ''Tennant v. Earl of Glasgow'' (1864 2 M (HL) 22) as: \"Circumstances which no human foresight can provide against, and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility, and which when they do occur, therefore, are calamities that do not involve the obligation of paying for the consequences that may result from them.\"\n\n===United States===\nIn the law of [[tort]]s, an ''act of God'' may be asserted as a type of intervening cause, the lack of which would have avoided the cause or diminished the result of liability (e.g., but for the earthquake, the old, poorly constructed building would be standing). However, foreseeable results of unforeseeable causes may still raise liability. For example, a bolt of lightning strikes a ship carrying volatile compressed gas, resulting in the expected explosion. Liability may be found if the carrier did not use [[duty of care|reasonable care]] to protect against sparks\u2014regardless of their origins. Similarly, [[strict liability]] could defeat a defense for an ''act of God'' where the defendant has created the conditions under which any accident would result in harm. For example, a long-haul truck driver takes a shortcut on a back road and the load is lost when the road is destroyed in an unforeseen flood. Other cases find that a common carrier is not liable for the unforeseeable forces of nature. See e.g. Memphis & Charlestown RR Co. v. Reeves, 77 U.S. 176 (1870).\n\nA particularly interesting example is that of \"rainmaker\" [[Charles Hatfield]], who was hired in 1915 by the city of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to fill the Morena reservoir to capacity with rainwater for $10,000. The region was soon flooded by heavy rains, nearly bursting the reservoir's dam, killing nearly 20 people, destroying 110 bridges (leaving 2), knocking out [[telephone]] and [[telegraph]] lines, and causing an estimated $3.5 million in damage in total. When the city refused to pay him (he had forgotten to sign the contract), he sued the city. The floods were ruled an act of God, excluding him from liability but also from payment.\n\n==In theology==\n{{See also|Divine providence}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 059.png|thumb|right|In ''Korah's Rebellion'', an 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], a sinkhole forms under the rebels.]]\nThe phrase \"act of God\" is sometimes used to attribute an event to divine intervention.

An act of God may amount to an exception to liability in contracts (as under the [[Hague\u2013Visby Rules]])<ref>Art. IV (2) \"Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from: ... (d) Act of God\"</ref> or it may be an \"insured peril\" in an [[insurance policy]].<ref>Marine Insurance Act 1906 - RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY</ref>\n\nBy contrast, other extraordinary man-made or political events  are deemed ''[[force majeure]]''.<ref>such as the closure of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway - ''The Bamburi'' [1982] I LLR3122</ref>\n\n== Contract law ==\nIn the law of [[contract]]s, an act of God may be interpreted as an implied defense under the rule of [[impossibility]] or [[impracticability]]. If so, the promise is discharged because of unforeseen occurrences, which were unavoidable and would result in insurmountable delay, expense, or other [[material breach]].\n\nUnder the English [[ common law]], contractual obligations were deemed sacrosanct, so failure to honour a contract could lead to an order for [[specific performance]] or internment in a [[debtor's prison]].  In 1863, this harsh rule was softened by the case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' which  introduced the doctrine of [[Frustration of purpose|frustration of contract]], which provided that \"where a contract becomes impossible to perform and neither party is at fault, both parties may be excused their obligations\".  In this case, a music hall was burned down by act of God before a contract of hire could be fulfilled, and the court deemed the contract frustrated.\n\nIn other contracts, such as [[Indemnity|indemnification]], an act of God may be no excuse, and in fact may be the central risk assumed by the promisor\u2014''e.g.,'' [[flood insurance]] or [[crop insurance]]\u2014the only variables being the timing and extent of the damage. In many cases, failure by way of ignoring obvious risks due to \"natural phenomena\" will not be sufficient to excuse performance of the obligation, even if the events are relatively rare: ''e.g.,'' the [[year 2000 problem]] in computers. Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], 2-615, failure to deliver goods sold may be excused by an \"act of God\" if the absence of such act was a \"basic assumption\" of the contract, and the act has made the delivery \"[[commercially impracticable]]\".\n\nRecently, human activities have been claimed to be the root causes of some events until now considered natural disasters. In particular:\n* [[Geothermal]] injections of water provoking earthquakes ([[Basel]], Switzerland, 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/beben-nach-erdwaermeprojekt-gericht-spricht-schweizer-geologen-frei-a-668549.html |title=Beben nach Erdw\u00e4rmeprojekt - Gericht spricht Schweizer Geologen frei |date=22 December 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Drilling]] provoking [[mud volcano]] ([[Java]], 2008)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/06/09_lusi.shtml |title=Javan mud volcano triggered by drilling, not quake |author2=Robert Sanders |first=Claire |last=Whitelaw |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nSuch events are possibly threatening the legal status of acts of God and may establish liabilities where none existed until now.\n\n== Tort law ==\n\n===UK \u2013 England and Wales===\n\nAn act of God is an unforeseeable natural phenomenon. Explained by [[John Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough|Lord Hobhouse]] in ''[[Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council]]'' as describing an event:\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman\n| which involves no human agency\n| which is not realistically possible to guard against\n| which is due directly and exclusively to natural causes and\n| which could not have been prevented by any amount of foresight, plans, and care.}}\n\n===UK \u2013 Scotland===\n\nAn act of God is described in ''Tennant v. Earl of Glasgow'' (1864 2 M (HL) 22) as: \"Circumstances which no human foresight can provide against, and of which human prudence is not bound to recognize the possibility, and which when they do occur, therefore, are calamities that do not involve the obligation of paying for the consequences that may result from them.\"\n\n===United States===\nIn the law of [[tort]]s, an ''act of God'' may be asserted as a type of intervening cause, the lack of which would have avoided the cause or diminished the result of liability (e.g., but for the earthquake, the old, poorly constructed building would be standing). However, foreseeable results of unforeseeable causes may still raise liability. For example, a bolt of lightning strikes a ship carrying volatile compressed gas, resulting in the expected explosion. Liability may be found if the carrier did not use [[duty of care|reasonable care]] to protect against sparks\u2014regardless of their origins. Similarly, [[strict liability]] could defeat a defense for an ''act of God'' where the defendant has created the conditions under which any accident would result in harm. For example, a long-haul truck driver takes a shortcut on a back road and the load is lost when the road is destroyed in an unforeseen flood. Other cases find that a common carrier is not liable for the unforeseeable forces of nature. See e.g. Memphis & Charlestown RR Co. v. Reeves, 77 U.S. 176 (1870).\n\nA particularly interesting example is that of \"rainmaker\" [[Charles Hatfield]], who was hired in 1915 by the city of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to fill the Morena reservoir to capacity with rainwater for $10,000. The region was soon flooded by heavy rains, nearly bursting the reservoir's dam, killing nearly 20 people, destroying 110 bridges (leaving 2), knocking out [[telephone]] and [[telegraph]] lines, and causing an estimated $3.5 million in damage in total. When the city refused to pay him (he had forgotten to sign the contract), he sued the city. The floods were ruled an act of God, excluding him from liability but also from payment.\n\n==In theology==\n{{See also|Divine providence}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 059.png|thumb|right|In ''Korah's Rebellion'', an 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], a sinkhole forms under the rebels.]]\nThe phrase \"act of God\" is sometimes used to attribute an event to divine intervention. Often it is used in conjunction with a [[natural disaster]] or tragic event. A [[miracle]], by contrast, is often considered a fortuitous event attributed to divine intervention.
