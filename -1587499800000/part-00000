The school's current headteacher is Anita Johnson. The secondary school now has more than 3000 students aged from 11 to 18 years, and a primary school is connected to it. The school is a part of the Loxford School Trust which consists of 6 other academies. The school is run somewhat like a dictatorship, with the headteacher, she who shall not be named, stalking around the school enforcing her reign of terror on the children. Both teachers and students alike find the school insufferable and teachers are often leaving not long after they begin. Also the fish does really leave a lot to be desired as a former teacher, while he was teaching his year 11 triple science class once said, \"the fish is damaging your brains...

This Facebook group gained over 500 members in two weeks and discussions in the group included accounts of the students engaging in anti-semitic behaviour, including [[assault]].

The U.S. Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] concluded in 1848, term ''Hispanic'' or ''Spanish American'' was primarily used to describe the [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] within the [[American Southwest]]. The [[1970 United States Census]] controversially broadened the definition to \"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race\". This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States, outside of New Mexico.<ref name=\"Cobos-1\">Cobos, Rub\u00e9n (2003) \"Introduction,\" ''A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish'' (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; {{ISBN|0-89013-452-9}}</ref><ref name=\"OMB1997\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.

The overwhelmingly majority of Latinos descend from a mixture of Europeans and Native Americans, and depending on the regions within Latin America, a significant proportion also have high to moderate or low levels of colonial era Sub-Saharan African input. Up to a quarter of Latin Americans also possess colonial era [[New Christian]] Sephardic Jewish ancestry from a full-blooded ancestor of said ancestry within the last 8 generations. To a lesser extent other Latin Americans possess at least partial ancestry of more recent post-colonial ancestry from Ashkenazi Jews, Levantine Arabs (Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian), as well as Chinese and Japanese among others. Thus, as a whole, Latin Americans are a multiracial population, with degrees of admixture levels that vary from person to person, from varying global genetic sources. According to the [[American Community Survey|2017 American Community Survey]], 65% of Hispanic and Latinos identified as White. The largest numbers of those who consider themselves [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanics]] come from within the [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]], [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]], [[Cuban Americans|Cuban]], [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]] and [[Spanish Americans|Spanish]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918181635/http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-18 |title=Technical Documentation for the Census 2000 Modified Race Data Summary File |publisher=United States Census Bureau }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=B03002.

For example, of Latinos deriving from northern Mexico, consider themselves White or acknowledge Native American ancestry with some European mixtures, while of those deriving from southern Mexican ancestry, the majority are Native American or of Native American and European Ancestry. In Guatemala, Native American and bi-racial people of Native American and European descent make the majority, while in El Salvador, whites and Bi-racial people of Native American/European descent are the majority.

Global Advances in Health and Medicine, 2(5), 70-74.</ref> Multiple factors such as limited access to health care, legal status and income increase the risk of developing preventable health conditions because many undocumented immigrants postpone routine visits to the doctor until they become seriously ill.\n\n==Mental health==\n\n===Family separation===\n\nDuring the process of migrating to the United States, there are instances in their journey where families experience separation. Before the migration begins, those who are making the journey to the U.S. have to leave behind their families along with their homeland. Additionally, families who are in the process of crossing borders suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents. Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not have sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing. Once migrants have arrived to the new country they fear workplace raids where immigrant parents are detained and deported.\n\t\nFamily separation puts U.S born children, undocumented children and their undocumented parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome. The effects are often long-term and the impact extends to the community level. Children will experience emotional traumas and long-term changes in behaviors. Additionally, when parents are forcefully removed, children develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family. Children that are victims to family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again. These effects can cause negative parent-child attachment. Reunification may be difficult because of harsh immigration laws and re-entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents.<ref>Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12</ref> \n\t\nParents who leave behind everything in their home country also experience negative mental health experiences. According to a study published in 2013, 46% of Mexican migrant men who participated in the study reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms.<ref name=\"auto2\">Letiecq, B., L., Grzywacz, J., G., Gray, K., M., Eudave, Y., M.(2014). Depression among Mexican men on the migration frontier: the role of family separation and other structural and situational stressors. [[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]], 16, 1193-1200</ref> In recent years, the length of stay for migrants has increased, from 3 years to nearly a decade.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Migrants who were separated from their families, either married or single, experienced greater depression than married men accompanied by their spouses.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Furthermore, the study also revealed that men who are separated from their families are more prone to harsher living conditions such as overcrowded housing and are under a greater deal of pressure to send remittance to support their families. These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsens their depression. Families who migrated together experience better living conditions, receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other, and share a sense of solidarity. They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country, and aren't pressured to send remittances back home.\n\n===Discrimination===\nIt is reported that 31% of Latinos reported personal experiences with discrimination whilst 82% believed that discrimination plays a crucial role in whether they will find success living in the U.S.<ref name=\"auto3\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> The current legislation on immigration policies also plays crucial role in creating a hostile and discriminatory environment for immigrants. In order to measure discrimination for immigrants, it is taken from their perceived discrimination that they feel is towards them and can vary from: personal experiences, social attitudes and ethnic group barriers. The immigrant experience is associated to lower-self esteem, internalizing symptoms and problem behaviors amongst Mexican youth. It is also known that more time spent living in the U.S. is associated with increased feelings of distress, depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Like many other Hispanic and Latino American groups that migrate to the United States, these groups are often stigmatized and given a bad rep. An example would be after 9/11, the migrant \"Latino Other\" along with the terms refugee and asylum seeker have often been seen as a threat to nation security.<ref>Quayson, A., Daswani, G. (2013). A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishing</ref>\n\n===Vulnerabilities===\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and [[Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration. Under this new law, immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the U.S illegally were subject to be detained and/or deported without legal representation. Immigrants found themselves vulnerable and living in constant fear and mistrust because they may not be allowed back into the country indefinitely. Similarly, this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the U.S or gain legal status. These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants.<ref name=\"auto4\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H.(2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal.\n\nMany immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events. Immigrant families also do not trust government institutions and services. Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers, immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status. Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented.<ref>Hinojos, B. (2013). Stressors and Coping Strategies of Undocumented Latinos in Therapy. Public Access Theses and Dissertations from the College of Education and Human Sciences. Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance.\n\n===Stress===\n\nDespite the struggles Latinos families encounter, they have found ways to keep motivated. Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation. Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God's bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end. They kept their faith strong and pray everyday, hoping that God will keep their families safe.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\">Hinojos, B.(2013). Stressors and Coping Strategies of Undocumented Latinos in Therapy. Public Access Theses and Dissertations from the College of Education and Human Sciences. Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> Immigrants participate in church services and bond with other immigrants that share the same experiences.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Undocumented Latinos also find support from friends, family and the community that serve as coping mechanisms. Some Latinos state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going. They want their children to have a future and give them things they aren't able to have themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children, financial assistance, and counseling services.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience. Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the U.S.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income, many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress. They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\n\nMany Latino families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home. Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job. Many Latinos report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number. If they are able to obtain a job, immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship. Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification, but those jobs are often unreliable. In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported, many have to work under exploitation. In a study, a participant reported \"If someone knows that you don't have the papers. . .that person is a danger. Many people will con them. . . if they know you don't have the papers, with everything they say 'hey I'm going to call immigration on you.'\".<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> These conditions lower the income that Latino families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult. When an undocumented parent is deported or detained, income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially. The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities.

An old, colonial variety of Spanish is spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]], which is [[New Mexican Spanish]]. One of the major distinctions of New Mexican Spanish is its heavy use of colonial vocabulary and verb tenses that make [[New Mexican Spanish]] uniquely American amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] is [[Caribbean Spanish]] and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]].

Amongst younger generations of Hispanics, [[Spanglish]], or a mix of Spanish and English, may be a common way of speaking. Although they are fluent in both languages, speakers will switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation. Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic-majority cities and communities such as [[Miami]], [[Hialeah]], [[San Antonio]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/spanglish/book/|title=Do You Speak American .

In Miami, for example, the [[Miami#Dialect|Miami dialect]] has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today. This is a native dialect of English, and was developed amongst second and third generations of [[Cuban American]]s in Miami. Today, it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city. [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]] are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect.

Statistically, Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average. Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members. This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other, although four generations is uncommon in the United States. The role of [[grandparent]]s is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandparents.about.com/od/grandparentingtoday/a/hispanic_family.htm|title=Grandparents Important in Hispanic Family Structure|author=Susan Adcox|work=About.com Parenting|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nHispanics tend to be very group-oriented, and an emphasis is placed on the well-being of the family above the individual. The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rites of passages, particularly [[Roman Catholic]] [[sacrament]]s: such as [[baptism]]s, birthdays, [[First Holy Communion]]s, [[quincea\u00f1era]]s, [[Confirmation]]s, [[graduation]]s and [[wedding]]s are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|title=Hispanic Priorities: Marriage, Family and Youth|website=Hispanics.barna.org|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301025546/http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|archivedate=1 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2011/03/cultural-values-of-latino-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Latino Patients and Families|website=Dimensionsofculture.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nEducation is another important priority for Hispanic families.

Crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families. Often \"one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out, empowered, and reformed\" because it is \"sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them.\"<ref name=\"Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette 2004\">Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette. 2004.

New York: Columbia University Press.</ref> The exchange of their culture of origin with American culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important, therefore changing what it means to be Latino in the global sphere.\n\n==== Transnationalism ====\n[[File:Camila_Cabello_(Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Camila Cabello]] was born in [[Cuba]]. She moved between [[Havana]] and [[Mexico City]] before locating to [[Miami]] at age 5.]]\n\nAlong with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the United States, a new identity within the United States is formed called ''[[latinidad]]''. This is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like New York City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Underway is \"the intermeshing of different Latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of ''latinidad\"'' which establishes a \"sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many Latinos perceive to be a shared historical, spiritual, aesthetic and linguistic heritage, and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the United States.\"<ref name=\"Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette 2004\"/> This unites Latinos as one, creating cultural kin with other Latino ethnicities.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Gender roles ====\n[[File:Quincea\u00f1eraSanFranValleBravo.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Quincea\u00f1era]] after a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], celebrating a daughter's 15th birthday, common among Hispanic families]]\nMigration to the United States can change identity for Latino youth in various way, including how they carry their gendered identities. In traditional Latino households, women and young girls are homebodies or ''muchachas de la casa'' (\"girls of the house\"), showing that they abide \"by the cultural norms ... [of] respectability, chastity, and family honor [as] valued by the [Latino] community.\"<ref>Souza, Caridad (2002) \"The Sexual Identities of Young Puerto Rican Mothers,\" Di\u00e1logo: Vol. 6: No. 1, Article 10.</ref> However, when Latina women come to the United States, they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country, and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners. The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being ''de la calle'' (\"of [or from] the street\"), transgressive and sexually promiscuous. Some Latino families in the United States \"deal with young women's failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in ... [the sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not ... [the young women] are sexually active.\"<ref>P\u00e9rez, Gina. (2003), 'Puertorrique\u00f1as Rencorosas y Mejicanas Sufridas': Gendered Ethnic Identity Formation in Chicago's Latino Communities. Journal of Latin American Anthropology 8(2): 96\u2013124.</ref>\n\nAlong with the increase in independence amongst these young women, there is a diminution in the power of ''[[verg\u00fcenza]]'' (\"shame\") in many of the relations between the two sexes. To have ''verg\u00fcenza'' is to assert male dominance in all spheres, especially in a man's relationship with his female partner; the concept is enforced through shaming males into comporting themselves with a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' (literally, \"male\" or \"masculine\") archetype in order to establish respect, dominance, and manliness in their social ambits. Although many Latina women in the homeland as well as older Latina women in the United States reinforce this dynamic by not wanting a man who is a ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' (\"shameless one\"), some Latinx youth accept the label of ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' and now wear it proudly. Feeling caught between two distinct societies causes youth to \"meditate between the two cultures and [instills] ambivalence toward feeling a lack of ''verg\u00fcenza''\",<ref>Barriga, Miguel D\u00edaz. 2001. Verg\u00fcenza and Changing Chicano and Chicana Narratives. Men and Masculinities 3(1) 278-298.</ref> resulting in a group of youth who celebrate being ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' while still acknowledging the concept of ''verg\u00fcenza'' within a part of their increasingly composite culture.\n\n==== Sexuality ====\nWith the [[Catholic Church]] remaining a large influence on the Latino culture, the subject of promiscuity and sexuality is often considered taboo. It is taught in many Latino cultures that best way to remain pure of sin and not become pregnant is to remain celibate and heterosexual. All are to be straight and women are to be virgins. A woman must carry herself like a [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] in order to receive respect and keep the family's honor.\n\nHowever, despite being told that they should essentially suppress any natural feeling of sexual curiosity, through the globalization of encouraging sexual liberation, many young Latina women take their sexuality into their own hands and do not listen to the Madonna ideal. Despite this oppressive nature, \"women are neither passive nor one-dimensional individuals who automatically adapt to these culturally and socially defined moral prescriptions shaping their sex lives in some way\" but instead \"sophisticated, multidimensional, and active social agents who react to these prescriptions in multiform and complicated ways\".<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez, Gloria. 2007.

The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Latino immigrant population.

The U.S. Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] concluded in 1848, term ''Hispanic'' or ''Spanish American'' was primarily used to describe the [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] within the [[American Southwest]]. The [[1970 United States Census]] controversially broadened the definition to \"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race\". This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States, outside of New Mexico.<ref name=\"Cobos-1\">Cobos, Rub\u00e9n (2003) \"Introduction,\" ''A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish'' (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; {{ISBN|0-89013-452-9}}</ref><ref name=\"OMB1997\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.

Because of this, most Hispanics who identify themselves as ''Spaniard'' or ''Spanish'' also identify with Latin American national origin.

The overwhelmingly majority of Latinos descend from a mixture of Europeans and Native Americans, and depending on the regions within Latin America, a significant proportion also have high to moderate or low levels of colonial era Sub-Saharan African input. Up to a quarter of Latin Americans also possess colonial era [[New Christian]] Sephardic Jewish ancestry from a full-blooded ancestor of said ancestry within the last 8 generations. To a lesser extent other Latin Americans possess at least partial ancestry of more recent post-colonial ancestry from Ashkenazi Jews, Levantine Arabs (Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian), as well as Chinese and Japanese among others. Thus, as a whole, Latin Americans are a multiracial population, with degrees of admixture levels that vary from person to person, from varying global genetic sources. According to the [[American Community Survey|2017 American Community Survey]], 65% of Hispanic and Latinos identified as White. The largest numbers of those who consider themselves [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanics]] come from within the [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]], [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]], [[Cuban Americans|Cuban]], [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]] and [[Spanish Americans|Spanish]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918181635/http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-18 |title=Technical Documentation for the Census 2000 Modified Race Data Summary File |publisher=United States Census Bureau }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=B03002.

For example, of Latinos deriving from northern Mexico, consider themselves White or acknowledge Native American ancestry with some European mixtures, while of those deriving from southern Mexican ancestry, the majority are Native American or of Native American and European Ancestry. In Guatemala, Native American and bi-racial people of Native American and European descent make the majority, while in El Salvador, whites and Bi-racial people of Native American/European descent are the majority.

The phenomenon of biracial people who are predominantly of European descent identifying as white is not limited to Hispanics or Spanish speakers but is also common among English speakers as well: researchers found that most White Americans with less than 28 percent African-American ancestry say they are White; above that threshold, people tended to describe themselves as African-American.<ref>Carl Zimmer (2014).

Before the migration begins, those who are making the journey to the U.S. have to leave behind their families along with their homeland. Additionally, families who are in the process of crossing borders suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents. Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not have sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing. Once migrants have arrived to the new country they fear workplace raids where immigrant parents are detained and deported.\n\t\nFamily separation puts U.S born children, undocumented children and their undocumented parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome. The effects are often long-term and the impact extends to the community level. Children will experience emotional traumas and long-term changes in behaviors. Additionally, when parents are forcefully removed, children develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family. Children that are victims to family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again. These effects can cause negative parent-child attachment. Reunification may be difficult because of harsh immigration laws and re-entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents.<ref>Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H.

These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsens their depression. Families who migrated together experience better living conditions, receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other, and share a sense of solidarity. They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country, and aren't pressured to send remittances back home.\n\n===Discrimination===\nIt is reported that 31% of Latinos reported personal experiences with discrimination whilst 82% believed that discrimination plays a crucial role in whether they will find success living in the U.S.<ref name=\"auto3\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H. (2018). Immigration policy, practices and procedures: the impact on the mental health of Mexican and central American youth and families. American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> The current legislation on immigration policies also plays crucial role in creating a hostile and discriminatory environment for immigrants. In order to measure discrimination for immigrants, it is taken from their perceived discrimination that they feel is towards them and can vary from: personal experiences, social attitudes and ethnic group barriers. The immigrant experience is associated to lower-self esteem, internalizing symptoms and problem behaviors amongst Mexican youth. It is also known that more time spent living in the U.S. is associated with increased feelings of distress, depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Like many other Hispanic and Latino American groups that migrate to the United States, these groups are often stigmatized and given a bad rep. An example would be after 9/11, the migrant \"Latino Other\" along with the terms refugee and asylum seeker have often been seen as a threat to nation security.<ref>Quayson, A., Daswani, G. (2013). A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishing</ref>\n\n===Vulnerabilities===\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and [[Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration. Under this new law, immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the U.S illegally were subject to be detained and/or deported without legal representation. Immigrants found themselves vulnerable and living in constant fear and mistrust because they may not be allowed back into the country indefinitely. Similarly, this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the U.S or gain legal status. These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants.<ref name=\"auto4\">Torres, S., A., Santiago, C., D., Walts, K., K., Richards, M., H.(2018).

American Psychologist, 1-12.</ref> Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal.\n\nMany immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events. Immigrant families also do not trust government institutions and services. Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers, immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status. Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented.<ref>Hinojos, B. (2013).

Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance.\n\n===Stress===\n\nDespite the struggles Latinos families encounter, they have found ways to keep motivated. Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation. Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God's bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end. They kept their faith strong and pray everyday, hoping that God will keep their families safe.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\">Hinojos, B.(2013). Stressors and Coping Strategies of Undocumented Latinos in Therapy. Public Access Theses and Dissertations from the College of Education and Human Sciences. Retrieved from: https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1189&context=cehsdiss</ref> Immigrants participate in church services and bond with other immigrants that share the same experiences.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Undocumented Latinos also find support from friends, family and the community that serve as coping mechanisms. Some Latinos state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going. They want their children to have a future and give them things they aren't able to have themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children, financial assistance, and counseling services.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience. Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the U.S.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income, many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress. They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves.<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\n\nMany Latino families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home. Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job. Many Latinos report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number. If they are able to obtain a job, immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship. Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification, but those jobs are often unreliable. In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported, many have to work under exploitation. In a study, a participant reported \"If someone knows that you don't have the papers. . .that person is a danger. Many people will con them. . . if they know you don't have the papers, with everything they say 'hey I'm going to call immigration on you.'\".<ref name=\"digitalcommons.unl.edu\"/> These conditions lower the income that Latino families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult. When an undocumented parent is deported or detained, income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially. The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities. Even if families aren't separated, Latinos are constantly living in fear that they will lose their economic footing.\n\nLiving in poverty has been linked to depression, low self-esteem, loneliness, crime activities and frequent drug use among youth.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Families with low incomes are unable to afford adequate housing and some of them are evicted. The environment in which the children of undocumented immigrants grow up in are often composed of poor air quality, noise, and toxins which prevent healthy development.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Furthermore, these neighborhoods are prone to violence and gang activities, forcing the families to live in constant fear which can contribute to the development of PTSD, aggression, and depression.\n\n== Economic outlook ==\n=== Median income ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%\"\n|+ Median household income (2015)\n|-\n!Ethnicity or nationality\n!Income\n|-\n| [[Argentine Americans|Argentinean]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $60,640\n|-\n| [[Spanish Americans|Spaniards]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $60,000\n|-\n| [[Venezuelan Americans|Venezuelan]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $56,800\n|-\n| [[Peruvian Americans|Peruvian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $56,000\n|-\n| [[Colombian Americans|Colombian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $54,500\n|-\n| [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $51,000\n|-\n| [[Nicaraguan Americans|Nicaraguans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $51,000\n|-\n| [[Salvadoran Americans|Salvadoran]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $47,600\n|-\n| [[Cuban Americans|Cubans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $44,400\n|-\n| [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $44,200\n|-\n| [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $40,500\n|-\n| [[Guatemalan Americans|Guatemalans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $40,200\n|-\n| [[Dominican Americans|Dominicans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $36,800\n|-\n| [[Honduran Americans|Hondurans]]\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | $36,800\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=3 | Sources:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/09/15/the-impact-of-slowing-immigration-foreign-born-share-falls-among-14-largest-us-hispanic-origin-groups/|title=The Impact of Slowing Immigration: Foreign-Born Share Falls Among 14 Largest U.S. Hispanic Origin Groups|work=Pew Research Center|accessdate=15 September 2015|first=Gustavo|last=L\u00f3pez|date=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n|}\nIn 2017, the US Census reported the median household incomes of Hispanic and Latino Americans to be $50,486.

An old, colonial variety of Spanish is spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]], which is [[New Mexican Spanish]]. One of the major distinctions of New Mexican Spanish is its heavy use of colonial vocabulary and verb tenses that make [[New Mexican Spanish]] uniquely American amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] is [[Caribbean Spanish]] and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]].

Statistically, Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average. Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members. This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other, although four generations is uncommon in the United States.

The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rites of passages, particularly [[Roman Catholic]] [[sacrament]]s: such as [[baptism]]s, birthdays, [[First Holy Communion]]s, [[quincea\u00f1era]]s, [[Confirmation]]s, [[graduation]]s and [[wedding]]s are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|title=Hispanic Priorities: Marriage, Family and Youth|website=Hispanics.barna.org|accessdate=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301025546/http://hispanics.barna.org/hispanic-priorities-marriage-family-and-youth/|archivedate=1 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2011/03/cultural-values-of-latino-patients-and-families/|title=Cultural Values of Latino Patients and Families|website=Dimensionsofculture.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nEducation is another important priority for Hispanic families.

[of] respectability, chastity, and family honor [as] valued by the [Latino] community.\"<ref>Souza, Caridad (2002) \"The Sexual Identities of Young Puerto Rican Mothers,\" Di\u00e1logo: Vol. 6: No. 1, Article 10.</ref> However, when Latina women come to the United States, they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country, and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners. The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being ''de la calle'' (\"of [or from] the street\"), transgressive and sexually promiscuous. Some Latino families in the United States \"deal with young women's failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in ... [the sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not ... [the young women] are sexually active.\"<ref>P\u00e9rez, Gina. (2003), 'Puertorrique\u00f1as Rencorosas y Mejicanas Sufridas': Gendered Ethnic Identity Formation in Chicago's Latino Communities. Journal of Latin American Anthropology 8(2): 96\u2013124.</ref>\n\nAlong with the increase in independence amongst these young women, there is a diminution in the power of ''[[verg\u00fcenza]]'' (\"shame\") in many of the relations between the two sexes. To have ''verg\u00fcenza'' is to assert male dominance in all spheres, especially in a man's relationship with his female partner; the concept is enforced through shaming males into comporting themselves with a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' (literally, \"male\" or \"masculine\") archetype in order to establish respect, dominance, and manliness in their social ambits. Although many Latina women in the homeland as well as older Latina women in the United States reinforce this dynamic by not wanting a man who is a ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' (\"shameless one\"), some Latinx youth accept the label of ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' and now wear it proudly. Feeling caught between two distinct societies causes youth to \"meditate between the two cultures and [instills] ambivalence toward feeling a lack of ''verg\u00fcenza''\",<ref>Barriga, Miguel D\u00edaz. 2001. Verg\u00fcenza and Changing Chicano and Chicana Narratives. Men and Masculinities 3(1) 278-298.</ref> resulting in a group of youth who celebrate being ''sinverg\u00fcenza'' while still acknowledging the concept of ''verg\u00fcenza'' within a part of their increasingly composite culture.\n\n==== Sexuality ====\nWith the [[Catholic Church]] remaining a large influence on the Latino culture, the subject of promiscuity and sexuality is often considered taboo. It is taught in many Latino cultures that best way to remain pure of sin and not become pregnant is to remain celibate and heterosexual. All are to be straight and women are to be virgins. A woman must carry herself like a [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] in order to receive respect and keep the family's honor.\n\nHowever, despite being told that they should essentially suppress any natural feeling of sexual curiosity, through the globalization of encouraging sexual liberation, many young Latina women take their sexuality into their own hands and do not listen to the Madonna ideal. Despite this oppressive nature, \"women are neither passive nor one-dimensional individuals who automatically adapt to these culturally and socially defined moral prescriptions shaping their sex lives in some way\" but instead \"sophisticated, multidimensional, and active social agents who react to these prescriptions in multiform and complicated ways\".<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez, Gloria. 2007.

The report also surveyed three cities: [[Chicago]] (with its well-established Latino community); [[Washington, D.C.]] (with a less-established but quickly growing Hispanic community); and [[Raleigh-Durham]] (with a very new but rapidly growing Hispanic community).

The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Latino immigrant population. The perception is that this new labor arrangement has driven down wages, removed benefits, and rendered temporary, jobs that once were stable (but also benefiting consumers who receive lower-cost services) while passing the costs of labor (healthcare and indirectly education) onto the community at large.<ref>[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Saucedo_African_Am_Immigrant_Tensions_Final_brief.pdf University of Berkeley Law School: Research Brief \"Labor arrangement corresponds with the growth in the Latino immigrant population\"] July 2008</ref>\n* A 2008 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll indicated that 60% of Hispanics and 67% of blacks believe that good relations exist between US blacks and Hispanics<ref name=Gallup2008>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/108868/whites-may-exaggerate-blackhispanic-tensions.aspx Gallup: \"Whites May Exaggerate Black-Hispanic Tensions\" by Lydia Saad] July 17, 2008</ref> while only 29% of blacks, 36% of Hispanics, and 43% of whites, say Black\u2013Hispanic relations are bad.<ref name=Gallup2008 />\n* In 2009, in [[Los Angeles County]], Latinos committed 77% of the hate crimes against black victims and blacks committed half of the hate crimes against Latinos.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/hate-crimes-in-la-county-down-overall-anti-jewish-vandalism-rises.html Los Angeles Times: \"Hate crimes in L.A.

The game has been published by several companies over time, most prominently during a war for the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by [[Nintendo]], the rights of the game reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded [[The Tetris Company]] with [[Henk Rogers]] to manage licensing for ''Tetris''.\n\n''Tetris'' challenges the player to create complete lines by moving differently-shaped pieces \u2013 the [[tetromino]]es, which scroll from the top to bottom of the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the point that additional pieces can no longer descend. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, the players must last longer than their opponents, and in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some adaptations have provided variations to the game's theme, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces.\n\nBuilt on simple rules and requiring intelligence and skill, ''Tetris'' has established itself as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the great classic video game titles]] alongside ''[[Pong]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Since its creation, ''Tetris'' has sold 202{{nbsp}}million copies \u2013 approximately 70{{nbsp}}million physical units and 132{{nbsp}}million paid [[mobile game]] downloads \u2013 as of December 2011, making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises of all time]]; the [[Game Boy]] version in particular is [[List of best-selling video games|one of the best-selling single titles of all time]], with over 35 million copies sold. The game is available on [[List of Tetris variants|over 65 platforms]], setting a [[Guinness World Records|''Guinness'' world record]] for the most ported video game title. ''Tetris'' is rooted within popular culture and its notoriety extends beyond the sphere of video games; imagery from the game has influenced architecture, music and cosplay. The game has also been the subject of various research studies that have analyzed its theoretical complexity and have shown its effect on the human brain following a session, in particular the [[Tetris effect]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Tetris basic game.gif|thumb|Video of an open-source ''Tetris'' [[Clone (video game)|clone]]]]\n''Tetris'' is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called \"[[Tetromino|tetriminos]]\", descend from the top of the field.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.<ref name=\"AboutTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/about-us |title=About ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 14, 2019}}</ref> The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them in most versions.<ref>''Tetris'' (Game Boy) instruction booklet, p. 4</ref><ref>''Tetris DS'' instruction booklet, p. 6</ref> The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible.

The contents of these guidelines establish such elements as the correspondence of buttons and actions, the size of the field of play, the system of rotation, and others.<ref name=\"HistoryOfTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/history-of-tetris |title=History of ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"tftt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/11267/tetris-from-the-top-an-interview-with-henk-rogers |title=''Tetris'' from the Top: An Interview with Henk Rogers |author=Metts, Jonathan |website=Nintendo World Report |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Game pieces===\n[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|left|All seven tetriminos using the standard color scheme]]\nThe pieces on which the game of ''Tetris'' is based around are called \"tetriminos\". Pajitnov's original version for the [[Electronika 60]] computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetriminos.<ref name=\"vadim\"/> Versions of ''Tetris'' on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use [[monochrome]] or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape. Prior to The Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe scoring formula for the majority of ''Tetris'' products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in ''Tetris Zone'' is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a ''Tetris'') is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back ''Tetris'' is worth 1,200.<ref name=\"tzmanual\">[http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual ''Tetris Zone'' manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023148/http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual |date=February 6, 2009 }} as of November 12, 2008</ref> In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance assigned to them, vary from game to game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNearly all ''Tetris'' games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a \"soft drop\" and a \"hard drop\", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.\n\n===Debate on the possibility of an infinite game===\nThe question ''Would it be possible to play forever?'' was first considered in a thesis by John Brzustowski in 1992.<ref>John Brzustowski. [https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016151137/https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1 |date=October 16, 2013 }}. Retrieved October 16, 2013.</ref> The conclusion reached was that the game is statistically doomed to end. The reason has to do with the S and Z Tetriminos. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z Tetriminos, the na\u00efve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated [[Random number generation|random number generator]] is played long enough, any player will top out.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061209110731/http://www.math.uic.edu/~burgiel/Tetris/explanation.html Dr. Burgiel's Tetris Research Page, Explanation].

Some [[List of Tetris variants|variants]] allow the player to choose to play with only S and Z Tetriminos, and a good player may survive well over 150 consecutive Tetriminos this way. On an implementation with an ideal uniform randomizer, the probability at any given time of the next 150 Tetriminos being only S and Z is ({{sfrac|2|7}})<sup>150</sup> (approximately {{val|2e-82}}). Most implementations use a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate the sequence of Tetriminos, and such an S\u2013Z sequence is almost certainly not contained in the sequence produced by the 32-bit [[linear congruential generator]] in many implementations (which has roughly {{val|4.2e9}} states). The \"evil\" algorithm in ''Bastet'' (an unofficial variant) often starts a game with a series of more than seven Z pieces.\n\nModern versions of ''Tetris'' released after 2001 use a bag-style randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S or Z pieces in a row. This is one of the \"Indispensable Rules\" enforced by the ''Tetris Guideline'' that all officially licensed ''Tetris'' games must follow.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\nRecent versions of ''Tetris'' such as ''Tetris Worlds'' allow the player to repeatedly rotate a block once it hits the bottom of the playfield without it locking into place. This permits a player to play for an infinite amount of time, though not necessarily to land an infinite number of blocks.\n\n=== Easy spin dispute ===\nAlthough not the first ''Tetris'' game to feature a new kind of ''Tetris'', \"easy spin\" (see ''[[The Next Tetris]]''), also called \"infinite spin\" by critics,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |title=Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=September 5, 2001 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028130427/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |archive-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Tetris Worlds]]'' was the first game to fall under major criticisms for it. Easy spin refers to the property of a Tetromino to stop falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing someone to suspend the Tetromino while thinking on where to place it. This feature has been implemented into [[The Tetris Company]]'s official guideline.<ref name=\"tftt\"/> This type of play differs from traditional ''Tetris'' because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed. Some reviewers<ref name=\"gsrev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|title=Tetris Worlds for PlayStation 2 Review|accessdate=November 12, 2008|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 19, 2002|author1=Jeff Gerstmann|author2=Ryan Davis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130070533/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|archive-date=January 30, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game. The goal in ''Tetris Worlds'', however, is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received \"easy spin\" more openly, saying that \"the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in ''Tetris DS'', because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |title=Tetris DS for DS Review \u2013 GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040528/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In response to the issue, [[Henk Rogers]] stated in an interview that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. Rogers observed that \"gratuitous spinning\" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of inputs i.e.: rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 inputs.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width    = 250\n | image1   = Tetris-VeryFirstVersion.png\n | caption1 = The first version of ''Tetris'', completed in 1984, run on an emulator of the [[Electronika 60]]\n | image2   = Tetris DOS 1986.png\n | caption2 = Screenshot of the 1986 IBM PC version developed by Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]]\n | image3   = Tetris screenshot (Amiga, Infogrames).png\n | caption3 = The version designed by Spectrum Holobyte contained Russia-related images (Amiga version screenshot, 1988)\n}}\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1979, [[Alexey Pajitnov]] joined the Computer Center of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] as a [[speech recognition]] researcher.

However, he had no knowledge of the business world, and his superiors in the Academy were not necessarily happy with the success of the game, since they had not intended such a creation from the research team.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=87}} Furthermore, [[intellectual property]] did not exist in the Soviet Union, and Soviet researchers were not allowed to sell their creations.{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=301}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=10 min.}} Pajitnov asked his supervisor Victor Brjabrin, who had knowledge of the world outside the Soviet Union, to help him publish ''Tetris''. Pajitnov offered to transfer the rights of the game to the Academy, and was delighted to receive a non-compulsory remuneration from Brjabrin through this deal.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=88}}\n\n===Acquisition of rights by Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte===\nIn 1986, Brjabrin sent a copy of ''Tetris'' to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] game publisher [[Appaloosa Interactive|Novotrade]].{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=88}} From there, clones of the game began circulating via [[floppy disk]]s throughout Hungary and as far as [[Poland]].{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=89}} Robert Stein, an international software salesman for the London-based firm Andromeda Software, saw the game's commercial potential during a visit to Hungary in June 1986.{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=302}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=11 min.}} After an indifferent response from the Academy,{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=12 min.}} Stein contacted Pajitnov and Brjabrin by fax in order to obtain the rights to the license.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=11 min.}} The researchers expressed interest in forming an agreement with Stein.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=12 min.}} However, they were unaware that a fax machine had legal value in the Western world, and Stein began to approach other companies to produce the game.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|pp=89\u201390}} Pajitnov was never able to digest this misunderstanding; in an interview with the website Kikizo, he declared \"I don\u2019t really like to talk about that because when I think about those things I lose my sense of humor.\"{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=294}}\n\nStein thus took advantage of the 1987 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]] to approach several publishers. Gary Carlston, co-founder of [[Broderbund]], retrieved a copy and brought it to [[California]]. Despite enthusiasm amongst its employees, Broderbund remained skeptical because of the game's Soviet origins. Likewise, [[Mastertronic]] co-founder Martin Alper declared that \"No Soviet product will ever work in the Western world.\"{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}} Stein ultimately signed two agreements: he sold the European rights to the publisher [[Mirrorsoft]],{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}}{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}} and the American rights to [[Spectrum HoloByte]].{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}}{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=294}} The latter obtained the rights after a visit by Mirrorsoft president Phil Adams in which he played ''Tetris'' for two hours.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=15 min.}} At that time, Stein had not yet signed a contract with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}} Nevertheless, he sold the rights to the two companies for \u00a33,000 and a royalty of 7.5 to 15% on sales.{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=304}}\n\nBefore releasing ''Tetris'' in the United States, Spectrum HoloByte CEO Gilman Louie asked for an overhaul of the game's graphics and music.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}} The Soviet spirit was preserved, with fields illustrating Russian parks and buildings as well as melodies anchored in Russian folklore of the time. The company's goal was to make people want to buy a Russian product; the game came complete with a red package and Cyrillic text, an unusual approach on the other side of the [[Berlin Wall]].{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=16 min.}} The Mirrorsoft version was released for the IBM PC in November 1987,{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=91}} while the Spectrum HoloByte version was released for the same platform in January 1988.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=294}}{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=91}} The game was subsequently ported to other platforms, most notably the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. At the time, the game made no mention of Pajitnov and came with the announcement of \"Made in the United States of America, designed abroad\". ''Tetris'' was a commercial success in Europe and the United States: Mirrorsoft sold tens of thousands of copies in two months.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=91}} The game sold 100,000 units in the space of a year.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=18 min.}} According to Spectrum HoloByte, the average profile of a ''Tetris'' player was an adult between 25\u201345 years of age who was a manager or an engineer. At the [[Software and Information Industry Association|Software Publishers Association]] \"Excellence in Software Awards\" ceremony in March 1988, ''Tetris'' obtained four awards: Best Entertainment Software, Best Original Game, Best Strategy Program, and Best Consumer Software.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=91}}\n\nStein, however, was faced with a problem: the only document certifying a license fee was the fax from Pajitnov and Brjabrin, meaning that Stein sold the license for a game he did not yet own. Stein contacted Pajitnov and asked him for a contract for the rights.

Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games and arcade machines to [[Henk Rogers]], who was searching for games for the Japanese market.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=22 min.}} Mirrorsoft sold its own Japanese rights to [[Atari Games]] subsidiary [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]; the latter would then sell the arcade rights to [[Sega]] and the console rights to Rogers. At this point, almost a dozen companies believed they held the rights to the game, with Stein retaining rights for home computer versions.{{sfn|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=480}} Elorg was still unaware of the deals Stein had negotiated, which did not bring money to them. Nevertheless, ''Tetris'' was a commercial success in North America, Eurpoe and Asia.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=22 min.}}\n\nThe same year, [[Nintendo]] was preparing to launch its first portable console, the [[Game Boy]].

At that point, Elorg was faced with three different companies who wished to buy the rights.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=35 min.}}\n\nDuring this time, Rogers befriended Pajitnov over a [[Go (game)|game of Go]], and Pajitnov would support Rogers throughout the discussions, to the detriment of Maxwell, who came to secure the ''Tetris'' rights for Mirrorsoft.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=93}} Belikov proposed to Rogers that Stein's rights would be cancelled and Nintendo would be granted the game rights for both home and handheld consoles.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=94}} Rogers then flew to the United States to convince Nintendo's American branch to sign up for the rights. The contract with Elorg was signed by [[Minoru Arakawa]] and [[Howard Lincoln]] for $500,000, plus 50 cents per cartridge sold.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=42 min.}} Elorg then sent an updated contract to Stein. One of the contract's clauses defined a computer as a machine with a screen and keyboard, and thus Stein's rights to console versions were withdrawn.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=37 min.}} Stein signed the contract without paying attention to this clause,{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}} and he later realized that all the contract's other clauses, notably on payments, were only a \"smokescreen\" to deceive him.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=37 min.}}{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=319}}\n\nIn March 1989, Nintendo sent a [[cease and desist]] fax to Atari Games concerning production of the NES version of ''Tetris''.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=47 min.}} Atari Games contacted Mirrorsoft, and were assured that they still retained the rights. Nintendo, however, maintained its position. In response, Mirrorsoft owner [[Robert Maxwell]] pressured Soviet Union leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to cancel the contract between Elorg and Nintendo.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}} Despite the threats to Belikov, Elorg refused to give in and highlighted the financial advantages of their contract compared to those signed with Stein and Mirrorsoft.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=45 min.}} On November 1989, Nintendo and Atari Games began a legal battle in the courts of [[San Francisco]]. Atari Games sought to prove that the NES was a computer, as indicated by its Japanese name \"Famicom\", an abbrieviation of \"Family Computer\". In this case, the initial license would then authorize Atari Games to release the game. The central argument of Atari Games was that the Famicom was designed to be convertible into a computer via its extension port. This argument was not accepted, and Pajitnov stressed that the initial contract only concerned computers and no other machine.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=96}} For its part, Nintendo brought Belikov to testify on its behalf.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=48 min.}} Judge Fern Smith then declared that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte never received explicit authorization for marketing on consoles, and ruled in Nintendo's favor.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=96}} On June 21, 1989, Atari Games withdrew its NES version from sale, and thousands of cartridges remained unsold in the company's warehouses.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=From Russia with Litigation |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1997 |page=42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |year=2002 |title=The Wish List |journal=Edge Presents Retro}}</ref>\n\nSega had planned to release a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] version of ''Tetris'' on April 15, 1989, but they cancelled its release<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890501p.pdf#page=14|title=Game Machine: \"Nintendo Offers Home Video Game 'Tetris'\"|publisher=Amusement Press|date=1989-05-01}}</ref> during Atari's licensing issues, resulting in fewer than ten copies being printed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |title=You Could Own This Copy of Tetris for Only $1,000,000 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |work=Kotaku |date=July 18, 2011 | access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604193847/https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A new port of the arcade version by M2 was included in the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] microconsole, released in September 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604221811/https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Commercial success and acquisition of rights by Pajitnov===\n{{Main|The Tetris Company}}\n[[File:Tetris NES play.png|thumb|right|250px|A-Type game screenshot of the official [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of ''Tetris'']]\nThrough the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West.

The game has been published by several companies over time, most prominently during a war for the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by [[Nintendo]], the rights of the game reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded [[The Tetris Company]] with [[Henk Rogers]] to manage licensing for ''Tetris''.\n\n''Tetris'' challenges the player to create complete lines by moving differently-shaped pieces \u2013 the [[tetromino]]es, which scroll from the top to bottom of the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the point that additional pieces can no longer descend. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, the players must last longer than their opponents, and in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some adaptations have provided variations to the game's theme, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces.\n\nBuilt on simple rules and requiring intelligence and skill, ''Tetris'' has established itself as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the great classic video game titles]] alongside ''[[Pong]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Since its creation, ''Tetris'' has sold 202{{nbsp}}million copies \u2013 approximately 70{{nbsp}}million physical units and 132{{nbsp}}million paid [[mobile game]] downloads \u2013 as of December 2011, making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises of all time]]; the [[Game Boy]] version in particular is [[List of best-selling video games|one of the best-selling single titles of all time]], with over 35 million copies sold. The game is available on [[List of Tetris variants|over 65 platforms]], setting a [[Guinness World Records|''Guinness'' world record]] for the most ported video game title. ''Tetris'' is rooted within popular culture and its notoriety extends beyond the sphere of video games; imagery from the game has influenced architecture, music and cosplay. The game has also been the subject of various research studies that have analyzed its theoretical complexity and have shown its effect on the human brain following a session, in particular the [[Tetris effect]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Tetris basic game.gif|thumb|Video of an open-source ''Tetris'' [[Clone (video game)|clone]]]]\n''Tetris'' is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called \"[[Tetromino|tetriminos]]\", descend from the top of the field.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.<ref name=\"AboutTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/about-us |title=About ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 14, 2019}}</ref> The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them in most versions.<ref>''Tetris'' (Game Boy) instruction booklet, p. 4</ref><ref>''Tetris DS'' instruction booklet, p. 6</ref> The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible.

The contents of these guidelines establish such elements as the correspondence of buttons and actions, the size of the field of play, the system of rotation, and others.<ref name=\"HistoryOfTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/history-of-tetris |title=History of ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"tftt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/11267/tetris-from-the-top-an-interview-with-henk-rogers |title=''Tetris'' from the Top: An Interview with Henk Rogers |author=Metts, Jonathan |website=Nintendo World Report |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Game pieces===\n[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|left|All seven tetriminos using the standard color scheme]]\nThe pieces on which the game of ''Tetris'' is based around are called \"tetriminos\". Pajitnov's original version for the [[Electronika 60]] computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetriminos.<ref name=\"vadim\"/> Versions of ''Tetris'' on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use [[monochrome]] or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape. Prior to The Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe scoring formula for the majority of ''Tetris'' products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in ''Tetris Zone'' is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a ''Tetris'') is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back ''Tetris'' is worth 1,200.<ref name=\"tzmanual\">[http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual ''Tetris Zone'' manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023148/http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual |date=February 6, 2009 }} as of November 12, 2008</ref> In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance assigned to them, vary from game to game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNearly all ''Tetris'' games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a \"soft drop\" and a \"hard drop\", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.\n\n===Debate on the possibility of an infinite game===\nThe question ''Would it be possible to play forever?'' was first considered in a thesis by John Brzustowski in 1992.<ref>John Brzustowski. [https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016151137/https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1 |date=October 16, 2013 }}. Retrieved October 16, 2013.</ref> The conclusion reached was that the game is statistically doomed to end. The reason has to do with the S and Z Tetriminos. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z Tetriminos, the na\u00efve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated [[Random number generation|random number generator]] is played long enough, any player will top out.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061209110731/http://www.math.uic.edu/~burgiel/Tetris/explanation.html Dr. Burgiel's Tetris Research Page, Explanation].

Some [[List of Tetris variants|variants]] allow the player to choose to play with only S and Z Tetriminos, and a good player may survive well over 150 consecutive Tetriminos this way. On an implementation with an ideal uniform randomizer, the probability at any given time of the next 150 Tetriminos being only S and Z is ({{sfrac|2|7}})<sup>150</sup> (approximately {{val|2e-82}}). Most implementations use a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate the sequence of Tetriminos, and such an S\u2013Z sequence is almost certainly not contained in the sequence produced by the 32-bit [[linear congruential generator]] in many implementations (which has roughly {{val|4.2e9}} states). The \"evil\" algorithm in ''Bastet'' (an unofficial variant) often starts a game with a series of more than seven Z pieces.\n\nModern versions of ''Tetris'' released after 2001 use a bag-style randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S or Z pieces in a row. This is one of the \"Indispensable Rules\" enforced by the ''Tetris Guideline'' that all officially licensed ''Tetris'' games must follow.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\nRecent versions of ''Tetris'' such as ''Tetris Worlds'' allow the player to repeatedly rotate a block once it hits the bottom of the playfield without it locking into place. This permits a player to play for an infinite amount of time, though not necessarily to land an infinite number of blocks.\n\n=== Easy spin dispute ===\nAlthough not the first ''Tetris'' game to feature a new kind of ''Tetris'', \"easy spin\" (see ''[[The Next Tetris]]''), also called \"infinite spin\" by critics,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |title=Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=September 5, 2001 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028130427/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |archive-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Tetris Worlds]]'' was the first game to fall under major criticisms for it. Easy spin refers to the property of a Tetromino to stop falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing someone to suspend the Tetromino while thinking on where to place it. This feature has been implemented into [[The Tetris Company]]'s official guideline.<ref name=\"tftt\"/> This type of play differs from traditional ''Tetris'' because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed.

The goal in ''Tetris Worlds'', however, is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received \"easy spin\" more openly, saying that \"the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in ''Tetris DS'', because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |title=Tetris DS for DS Review \u2013 GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040528/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In response to the issue, [[Henk Rogers]] stated in an interview that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. Rogers observed that \"gratuitous spinning\" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of inputs i.e.: rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 inputs.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width    = 250\n | image1   = Tetris-VeryFirstVersion.png\n | caption1 = The first version of ''Tetris'', completed in 1984, run on an emulator of the [[Electronika 60]]\n | image2   = Tetris DOS 1986.png\n | caption2 = Screenshot of the 1986 IBM PC version developed by Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]]\n | image3   = Tetris screenshot (Amiga, Infogrames).png\n | caption3 = The version designed by Spectrum Holobyte contained Russia-related images (Amiga version screenshot, 1988)\n}}\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1979, [[Alexey Pajitnov]] joined the Computer Center of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] as a [[speech recognition]] researcher.

Gary Carlston, co-founder of [[Broderbund]], retrieved a copy and brought it to [[California]]. Despite enthusiasm amongst its employees, Broderbund remained skeptical because of the game's Soviet origins. Likewise, [[Mastertronic]] co-founder Martin Alper declared that \"No Soviet product will ever work in the Western world.\"{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}} Stein ultimately signed two agreements: he sold the European rights to the publisher [[Mirrorsoft]],{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}}{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}} and the American rights to [[Spectrum HoloByte]].{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}}{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=294}} The latter obtained the rights after a visit by Mirrorsoft president Phil Adams in which he played ''Tetris'' for two hours.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=15 min.}} At that time, Stein had not yet signed a contract with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=479}} Nevertheless, he sold the rights to the two companies for \u00a33,000 and a royalty of 7.5 to 15% on sales.{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=304}}\n\nBefore releasing ''Tetris'' in the United States, Spectrum HoloByte CEO Gilman Louie asked for an overhaul of the game's graphics and music.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=90}} The Soviet spirit was preserved, with fields illustrating Russian parks and buildings as well as melodies anchored in Russian folklore of the time.

At the time, the game made no mention of Pajitnov and came with the announcement of \"Made in the United States of America, designed abroad\". ''Tetris'' was a commercial success in Europe and the United States: Mirrorsoft sold tens of thousands of copies in two months.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=91}} The game sold 100,000 units in the space of a year.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=18 min.}} According to Spectrum HoloByte, the average profile of a ''Tetris'' player was an adult between 25\u201345 years of age who was a manager or an engineer. At the [[Software and Information Industry Association|Software Publishers Association]] \"Excellence in Software Awards\" ceremony in March 1988, ''Tetris'' obtained four awards: Best Entertainment Software, Best Original Game, Best Strategy Program, and Best Consumer Software.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=91}}\n\nStein, however, was faced with a problem: the only document certifying a license fee was the fax from Pajitnov and Brjabrin, meaning that Stein sold the license for a game he did not yet own. Stein contacted Pajitnov and asked him for a contract for the rights. Stein began negotiations via fax, offering 75% of the revenue generated by Stein from the license.{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=304}} [[Elektronorgtechnica]] (\"Elorg\"), the Soviet Union's central organization for the import and export of computer software, was unconvinced by this offer and requested 80% of the revenue.

Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games and arcade machines to [[Henk Rogers]], who was searching for games for the Japanese market.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=22 min.}} Mirrorsoft sold its own Japanese rights to [[Atari Games]] subsidiary [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]; the latter would then sell the arcade rights to [[Sega]] and the console rights to Rogers. At this point, almost a dozen companies believed they held the rights to the game, with Stein retaining rights for home computer versions.{{sfn|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=480}} Elorg was still unaware of the deals Stein had negotiated, which did not bring money to them. Nevertheless, ''Tetris'' was a commercial success in North America, Eurpoe and Asia.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=22 min.}}\n\nThe same year, [[Nintendo]] was preparing to launch its first portable console, the [[Game Boy]]. Nintendo was attracted to ''Tetris'' by its simplicity and established success on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]].{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=92}}{{sfn|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=480}} Rogers, who was close to Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], then sought to recover the handheld rights.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=92}} After a failed negotiation with Atari Games,{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=93}} Rogers contacted Stein in November 1988.

At that point, Elorg was faced with three different companies who wished to buy the rights.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=35 min.}}\n\nDuring this time, Rogers befriended Pajitnov over a [[Go (game)|game of Go]], and Pajitnov would support Rogers throughout the discussions, to the detriment of Maxwell, who came to secure the ''Tetris'' rights for Mirrorsoft.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=93}} Belikov proposed to Rogers that Stein's rights would be cancelled and Nintendo would be granted the game rights for both home and handheld consoles.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=94}} Rogers then flew to the United States to convince Nintendo's American branch to sign up for the rights. The contract with Elorg was signed by [[Minoru Arakawa]] and [[Howard Lincoln]] for $500,000, plus 50 cents per cartridge sold.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=42 min.}} Elorg then sent an updated contract to Stein. One of the contract's clauses defined a computer as a machine with a screen and keyboard, and thus Stein's rights to console versions were withdrawn.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=37 min.}} Stein signed the contract without paying attention to this clause,{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}} and he later realized that all the contract's other clauses, notably on payments, were only a \"smokescreen\" to deceive him.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=37 min.}}{{sfn|Sheff|1999|p=319}}\n\nIn March 1989, Nintendo sent a [[cease and desist]] fax to Atari Games concerning production of the NES version of ''Tetris''.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=47 min.}} Atari Games contacted Mirrorsoft, and were assured that they still retained the rights. Nintendo, however, maintained its position. In response, Mirrorsoft owner [[Robert Maxwell]] pressured Soviet Union leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to cancel the contract between Elorg and Nintendo.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}} Despite the threats to Belikov, Elorg refused to give in and highlighted the financial advantages of their contract compared to those signed with Stein and Mirrorsoft.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=95}}{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=45 min.}} On November 1989, Nintendo and Atari Games began a legal battle in the courts of [[San Francisco]]. Atari Games sought to prove that the NES was a computer, as indicated by its Japanese name \"Famicom\", an abbrieviation of \"Family Computer\". In this case, the initial license would then authorize Atari Games to release the game. The central argument of Atari Games was that the Famicom was designed to be convertible into a computer via its extension port. This argument was not accepted, and Pajitnov stressed that the initial contract only concerned computers and no other machine.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=96}} For its part, Nintendo brought Belikov to testify on its behalf.{{sfn|Temple|2004|loc=48 min.}} Judge Fern Smith then declared that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte never received explicit authorization for marketing on consoles, and ruled in Nintendo's favor.{{sfn|Ichbiah|1997|p=96}} On June 21, 1989, Atari Games withdrew its NES version from sale, and thousands of cartridges remained unsold in the company's warehouses.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=From Russia with Litigation |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1997 |page=42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |year=2002 |title=The Wish List |journal=Edge Presents Retro}}</ref>\n\nSega had planned to release a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] version of ''Tetris'' on April 15, 1989, but they cancelled its release<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890501p.pdf#page=14|title=Game Machine: \"Nintendo Offers Home Video Game 'Tetris'\"|publisher=Amusement Press|date=1989-05-01}}</ref> during Atari's licensing issues, resulting in fewer than ten copies being printed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |title=You Could Own This Copy of Tetris for Only $1,000,000 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |work=Kotaku |date=July 18, 2011 | access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604193847/https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A new port of the arcade version by M2 was included in the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] microconsole, released in September 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604221811/https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Commercial success and acquisition of rights by Pajitnov===\n{{Main|The Tetris Company}}\n[[File:Tetris NES play.png|thumb|right|250px|A-Type game screenshot of the official [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of ''Tetris'']]\nThrough the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West.

Developers are given freedom to add new modes of play and revisit the concept from different angles.

It was proven that for the \"offline\" version of ''Tetris'' (the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped, i.e. there is no hidden information) the following objectives are [[NP-complete]]:\n* Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence.\n* Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs.\n* Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows.\n* Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence.\n\nAlso, it is [[Hardness of approximation|difficult to even approximately solve]] the first, second, and fourth problem.  It is [[NP-hard]], given an initial gameboard and a sequence of ''p'' pieces, to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of {{nowrap|''p''<sup>1 \u2212 ''\u03b5''</sup>}} for any constant {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' > 0}}.\nIt is NP-hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of {{nowrap|2 \u2212 ''\u03b5''}} for any constant {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' > 0}}.\n\nTo prove NP-completeness, it was shown that there is a polynomial [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] between the [[3-partition problem]], which is also NP-complete, and the ''Tetris'' problem.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|title=Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate|last1=Demaine|first1=Erik D.|last2=Hohenberger|first2=Susan|last3=Liben-Nowell|first3=David|date=July 25\u201328, 2003|conference=Proceedings of the 9th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2003)|conferenceurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042734/http://www.cs.montana.edu/bhz/cocoon03.html|location=Big Sky, Montana|access-date=December 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613201613/http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|archive-date=June 13, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|Korobeiniki#Tetris arrangements and modern cover versions|Tetris (Game Boy video game)#Music}}\nThe earliest versions of ''Tetris'' had no music. The NES version includes two original compositions by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] along with an arrangement of \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from the second act of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', composed by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]. The [[Blue Planet Software]] and [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]] versions also feature original music, with the exception of an arrangement of \"[[Kalinka (song)|Kalinka]]\" in the Tengen version. Nintendo's Game Boy version includes three pieces of music as well: \"[[Korobeiniki]]\", [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[French Suites, BWV 812-817|French Suite No. 3 In B Minor]] (BWV 814), and an original track by Tanaka. \"Korobeiniki\" is used in most later versions of the game, and has appeared in other games, albums and films that make reference to ''Tetris''.

The definition of \"fastest-selling\" typically refers to sales results in the first week of a product's release, (i.e., which product had the biggest launch). Sometimes, rather than comparing sales figures relative to time, the target to be reached is fixed (e.g. sales at 5&nbsp;million units), and the comparison is based upon how many weeks it takes to reach it (e.g. 52 weeks vs. 56 weeks).\n\n== Books ==\n* 2007 Book \u2013 ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' by [[J.
