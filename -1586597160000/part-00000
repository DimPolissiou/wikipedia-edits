Reverse..jpg|thumb|300px|The reverse side features the Bohemian Lion and the name of [[Louis II of Bohemia and Hungary|King Ludovicus]]. ]]\n\nA  '''thaler''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u0251\u02d0|l|\u0259r}}) is one of the large [[silver coin]]s minted in the states and territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg monarchy]] during the [[Early Modern period]]. A ''thaler'' size silver coin has a diameter of about 40 mm and a weight of about 25 to 30 grams, or roughly [[avoirdupois ounce|1 ounce]].\n\nThe word is shortened from ''Joachimsthaler'', the original ''thaler'' coin minted in [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimstal]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], from 1518.\nAfter the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German ''Reichstaler'' survived in the form of the [[Prussian thaler]] (later ''[[Vereinsthaler]]'') until 1871.\n\nIts name lives on in the many currencies called ''[[dollar]]'' and the [[Samoan t\u0101l\u0101]], and, until 2007, also in the [[Slovenian tolar]].\nThe ''thaler'' silver coin type continued to be minted as legal tender of modern currencies, such as the US [[ Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] (until 1935) and the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]] (until 1969).\nMany government mints continue to issue thaler sized silver coins with face values in national currency, now known as [[Bullion_coin#Silver|bullion coins]], as their silver value significantly exceeds the face value.\n\n==Etymology==\nGerman ''taler'' is recorded from the 1530s, as an abbreviation of ''Joachimstaler''. The mines at [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimstal]] having had opened in 1516, and the first such coins were minted there in 1518.\nThe original spelling was ''taler'' (so [[Erasmus Alberus|Alberus]] 1540).\nGerman ''-taler'' means \"of the valley\" (c.f. ''[[Neanderthal#Etymology|Neanderthaler]]'').\nBy the late 16th century, the word was variously spelled as German ''taler'', ''toler'', ''thaler'', ''thaller''; Low German ''daler'', ''dahler''.\nIn 19th-century German orthography, ''Thaler'' became standard, changed to ''Taler'' in the  [[German Orthographic Conference of 1901|1902 spelling reform]].\n\nThe name ''thaler'' soon came to be used as a suffix denoting various types of silver coins of thaler size, \nthus\n''Kreuzthaler'', ''Albertusthaler'' (1612), ''Kronenthaler'' (1755), ''Kaubthaler'', ''Ortsthaler'', ''[[Reichsthaler]]'' (1566), ''Silberthaler'', ''[[Sch\u00fctzenthaler]]'', ''Laubthaler'' (1726), ''[[Conventionsthaler]]'' (1754), ''Bankthaler'',  ''Spesciesthaler'' (etc.).\nThe  Dutch {{lang|nl|daalders}} also carried the picture of a lion, which gave them the name {{lang|nl|leeuwendaalder}} (\"lion thaler\", 1575).  \nFrom 1750, German ''Thaler'' predominantly refers to the [[Prussian thaler|Prussian ''Reichsthaler'']] (1750&ndash;1857), \nafter 1857 the ''[[Vereinsthaler]]'' (in 1871 replaced by the ''[[German gold mark|Mark]]'').\n\nThe corresponding English silver coin of the period was the ''[[Crown (English coin)|crown]]''. \nThe Low German word was adopted in English as ''daler'' by 1550, modified to ''dollar'' by about 1600.\n<ref>Christian Ludwig, ''Teutsch-Englisches Lexicon'' (1789), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=DCj8dJG29fgC&pg=RA1-PA447 c.448] gives ''dollar, doller'' as the English translation of ''Thaler''.</ref>\nEnglish ''thaler'' was introduced in the first half of the 19th century to refer to the coins of the German states, as the word ''dollar'' was increasingly understood to refer to the [[United States dollar]].\n\n==Predecessors==\nThe development of large silver coins is an innovation of the beginning [[Early Modern period]].\nThe largest medieval silver coins were known as [[Groat (coin)|groat]] (German ''Groschen''), from ''denarius grossus'' or \"thick penny\". These rarely exceeded a weight of 6 grams.\nIn the late 15th century, even these coins were increasingly debased, as a general silver shortage developed in Europe for a number of reasons, induced by the costs of continual warfare, and by the incessant centuries-long loss of silver and gold in indirect one-sided trades importing [[spice]]s, [[porcelain]], [[silk]] and other fine cloths and exotic goods from India, Indonesia and the Far East. \nThis continual debasement had reached a point that silver content in ''Groschen''-type coins had dropped, in some cases, to less than five percent, making the coins of much less individual value than they had in the beginning.\n\nThis trend was inverted with the discovery of new and substantial silver deposits in Europe beginning in about the 1470s.\nItaly began the first tentative steps toward a large silver coinage with the introduction in 1472 of the [[lira]] [[Nicol\u00f2 Tron|tron]] in excess of {{convert|6|g|dwt|frac=8}}, a substantial increase over the roughly {{convert|4|g|dwt|adj=on|frac=8}} [[gros tournois]] of France.\nIn 1474 a {{convert|9|g|dwt|adj=on|frac=8}} lira was issued but it was in 1484 that [[Sigismund of Austria|Archduke Sigismund]] of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] issued the first truly revolutionary silver coin, the ''half Guldengroschen'' of roughly {{convert|15.5|g|dwt|frac=8}}. This was a very rare coin, almost a trial piece, but it did circulate so successfully that demand could not be met.\n\nFinally, with the silver deposits\u2014being mined at [[Schwaz]]\u2014to work with and his mint at [[Hall in Tirol|Hall]], Sigismund issued, in 1486, large numbers of the first true thaler-sized coin, the [[Guldengroschen]] (golden [[Groat (coin)|groat]], being of silver but equal in value to a Goldgulden).\n\nThe Guldengroschen, nicknamed the guldiner, was an instant and unqualified success. Soon it was being copied widely by many states who had the necessary silver. The engravers, no less affected by the [[Renaissance]] than were other artists, began creating intricate and elaborate designs featuring the heraldic arms and standards of the minting state as well as brutally realistic, sometimes unflattering, depictions of the ruler (monarch).\n\n==Joachimsthaler==\n{{See also|Tolar}}\n\nBy 1518, guldiners were popping up everywhere in central Europe. In the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], then ruled together with Hungary by [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], a guldiner was [[mint (coin)|minted]]\u2014 of similar physical size but slightly less [[fineness]]\u2014that was named in German the ''Joachimsthaler'', from the silver mined by the [[J\u00e1chymov|Counts of Schlick]] at a rich source near [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimsthal]] (St. Joachim's Valley, J\u00e1chymov \u2013 now in the [[Czech Republic]]) where ''Thal'' (Tal) means \"valley\" in German. [[Joachim]], the father of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], was portrayed on the coin along with the [[Bohemian lion]]. Similar coins began to be minted in neighbouring valleys rich in silver deposits, each named after the particular 'thal' or valley from which the silver was extracted. There were soon so many of them that these silver coins began to be known more widely as 'thaler' in German and 'tolar' in the Czech language.\n\nFrom these earliest 'thaler' developed the new thaler \u2013 the coin that the Holy Roman Empire had been looking to create as a standard for trade between the regions of Europe. The original Joachimsthaler Guldengroschen was one ounce in weight (27.2&nbsp;g). The Empire's [[Reichstaler]] (1566 to 1750) was defined as containing 400.99 grains of silver (equal to 25.984&nbsp;g) and became the [[coin of account]] of the whole Empire.\n\nIn the 17th century, some Joachimsthalers were in circulation in the [[Tsardom of Russia]], where they were called ''yefimok'' ({{lang|ru|\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043a}}) \u2013 a distortion of the name Joachim.\n\n==Holy Roman Empire==\n[[File:Wildermann thaler.jpg|thumb|17th-century thaler coin from [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] with the traditional [[woodwose]] design on coins from the mints in the [[Harz]] mountains]]\n[[File:Germany-Hamburg-1679-Half Bankportugal\u00f6ser-5 ducats.jpg|thumb|300px|Half portugal\u00f6ser (five ducats) minted in Hamburg, 1679]]\n\nThe new large silver coins that became ubiquitous as the 16th century went on were named ''thaler'' in German, while in England and France, they were named ''crown'' and ''\u00e9cu'', respectively, both names taken from what had originally been [[gold coin]]s. Thaler size silver coins minted in [[Habsburg Spain]] were named ''[[Spanish dollar|real]]''.\n\nThe zenith of thaler minting occurred in the late 16th and 17th centuries with the so-called \"multiple thalers\", often called \"l\u00f6sers\" in Germany. The first were minted in [[Duchy of Brunswick-Luneburg]], and indeed the majority were struck there. Some of these coins reached colossal size, as much as sixteen normal thalers. The original reason for minting these colossal coins, some of which exceeded a full pound (over 450&nbsp;g) of silver and being over {{convert|12|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, is uncertain. The name \"l\u00f6ser\" most likely was derived from a large gold coin minted in Hamburg called the {{ill|Portugaleser|lt=portugal\u00f6ser|de}}, worth 10 ducats, which were based on Portuguese 10-ducat coins, hence its name, and produced for commemoration, sale or by commission to institutions and individuals.<ref>[https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/gold-medallic-portugal%C3%B6ser-10-ducats/uQHONtHLqqpnww?hl=en Gold medallic portugal\u00f6ser (10 ducats)]</ref> Some of the silver l\u00f6sers reached this value, but not all. Eventually the term was applied to numerous similar coins worth more than a single thaler. These coins are very rare, the larger ones often costing tens of thousands of dollars, and are highly sought after by serious collectors of thalers. Few circulated in any real sense so they often remain in well-preserved condition.\n\nIn the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the thaler was used as the standard against which the various states' currencies could be valued. One standard also adopted by Prussia was the [[Reichsthaler]], which contained {{frac|14}} of a [[Cologne mark]] of silver. In 1754, the [[Conventionsthaler]] was introduced, containing {{frac|10}} of a Cologne mark of silver.\n\n==Dutch daalder==\nIn the Netherlands, the '''''daalder''''' and [[Dutch rijksdaalder|''rijksdaalder'']] circulated alongside the [[Dutch gulden|gulden]] at values of {{frac|1|1|2}} and {{frac|2|1|2}} gulden.\n\nThe ''kruisdaalder'' ('cross' daalder), depicting the [[Cross of Burgundy]], was prevalent in all [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch provinces]], but the currency was replaced by a new ''daalder'' after the abjuration of the Spanish king and Duke of Burgundy [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the rebellious provinces. This new coin was no longer depicting the Cross of Burgundy, but a lion, hence its Dutch name ''leeuwendaalder'' ('lion' daalder). This coin was produced from 1575 in six of the seven revolting Dutch provinces and in several Dutch cities.\n\nThe ''leeuwendaalder'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .750 fine silver and passed locally for between 32 (at introduction in 1576) to 42 [[stuiver]]s (the stuiver containing less silver over time). It was lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation, namely the [[ducatoon]] (491 grains of .920 fine silver and passing at 3 guilders or 60 ''stuivers'') and the ''[[rijksdaalder]]'' (448 grains of .885 fine silver passing at 2\u00bd guilders or 50 ''stuivers''). Clearly it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in ''leeuwendaalders'' rather than in more costly ''rijksdaalders''. Thus, the ''leeuwendaalder'' became the coin of choice for foreign trade. The coin was popular in the Middle East, the colonies in the east and in the west. It even was the origin for the names of the [[Romanian Leu]].\n\nProduction stopped after the introduction of the new silver coinage based on the ''gulden'' by Holland in 1680. This also contained a half 3 ''gulden'' of 30 ''stuiver'', which remained to be called ''Daalder'' in common speech. Even 200 years after the coin disappeared from circulation, ''daalder'' was used as term for an amount of {{frac|1|1|2}} gulden (for instance in the commercial jingle \"at the market your ''gulden'' is worth a ''daalder''\").\n\nFrom [[New Netherland]] (New York) the ''leeuwendaalder'' or 'lion dollar' spread to all [[Thirteen Colonies]]. The term was later applied to a coin used in the Spanish American colonies, which was also widely used in the British North American colonies at the time of the [[American Revolution]], and adopted as the name of the US monetary unit in the late 18th century. Hence the ''leeuwendaalder'' became the namesake of the [[American dollar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/DutchCoins.html |title=Production of the Leeuwendaalder |website=www.coins.nd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=Lion Dollar \u2013 Introduction |website=www.coins.nd.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch ''leeuwendaalder'' (German ''L\u00f6wenthaler'') was imitated in several German and Italian cities. These coins circulated in Romania and gave their name to the currencies of Romania and Moldova, the ''leu'', and of Bulgaria, the ''leva'', which literally translates to \"lion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leu&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, the name ''rijksdaalder'' lived on until the ''gulden'' was replaced by the [[euro]] in 2002.

Various daler circulated, including the [[Danish rigsdaler]], the [[Swedish riksdaler]] and the [[Norwegian speciedaler]]. These daler circulated in Denmark and Sweden until 1873 when they were replaced by the [[Danish krone]] and [[Swedish krona]], the new currencies introduced by the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]]. Norway joined the Monetary Union and introduced the [[Norwegian krone]] in 1876.\n\n==19th-century Germany==\nIn 1837, the [[Prussian thaler]] became part of a currency union which set the value of the southern German gulden at {{frac|1|3|4}} per thaler. By 1850, nearly all German states used this standard of Thaler, though with differing subdivisions.\n\n[[File:Hungary-thaler-leopold-1692.png|thumb|300px|Thaler of Holy Roman Empire [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] minted in 1692]]\n\nIn 1857, the [[Vereinsthaler]] was adopted by most German states as well as in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. Vereinsthalers were issued until 1871 in Germany and 1867 in Austria. Within the new German Empire, vereinsthaler coins circulated as 3-mark pieces until 1908 when they were withdrawn and demonetized. Some old countermarked thalers circulated as emergency coinage in Germany during the inflationary period following its defeat in the First World War.\n\nThe [[Maria Theresa thaler]] was still used during the 20th century in [[Horn of Africa]], [[Eastern Africa]], [[India]] and throughout much of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].\n\n==Other \"thaler\"==\n[[File:Nikola III. Zrinski (1489-1534.).JPG|thumb|200px|Prince [[Nikola III Zrinski]] thaler minted in [[Gvozdansko]] castle, [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], in the early 16th century (until 1534)]]\nAs silver flooded into the European economy from domestic and overseas sources, thalers and thaler-sized coins were minted all over with equivalent coins such as the [[Crown (British coin)|crown]], daalder from which the English word \"dollar\" is derived, [[Swedish krona|krona]], and from 1598, the Spanish [[eight real coin]] was minted (known as the pirate's \"piece of eight\") \u2014 a coin which would later become known in some parts of the world as the [[peso]]. Indeed, in England the word \"dollar\" was in use for the thaler for 200 years before the issue of the [[United States dollar]], and until the half crown ceased to be used following [[decimalisation]] in 1971, the term \"half a dollar\" could be heard for \"half a crown\". In Switzerland and Germany, coins were minted to commemorate ''[[Sch\u00fctzenfest]]e'' (\"Marksmen's festivals\"). These are commonly known as \"[[Shooting thaler]]s\".\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Thaler.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of German and Austrian thalers compared to a U.S. [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] (bottom center)]]\n{{see|Bullion_coin#Silver}}\n\nThe [[Latin Monetary Union]] of 1865&ndash;1927 attempted to standardise European silver coins, \nintroducing a debasement from 90% to 83.5% silver because rising silver prices had led to the face value of silver coins being exceeded by the metal value. \nThe thaler size silver coin of the [[French franc]] was the 5-francs coin, also known as ''[[\u00e9cu]]'', which was last minted in 1879. The United States continued to mint silver dollar coins until the 1930, and the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]], originally based on the French 5 francs coin, continued to be minted in silver until 1969. \n\nSilver [[commemorative coins]] in thaler size, not intended for circulation as regular currency, became popular in the 17th to 18th centuries. Notable examples include the ''Gluckhennentaler'' of [[Basel]] (1645) and the ''Luftpumpentaler'' of 1702 (commemorating the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment). ''M\u00fcnzbesuchstaler'' are thaler coins minted to commemorate a visit to the mint by the regent, a German tradition beginning in the 1850s.\nSome modern silver [[commemorative coins]] minted in German-speaking Europe are given the name ''Taler'', such as\nSwiss ''[[Sch\u00fctzentaler]]'', the Swiss ''Helvetia-Taler'' minted in yearly intervals since 1992,  the Austrian ''Haller-Taler'' of 1986.\n\nThe German ''[[Vereinsthaler]]'' was abolished in 1871, with the introduction of the [[German gold mark]], with the exchange rate of 3 ''Mark'' to one ''Taler''. The [[German_gold_mark#Silver_coins|3 Mark coin]], at 15 g silver, was colloquially called ''Taler''.\nIn Greece, the term ''taliro'' ({{lang|el|\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf}}) is commonly used for the denomination of five of the local currency (5 drachmae or 5 euros). This reflects the fact that, when introduced in 1833, the new Greek currency, the [[drachma]], corresponded to {{frac|5}} of the value of one thaler, the latter coin thus being equivalent to the 5-drachma coin. The term is still used for the 5-euro banknote.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[Bullion coin]]s are coins minted by national mints which are nominally legal tender but not intended for normal circulation, with a face value that harks back to the currency values of the early 20th century. Silver bullion coins are often minted at one ounce and thus roughly of thaler size. The first such bullion coin was the Mexican ''onza'' of 1949.\nAnother example is the [[American Silver Eagle]] of 1986, minted to the specifications of a pre-1935 silver dollar coin.\n\nUnrelated to specific coins, the name of the ''thaler'' survives in various modern currency names, in the form ''dollar'' in  twenty-three currencies   used in countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States of America, \nand in the Slovenian form ''[[Slovenian tolar|tolar]]'' until 2006.\nIn 2017 a [[cryptocurrency]] named [[Taler (cryptocurrency)|Taler]] was launched in [[Belarus]] as a legal payment instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://russian.rt.com/ussr/article/437925-belorussiya-kriptovalyuta-taler|title=\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043e-\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438: \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043c \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442\u0443|website=RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c}}</ref>\n\n==Chronology of thaler development==\n {{multiple image\n | width = 100\n | footer = Maria Theresia Kronenthaler in 1770\n | image1 = 1770 Burgundian Cross scan4036.jpg\n | caption1 = Burgundian Cross with 4 crowns\n | image2 = 1770 Kronenthaler scan4039.jpg\n | caption2 = Eagle and arms\n }}\n* 1486: [[Sigismund of Austria|Sigismund]] of Tirol issues his 31.93 g [[Guldengroschen]] of 60 [[Kreuzer]]s and .9375 fineness.\n* 1493: Switzerland issues its first Guldengroschen at [[Bern]]\n* 1499: Hungary issues the first Guldiner/Guldengroschen. It is the earliest year of issue with Arabic numerals on the coins in Hungary.\n* 1500: The first German Guldengroschen is issued from [[Saxony]], with a value of 24 [[Groschen]]. In Bremen it circulates equivalent to 36 Groten. These Guldengroschen are reduced in weight to 29.2 g so as to be minted at eight coins to the Cologne mark.\n* 1518: The first coin actually called a \"Thaler\" is minted in [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimsthal]], Bohemia, Holy Roman Empire. Its weight is as the standard of 1500.\n* 1524: In an attempt to standardise the guldiner, a money ordinance (Reichsm\u00fcnzordnung) is issued at [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], Germany reaffirming the fineness of the coin at 937.5, and its weight to 29.2 g.\n* 1534: Saxony and Bohemia alter the fineness of their guldiners down from .9375 purity to .903 while maintaining the same coin weight, thus lowering the actual amount of pure silver in the coin. This begins a separation of the Thaler from its guldiner ancestry.\n* 1551: A new money ordinance is decreed in [[Augsburg]] that lowers the guldiner's purity to .882, but raises the weight of the coin to 31.18 g. This returns the coin to being the equal value of a Goldgulden. The Thaler is now equivalent to 72 Kreuzer.\n* 1559: After the death of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], yet another money ordinance is decreed at Augsburg, this time radically altering the coin (now to be called a Reichsguldiner) down to a mass of just 24.62 g, but returning the coin to .931 fineness. This sets the Guldiner to be equivalent to 60 Kreuzer once again.\n* 1566: The guldiner as a denomination is more or less eliminated by a Saxon money edict that establishes the Reichsthaler (known later as the Speciesthaler) with a fineness of 889.0 and a weight of 29.2 g.\n* 1667: An agreement made at the [[Zinna Abbey|Abbey of Zinna]] between Saxony, [[Brandenburg]], and [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] to help make the minting of small coins more economical than could be done under the old Augsburg ordinances led to the Thaler being reduced in weight to 28.1 g but retaining the same .889 fineness.\n* 1690: The Leipzig Money Convention met to deal with the poor quality of coinage in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Brunswick. The agreement of 1667 had not solved the problem so the thaler was again reduced in weight down to 25.9 g. At this point 12 Thaler are being minted to provide one Cologne mark of silver, up from nine in 1500.\n* 1750: This year saw yet another reduction in weight in the areas controlled by [[Prussia]], [[Hesse]], and [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] down to just 22.2 g and a .750 fineness. 14 thalers are minted to contain one Cologne mark of silver.\n* 1754: The monetary agreement between Austria and Bavaria in 1753 began the period of the [[Conventionsthaler]], a thaler set at 10 to equal one Cologne Mark of silver. Its weight was 28.0 g with a fineness of .833. Over time this coin spread into a large portion of central and southern Germany.\n* 1755: The Kronenthaler (a thaler with 3 or 4 crowns between the Burgundy cross) is first issued in areas controlled by the Habsburgs, especially in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (present-day Belgium) and southern Germany. It had a weight of 29.44 g and a fineness of .873.\n* 1857: The Vienna monetary contract finally eliminates the Cologne Mark as a standard against which the silver coinage of Austria and Germany are reckoned, replacing it with a simple tariff of 500 g.

A ''thaler'' size silver coin has a diameter of about 40 mm and a weight of about 25 to 30 grams, or roughly [[avoirdupois ounce|1 ounce]].\n\nThe word is shortened from ''Joachimsthaler'', the original ''thaler'' coin minted in [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimstal]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], from 1518.\nAfter the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German ''Reichstaler'' survived in the form of the [[Prussian thaler]] (later ''[[Vereinsthaler]]'') until 1871.\n\nIts name lives on in the many currencies called ''[[dollar]]'' and the [[Samoan t\u0101l\u0101]], and, until 2007, also in the [[Slovenian tolar]].\nThe ''thaler'' silver coin type continued to be minted as legal tender of modern currencies, such as the US [[ Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] (until 1935) and the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]] (until 1969).\nMany government mints continue to issue thaler sized silver coins with face values in national currency, now known as [[Bullion_coin#Silver|bullion coins]], as their silver value significantly exceeds the face value.\n\n==Etymology==\nGerman ''taler'' is recorded from the 1530, as an abbreviation of ''Joachimstaler''. The mines at [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimstal]] having had opened in 1516, and the first such coins were minted there in 1518.\nThe original spelling was ''taler'' (so [[Erasmus Alberus|Alberus]] 1540).\nGerman ''-taler'' means \"of the valley\" (c.f. ''[[Neanderthal#Etymology|Neanderthaler]]'').\nBy the late 16th century, the word was variously spelled as German ''taler'', ''toler'', ''thaler'', ''thaller''; Low German ''daler'', ''dahler''.\nIn 19th-century German orthography, ''Thaler'' became standard, changed to ''Taler'' in the  [[German Orthographic Conference of 1901|1902 spelling reform]].\n\nThe name ''thaler'' soon came to be used as a suffix denoting various types of silver coins of thaler size, \nthus\n''Kreuzthaler'', ''Albertusthaler'' (1612), ''Kronenthaler'' (1755), ''Kaubthaler'', ''Ortsthaler'', ''[[Reichsthaler]]'' (1566), ''Silberthaler'', ''[[Sch\u00fctzenthaler]]'', ''Laubthaler'' (1726), ''[[Conventionsthaler]]'' (1754), ''Bankthaler'',  ''Spesciesthaler'' (etc.).\nThe  Dutch {{lang|nl|daalders}} also carried the picture of a lion, which gave them the name {{lang|nl|leeuwendaalder}} (\"lion thaler\", 1575).  \nFrom 1750, German ''Thaler'' predominantly refers to the [[Prussian thaler|Prussian ''Reichsthaler'']] (1750&ndash;1857), \nafter 1857 the ''[[Vereinsthaler]]'' (in 1871 replaced by the ''[[German gold mark|Mark]]'').\n\nThe corresponding English silver coin of the period was the ''[[Crown (English coin)|crown]]''. \nThe Low German word was adopted in English as ''daler'' by 1550, modified to ''dollar'' by about 1600.\n<ref>Christian Ludwig, ''Teutsch-Englisches Lexicon'' (1789), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=DCj8dJG29fgC&pg=RA1-PA447 c.448] gives ''dollar, doller'' as the English translation of ''Thaler''.</ref>\nEnglish ''thaler'' was introduced in the first half of the 19th century to refer to the coins of the German states, as the word ''dollar'' was increasingly understood to refer to the [[United States dollar]].\n\n==Predecessors==\nThe development of large silver coins is an innovation of the beginning [[Early Modern period]].\nThe largest medieval silver coins were known as [[Groat (coin)|groat]] (German ''Groschen''), from ''denarius grossus'' or \"thick penny\". These rarely exceeded a weight of 6 grams.\nIn the late 15th century, even these coins were increasingly debased, as a general silver shortage developed in Europe for a number of reasons, induced by the costs of continual warfare, and by the incessant centuries-long loss of silver and gold in indirect one-sided trades importing [[spice]]s, [[porcelain]], [[silk]] and other fine cloths and exotic goods from India, Indonesia and the Far East. \nThis continual debasement had reached a point that silver content in ''Groschen''-type coins had dropped, in some cases, to less than five percent, making the coins of much less individual value than they had in the beginning.\n\nThis trend was inverted with the discovery of new and substantial silver deposits in Europe beginning in about the 1470s.\nItaly began the first tentative steps toward a large silver coinage with the introduction in 1472 of the [[lira]] [[Nicol\u00f2 Tron|tron]] in excess of {{convert|6|g|dwt|frac=8}}, a substantial increase over the roughly {{convert|4|g|dwt|adj=on|frac=8}} [[gros tournois]] of France.\nIn 1474 a {{convert|9|g|dwt|adj=on|frac=8}} lira was issued but it was in 1484 that [[Sigismund of Austria|Archduke Sigismund]] of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] issued the first truly revolutionary silver coin, the ''half Guldengroschen'' of roughly {{convert|15.5|g|dwt|frac=8}}. This was a very rare coin, almost a trial piece, but it did circulate so successfully that demand could not be met.\n\nFinally, with the silver deposits\u2014being mined at [[Schwaz]]\u2014to work with and his mint at [[Hall in Tirol|Hall]], Sigismund issued, in 1486, large numbers of the first true thaler-sized coin, the [[Guldengroschen]] (golden [[Groat (coin)|groat]], being of silver but equal in value to a Goldgulden).\n\nThe Guldengroschen, nicknamed the guldiner, was an instant and unqualified success. Soon it was being copied widely by many states who had the necessary silver. The engravers, no less affected by the [[Renaissance]] than were other artists, began creating intricate and elaborate designs featuring the heraldic arms and standards of the minting state as well as brutally realistic, sometimes unflattering, depictions of the ruler (monarch).\n\n==Joachimsthaler==\n{{See also|Tolar}}\n\nBy 1518, guldiners were popping up everywhere in central Europe. In the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], then ruled together with Hungary by [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], a guldiner was [[mint (coin)|minted]]\u2014 of similar physical size but slightly less [[fineness]]\u2014that was named in German the ''Joachimsthaler'', from the silver mined by the [[J\u00e1chymov|Counts of Schlick]] at a rich source near [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimsthal]] (St. Joachim's Valley, J\u00e1chymov \u2013 now in the [[Czech Republic]]) where ''Thal'' (Tal) means \"valley\" in German. [[Joachim]], the father of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], was portrayed on the coin along with the [[Bohemian lion]]. Similar coins began to be minted in neighbouring valleys rich in silver deposits, each named after the particular 'thal' or valley from which the silver was extracted. There were soon so many of them that these silver coins began to be known more widely as 'thaler' in German and 'tolar' in the Czech language.\n\nFrom these earliest 'thaler' developed the new thaler \u2013 the coin that the Holy Roman Empire had been looking to create as a standard for trade between the regions of Europe. The original Joachimsthaler Guldengroschen was one ounce in weight (27.2&nbsp;g). The Empire's [[Reichstaler]] (1566 to 1750) was defined as containing 400.99 grains of silver (equal to 25.984&nbsp;g) and became the [[coin of account]] of the whole Empire.\n\nIn the 17th century, some Joachimsthalers were in circulation in the [[Tsardom of Russia]], where they were called ''yefimok'' ({{lang|ru|\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043a}}) \u2013 a distortion of the name Joachim.\n\n==Holy Roman Empire==\n[[File:Wildermann thaler.jpg|thumb|17th-century thaler coin from [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] with the traditional [[woodwose]] design on coins from the mints in the [[Harz]] mountains]]\n[[File:Germany-Hamburg-1679-Half Bankportugal\u00f6ser-5 ducats.jpg|thumb|300px|Half portugal\u00f6ser (five ducats) minted in Hamburg, 1679]]\n\nThe new large silver coins that became ubiquitous as the 16th century went on were named ''thaler'' in German, while in England and France, they were named ''crown'' and ''\u00e9cu'', respectively, both names taken from what had originally been [[gold coin]]s. Thaler size silver coins minted in [[Habsburg Spain]] were named ''[[Spanish dollar|real]]''.\n\nThe zenith of thaler minting occurred in the late 16th and 17th centuries with the so-called \"multiple thalers\", often called \"l\u00f6sers\" in Germany. The first were minted in [[Duchy of Brunswick-Luneburg]], and indeed the majority were struck there. Some of these coins reached colossal size, as much as sixteen normal thalers. The original reason for minting these colossal coins, some of which exceeded a full pound (over 450&nbsp;g) of silver and being over {{convert|12|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, is uncertain. The name \"l\u00f6ser\" most likely was derived from a large gold coin minted in Hamburg called the {{ill|Portugaleser|lt=portugal\u00f6ser|de}}, worth 10 ducats, which were based on Portuguese 10-ducat coins, hence its name, and produced for commemoration, sale or by commission to institutions and individuals.<ref>[https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/gold-medallic-portugal%C3%B6ser-10-ducats/uQHONtHLqqpnww?hl=en Gold medallic portugal\u00f6ser (10 ducats)]</ref> Some of the silver l\u00f6sers reached this value, but not all. Eventually the term was applied to numerous similar coins worth more than a single thaler. These coins are very rare, the larger ones often costing tens of thousands of dollars, and are highly sought after by serious collectors of thalers. Few circulated in any real sense so they often remain in well-preserved condition.\n\nIn the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the thaler was used as the standard against which the various states' currencies could be valued. One standard also adopted by Prussia was the [[Reichsthaler]], which contained {{frac|14}} of a [[Cologne mark]] of silver. In 1754, the [[Conventionsthaler]] was introduced, containing {{frac|10}} of a Cologne mark of silver.\n\n==Dutch daalder==\nIn the Netherlands, the '''''daalder''''' and [[Dutch rijksdaalder|''rijksdaalder'']] circulated alongside the [[Dutch gulden|gulden]] at values of {{frac|1|1|2}} and {{frac|2|1|2}} gulden.\n\nThe ''kruisdaalder'' ('cross' daalder), depicting the [[Cross of Burgundy]], was prevalent in all [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch provinces]], but the currency was replaced by a new ''daalder'' after the abjuration of the Spanish king and Duke of Burgundy [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the rebellious provinces. This new coin was no longer depicting the Cross of Burgundy, but a lion, hence its Dutch name ''leeuwendaalder'' ('lion' daalder). This coin was produced from 1575 in six of the seven revolting Dutch provinces and in several Dutch cities.\n\nThe ''leeuwendaalder'' was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .750 fine silver and passed locally for between 32 (at introduction in 1576) to 42 [[stuiver]]s (the stuiver containing less silver over time). It was lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation, namely the [[ducatoon]] (491 grains of .920 fine silver and passing at 3 guilders or 60 ''stuivers'') and the ''[[rijksdaalder]]'' (448 grains of .885 fine silver passing at 2\u00bd guilders or 50 ''stuivers''). Clearly it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in ''leeuwendaalders'' rather than in more costly ''rijksdaalders''. Thus, the ''leeuwendaalder'' became the coin of choice for foreign trade. The coin was popular in the Middle East, the colonies in the east and in the west. It even was the origin for the names of the [[Romanian Leu]].\n\nProduction stopped after the introduction of the new silver coinage based on the ''gulden'' by Holland in 1680. This also contained a half 3 ''gulden'' of 30 ''stuiver'', which remained to be called ''Daalder'' in common speech. Even 200 years after the coin disappeared from circulation, ''daalder'' was used as term for an amount of {{frac|1|1|2}} gulden (for instance in the commercial jingle \"at the market your ''gulden'' is worth a ''daalder''\").\n\nFrom [[New Netherland]] (New York) the ''leeuwendaalder'' or 'lion dollar' spread to all [[Thirteen Colonies]]. The term was later applied to a coin used in the Spanish American colonies, which was also widely used in the British North American colonies at the time of the [[American Revolution]], and adopted as the name of the US monetary unit in the late 18th century. Hence the ''leeuwendaalder'' became the namesake of the [[American dollar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/DutchCoins.html |title=Production of the Leeuwendaalder |website=www.coins.nd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Lion-Dollar.intro.html |title=Lion Dollar \u2013 Introduction |website=www.coins.nd.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch ''leeuwendaalder'' (German ''L\u00f6wenthaler'') was imitated in several German and Italian cities. These coins circulated in Romania and gave their name to the currencies of Romania and Moldova, the ''leu'', and of Bulgaria, the ''leva'', which literally translates to \"lion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leu&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, the name ''rijksdaalder'' lived on until the ''gulden'' was replaced by the [[euro]] in 2002.

Various daler circulated, including the [[Danish rigsdaler]], the [[Swedish riksdaler]] and the [[Norwegian speciedaler]]. These daler circulated in Denmark and Sweden until 1873 when they were replaced by the [[Danish krone]] and [[Swedish krona]], the new currencies introduced by the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]]. Norway joined the Monetary Union and introduced the [[Norwegian krone]] in 1876.\n\n==19th-century Germany==\nIn 1837, the [[Prussian thaler]] became part of a currency union which set the value of the southern German gulden at {{frac|1|3|4}} per thaler. By 1850, nearly all German states used this standard of Thaler, though with differing subdivisions.\n\n[[File:Hungary-thaler-leopold-1692.png|thumb|300px|Thaler of Holy Roman Empire [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] minted in 1692]]\n\nIn 1857, the [[Vereinsthaler]] was adopted by most German states as well as in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. Vereinsthalers were issued until 1871 in Germany and 1867 in Austria. Within the new German Empire, vereinsthaler coins circulated as 3-mark pieces until 1908 when they were withdrawn and demonetized. Some old countermarked thalers circulated as emergency coinage in Germany during the inflationary period following its defeat in the First World War.\n\nThe [[Maria Theresa thaler]] was still used during the 20th century in [[Horn of Africa]], [[Eastern Africa]], [[India]] and throughout much of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].\n\n==Other \"thaler\"==\n[[File:Nikola III. Zrinski (1489-1534.).JPG|thumb|200px|Prince [[Nikola III Zrinski]] thaler minted in [[Gvozdansko]] castle, [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], in the early 16th century (until 1534)]]\nAs silver flooded into the European economy from domestic and overseas sources, thalers and thaler-sized coins were minted all over with equivalent coins such as the [[Crown (British coin)|crown]], daalder from which the English word \"dollar\" is derived, [[Swedish krona|krona]], and from 1598, the Spanish [[eight real coin]] was minted (known as the pirate's \"piece of eight\") \u2014 a coin which would later become known in some parts of the world as the [[peso]]. Indeed, in England the word \"dollar\" was in use for the thaler for 200 years before the issue of the [[United States dollar]], and until the half crown ceased to be used following [[decimalisation]] in 1971, the term \"half a dollar\" could be heard for \"half a crown\". In Switzerland and Germany, coins were minted to commemorate ''[[Sch\u00fctzenfest]]e'' (\"Marksmen's festivals\"). These are commonly known as \"[[Shooting thaler]]s\".\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Thaler.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of German and Austrian thalers compared to a U.S. [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] (bottom center)]]\n{{see|Bullion_coin#Silver}}\n\nThe [[Latin Monetary Union]] of 1865&ndash;1927 attempted to standardise European silver coins, \nintroducing a debasement from 90% to 83.5% silver because rising silver prices had led to the face value of silver coins being exceeded by the metal value. \nThe thaler size silver coin of the [[French franc]] was the 5-francs coin, also known as ''[[\u00e9cu]]'', which was last minted in 1879. The United States continued to mint silver dollar coins until the 1930, and the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]], originally based on the French 5 francs coin, continued to be minted in silver until 1969. \n\nSilver [[commemorative coins]] in thaler size, not intended for circulation as regular currency, became popular in the 17th to 18th centuries. Notable examples include the ''Gluckhennentaler'' of [[Basel]] (1645) and the ''Luftpumpentaler'' of 1702 (commemorating the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment). ''M\u00fcnzbesuchstaler'' are thaler coins minted to commemorate a visit to the mint by the regent, a German tradition beginning in the 1850s.\nSome modern silver [[commemorative coins]] minted in German-speaking Europe are given the name ''Taler'', such as\nSwiss ''[[Sch\u00fctzentaler]]'', the Swiss ''Helvetia-Taler'' minted in yearly intervals since 1992,  the Austrian ''Haller-Taler'' of 1986.\n\nThe German ''[[Vereinsthaler]]'' was abolished in 1871, with the introduction of the [[German gold mark]], with the exchange rate of 3 ''Mark'' to one ''Taler''. The [[German_gold_mark#Silver_coins|3 Mark coin]], at 15 g silver, was colloquially called ''Taler''.\nIn Greece, the term ''taliro'' ({{lang|el|\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf}}) is commonly used for the denomination of five of the local currency (5 drachmae or 5 euros). This reflects the fact that, when introduced in 1833, the new Greek currency, the [[drachma]], corresponded to {{frac|5}} of the value of one thaler, the latter coin thus being equivalent to the 5-drachma coin. The term is still used for the 5-euro banknote.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[Bullion coin]]s are coins minted by national mints which are nominally legal tender but not intended for normal circulation, with a face value that harks back to the currency values of the early 20th century. Silver bullion coins are often minted at one ounce and thus roughly of thaler size. The first such bullion coin was the Mexican ''onza'' of 1949.\nAnother example is the [[American Silver Eagle]] of 1986, minted to the specifications of a pre-1935 silver dollar coin.\n\nUnrelated to specific coins, the name of the ''thaler'' survives in various modern currency names, in the form ''dollar'' in  twenty-three currencies   used in countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States of America, \nand in the Slovenian form ''[[Slovenian tolar|tolar]]'' until 2006.\nIn 2017 a [[cryptocurrency]] named [[Taler (cryptocurrency)|Taler]] was launched in [[Belarus]] as a legal payment instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://russian.rt.com/ussr/article/437925-belorussiya-kriptovalyuta-taler|title=\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043e-\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438: \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043c \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442\u0443|website=RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c}}</ref>\n\n==Chronology of thaler development==\n {{multiple image\n | width = 100\n | footer = Maria Theresia Kronenthaler in 1770\n | image1 = 1770 Burgundian Cross scan4036.jpg\n | caption1 = Burgundian Cross with 4 crowns\n | image2 = 1770 Kronenthaler scan4039.jpg\n | caption2 = Eagle and arms\n }}\n* 1486: [[Sigismund of Austria|Sigismund]] of Tirol issues his 31.93 g [[Guldengroschen]] of 60 [[Kreuzer]]s and .9375 fineness.\n* 1493: Switzerland issues its first Guldengroschen at [[Bern]]\n* 1499: Hungary issues the first Guldiner/Guldengroschen. It is the earliest year of issue with Arabic numerals on the coins in Hungary.\n* 1500: The first German Guldengroschen is issued from [[Saxony]], with a value of 24 [[Groschen]]. In Bremen it circulates equivalent to 36 Groten. These Guldengroschen are reduced in weight to 29.2 g so as to be minted at eight coins to the Cologne mark.\n* 1518: The first coin actually called a \"Thaler\" is minted in [[J\u00e1chymov|Joachimsthal]], Bohemia, Holy Roman Empire. Its weight is as the standard of 1500.\n* 1524: In an attempt to standardise the guldiner, a money ordinance (Reichsm\u00fcnzordnung) is issued at [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], Germany reaffirming the fineness of the coin at 937.5, and its weight to 29.2 g.\n* 1534: Saxony and Bohemia alter the fineness of their guldiners down from .9375 purity to .903 while maintaining the same coin weight, thus lowering the actual amount of pure silver in the coin. This begins a separation of the Thaler from its guldiner ancestry.\n* 1551: A new money ordinance is decreed in [[Augsburg]] that lowers the guldiner's purity to .882, but raises the weight of the coin to 31.18 g. This returns the coin to being the equal value of a Goldgulden. The Thaler is now equivalent to 72 Kreuzer.\n* 1559: After the death of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], yet another money ordinance is decreed at Augsburg, this time radically altering the coin (now to be called a Reichsguldiner) down to a mass of just 24.62 g, but returning the coin to .931 fineness. This sets the Guldiner to be equivalent to 60 Kreuzer once again.\n* 1566: The guldiner as a denomination is more or less eliminated by a Saxon money edict that establishes the Reichsthaler (known later as the Speciesthaler) with a fineness of 889.0 and a weight of 29.2 g.\n* 1667: An agreement made at the [[Zinna Abbey|Abbey of Zinna]] between Saxony, [[Brandenburg]], and [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] to help make the minting of small coins more economical than could be done under the old Augsburg ordinances led to the Thaler being reduced in weight to 28.1 g but retaining the same .889 fineness.\n* 1690: The Leipzig Money Convention met to deal with the poor quality of coinage in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Brunswick. The agreement of 1667 had not solved the problem so the thaler was again reduced in weight down to 25.9 g. At this point 12 Thaler are being minted to provide one Cologne mark of silver, up from nine in 1500.\n* 1750: This year saw yet another reduction in weight in the areas controlled by [[Prussia]], [[Hesse]], and [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] down to just 22.2 g and a .750 fineness. 14 thalers are minted to contain one Cologne mark of silver.\n* 1754: The monetary agreement between Austria and Bavaria in 1753 began the period of the [[Conventionsthaler]], a thaler set at 10 to equal one Cologne Mark of silver. Its weight was 28.0 g with a fineness of .833. Over time this coin spread into a large portion of central and southern Germany.\n* 1755: The Kronenthaler (a thaler with 3 or 4 crowns between the Burgundy cross) is first issued in areas controlled by the Habsburgs, especially in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (present-day Belgium) and southern Germany. It had a weight of 29.44 g and a fineness of .873.\n* 1857: The Vienna monetary contract finally eliminates the Cologne Mark as a standard against which the silver coinage of Austria and Germany are reckoned, replacing it with a simple tariff of 500 g. Thirty [[Vereinsthaler]]s are set to be minted from this 500 g standard. The coins weighed 18.5 g and had a .900 fineness. They are set to equal 90 Austrian Kreuzer, 105 Bavarian Kreuzer, 30 Groschen, or 48 Schilling depending on the minting region.\n* 1872: The last thalers are minted in a few states, notably Saxony.\n* 1908: The last circulating thalers were withdrawn and demonetised in Germany. \n* Early years of 20th century: unsuccessful attempt to mint [[Maria Theresa thaler]] in [[Ethiopia]] (Also referred to as 'Abyssinia'). Starting in 1935 Italians mint the coin still popular in the area.<ref name=\"bagman\">{{cite book | first = Joseph | last = [[Joseph Kalmer|Kalmer]] |author2=Hyun L.  | title= Abessinien | year = 1935 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics}}\n* [[Groschen]]\n* [[Kronenthaler]]\n* [[Maria Theresa thaler]]\n* [[Reichsthaler]]\n* [[Vereinsthaler]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Books  ==\n*{{cite book |last=Duve |first=Gebhard |date=1966 |title=HISTORY OF THE REDEEMABLE, MULTIPLE AND MINING TALERS OF BRUNSWICK-LUNEBERG |location=Johannseburg |publisher=Duve}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons-inline|Thaler}}\n\n{{Thaler}}\n\n[[Category:Thaler| ]]\n[[Category:Coins of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Germany]]\n[[Category:Denominations (currency)]]\n[[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]\n", "name_user": "Dbachmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEtymology", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaler"}

She picks a mobile phone up and hears [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] announce \"Welcome to the final problem\".\n\n[[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft Holmes]] is at home, where Sherlock and Watson disable his home security to trick him into revealing that his sister, [[Eurus Holmes|Eurus]], exists.  At 221B Baker Street, Mycroft explains that Eurus was an era-defining genius on a par with [[Isaac Newton]], with abilities far greater than Sherlock's and Mycroft's, coupled with a total lack of normal sensation and emotion. Mycroft reveals that their parents sent Eurus to a mental institution after she kidnapped and drowned Sherlock's dog Redbeard, and after she burned their home down. Mycroft withheld this from Sherlock because Eurus had psychologically traumatized him as a child, taunting him with an enigmatic song, and leading to Sherlock [[Memory suppression|suppressing his memories]] of her. An adult Mycroft then sent her to a [[Prison#Security levels|maximum-security facility]] in the [[North Sea]], Sherrinford, and told their parents that she had died. When Mycroft insists that she is secured, a [[quadcopter]] carrying a motion-activated grenade flies into Sherlock's flat. John, Sherlock, and Mycroft flee as the bomb detonates, blasting Holmes and Watson out of the windows.\n\nLater, John and Sherlock hijack a fishing trawler to travel to Sherrinford, carrying out a diversionary plan so that Sherlock can reach Eurus' cell. Mycroft and John corner the prison governor, discovering that he has explicitly disobeyed Mycroft's protocol and has allowed Eurus to interact with prison staff. Using her skill to \"reprogram\" everyone she speaks with, Eurus has effectively taken full control of the prison. Meanwhile, Sherlock talks to Eurus, but she attacks him and knocks him unconscious. The guards lock Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and the governor together in Eurus's old cell.\n\nMycroft reveals that five years before, he granted Eurus an unsupervised interview with Moriarty as a Christmas present in exchange for detecting national security threats to Britain. During that time, Moriarty agreed to record video messages for her. After forcing the governor to commit suicide, Eurus torments Sherlock, Mycroft and Watson in a series of psychological ordeals, forcing Sherlock into sinister games to save their lives while videos of Moriarty heckle him. Although Eurus forces Sherlock onward with the prospect of saving the girl on the aeroplane, he eventually stops the games by threatening to shoot himself when she orders him to shoot either John or Mycroft. Furious, Eurus uses tranquilliser darts on the three of them.\n\nSherlock wakes up near the burnt-out wreckage of his family's old house. He speaks to the girl in the aeroplane to try to guide her in landing safely. John wakes up chained at the bottom of a well. As Eurus raises the water level in the well, John finds a human skull there, and Sherlock realizes that what he thought was his dog Redbeard was in fact his childhood friend, Victor Trevor. Eurus threw him into the well and left him for dead because she felt left out of Sherlock's attention as a child. Sherlock then deciphers the real meaning of the song that Eurus originally taunted him with when Victor went missing, which reveals that she wants him to find her. Sherlock deduces that the girl in the plane is actually Eurus's mental metaphor and that the game has been a cry for help. With Eurus' puzzle solved, Sherlock is able to send her back to Sherrinford after rescuing John.\n\nMycroft explains to his and Sherlock's parents, who are angry that they had been told that Eurus was dead, that she refuses to speak to people anymore. Sherlock visits her and they play the violin together, giving performances for their parents and Mycroft. While helping Sherlock repair his destroyed flat, John receives a video sent by Mary before she died, encouraging him to continue working with Sherlock.\n\n== Sources ==\nThe title of the episode is a reference to \"[[The Final Problem]]\" (1893).<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/sherlock/261522/sherlock-38-things-you-might-have-missed-in-the-final-problem|title=Sherlock: 38 Things You Might Have Missed in The Final Problem|author=Louisa Mellor|date=17 January 2017|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]}}</ref> The episode was partially based on \"[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]\" (1893), which it directly references.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/><ref>'Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel', Jane Stanford, Carrowmore, pps. 87,88.</ref> Watson's mention of the east wind and the name of Eurus Holmes are a reference to \"[[His Last Bow (short story)|His Last Bow]]\" (1917), where Holmes says, \"There's an east wind coming, Watson.\" The three Garrideb brothers seen in a puzzle sequence are an adaptation of \"[[The Adventure of the Three Garridebs]]\" (1924).<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> The character Victor Trevor is a reference to \"[[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott|The Adventure of the ''Gloria Scott'']]\" (1893), where he appears as Holmes' first ever close friend, albeit in university rather than in childhood.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> Jim Moriarty's brother is mentioned as a [[Radio station|broadcast station]] master, a reference to ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'' (1915), where [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]]'s brother is noted to be a [[station master|railway station master]].<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> The message on the coffin lid is a reference to \"[[The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax]]\" (1911).

She picks a mobile phone up and hears [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] announce \"Welcome to the final problem\".\n\n[[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft Holmes]] is at home, where Sherlock and Watson disable his home security to trick him into revealing that his sister, [[Eurus Holmes|Eurus]], exists.  At 221B Baker Street, Mycroft explains that Eurus was an era-defining genius on a par with [[Isaac Newton]], with abilities far greater than Sherlock's and Mycroft's, coupled with a total lack of normal sensation and emotion. Mycroft reveals that their parents sent Eurus to a mental institution after she kidnapped and drowned Sherlock's dog Redbeard, and after she burned their home down. Mycroft withheld this from Sherlock because Eurus had psychologically traumatized him as a child, taunting him with an enigmatic song, and leading to Sherlock [[Memory suppression|suppressing his memories]] of her. An adult Mycroft then sent her to a [[Prison#Security levels|maximum-security facility]] in the [[North Sea]], Sherrinford, and told their parents that she had died. When Mycroft insists that she is secured, a [[quadcopter]] carrying a motion-activated grenade flies into Sherlock's flat. John, Sherlock, and Mycroft flee as the bomb detonates, blasting Holmes and Watson out of the windows.\n\nLater, John and Sherlock hijack a fishing trawler to travel to Sherrinford, carrying out a diversionary plan so that Sherlock can reach Eurus' cell. Mycroft and John corner the prison governor, discovering that he has explicitly disobeyed Mycroft's protocol and has allowed Eurus to interact with prison staff. Using her skill to \"reprogram\" everyone she speaks with, Eurus has effectively taken full control of the prison. Meanwhile, Sherlock talks to Eurus, but she attacks him and knocks him unconscious. The guards lock Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and the governor together in Eurus's old cell.\n\nMycroft reveals that five years before, he granted Eurus an unsupervised interview with Moriarty as a Christmas present in exchange for detecting national security threats to Britain. During that time, Moriarty agreed to record video messages for her. After forcing the governor to commit suicide, Eurus torments Sherlock, Mycroft and Watson in a series of psychological ordeals, forcing Sherlock into sinister games to save their lives while videos of Moriarty heckle him. Although Eurus forces Sherlock onward with the prospect of saving the girl on the aeroplane, he eventually stops the games by threatening to shoot himself when she orders him to shoot either John or Mycroft. Furious, Eurus uses tranquilliser darts on the three of them.\n\nSherlock wakes up near the burnt-out wreckage of his family's old house. He speaks to the girl in the aeroplane to try to guide her in landing safely. John wakes up chained at the bottom of a well. As Eurus raises the water level in the well, John finds a human skull there, and Sherlock realizes that what he thought was his dog Redbeard was in fact his childhood friend, Victor Trevor. Eurus threw him into the well and left him for dead because she felt left out of Sherlock's attention as a child. Sherlock then deciphers the real meaning of the song that Eurus originally taunted him with when Victor went missing, which reveals that she wants him to find her. Sherlock deduces that the girl in the plane is actually Eurus's mental metaphor and that the game has been a cry for help. With Eurus' puzzle solved, Sherlock is able to send her back to Sherrinford after rescuing John.\n\nMycroft explains to his and Sherlock's parents, who are angry that they had been told that Eurus was dead, that she refuses to speak to people anymore. Sherlock visits her and they play the violin together, giving performances for their parents and Mycroft. While helping Sherlock repair his destroyed flat, John receives a video sent by Mary before she died, encouraging him to continue working with Sherlock.\n\n== Sources ==\nThe title of the episode is a reference to \"[[The Final Problem]]\" (1893).<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/sherlock/261522/sherlock-38-things-you-might-have-missed-in-the-final-problem|title=Sherlock: 38 Things You Might Have Missed in The Final Problem|author=Louisa Mellor|date=17 January 2017|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]}}</ref> The episode was partially based on \"[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]\" (1893), which it directly references.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/><ref>'Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel', Jane Stanford, Carrowmore, pps. 87,88.</ref> Watson's mention of the east wind and the name of Eurus Holmes are a reference to \"[[His Last Bow (short story)|His Last Bow]]\" (1917), where Holmes says, \"There's an east wind coming, Watson.\" The three Garrideb brothers seen in a puzzle sequence are an adaptation of \"[[The Adventure of the Three Garridebs]]\" (1924).<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> The character Victor Trevor is a reference to \"[[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott|The Adventure of the ''Gloria Scott'']]\" (1893), where he appears as Holmes' first ever close friend, albeit in university rather than in childhood.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> Jim Moriarty's brother is mentioned as a [[Radio station|broadcast station]] master, a reference to ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'' (1915), where [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]]'s brother is noted to be a [[station master|railway station master]].<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> The message on the coffin lid is a reference to \"[[The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax]]\" (1911).

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

Jackson has since founded his own film production company, [[Wingnut Films]], as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as ''The Lord of the Rings'' series.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa [[5th millennium BCE|5th]] and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless [[cattle]].<ref name=\"African Archeology Volume 1 2003\">The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.\n\nSomaliland in general is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the [[Dhambalin]] rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.<ref name=\"Hodd\">Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.</ref>\n\n===The Big commune===\n\nAccording to traditional poetic (gabay) oral accounts, Hargeisa was founded by the [[Eidagale]] clan as a watering and trading stop for passing nomads and caravans.

Round the place is a patch of jowari [Sorghum] cultivation, two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of livestock of all kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the Aleyadera nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two important caravan routes, one from Ogaden and the other from Harar. There are good direct camel-roads to Berbera and Bulhar.

Near Hargeisa are the fertile Sheikh and [[Daallo Mountain|Daallo]] mountains, which receive large amounts of [[rain]]. South of the city is the [[Haud]] savannah ([[Baligubadle]]), which attracts many different species of wildlife to graze in the area.\n\nHargeisa is situated near the town of [[Gabiley]], which serves as an agricultural centre in Somaliland. That town's Allay-Baday area produces tons of tomatoes and onions each month during the rainy season.

During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa [[5th millennium BCE|5th]] and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless [[cattle]].<ref name=\"African Archeology Volume 1 2003\">The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery.

In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.\n\nSomaliland in general is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the [[Dhambalin]] rock art.

The town of [[Arabsiyo]] is also located nearby, and is noted for its lemon production.\n\nDue to its relative fertility and greenery, wild animals come to the Hargeisa area to either breed or graze on the grassland savannah. Fauna that can be found in rural sections of the city include the [[kudu]], [[wild boar]]s, [[Somali wild ass]], [[warthog]]s, [[antelope]]s, [[Somali sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[camel]]s, and many different types of [[bird]]s. There are also a number of both public and private menageries. South of Hargeisa is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of wildlife to the area, including [[lion]]s and [[leopard]]s.\n\n== Climate ==\nHargeisa has a [[Desert climate|semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''BSh''). The city generally features warm winters and hot summers. However, despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude Hargeisa seldom experiences either very hot or very cold weather. This is a trait rarely seen in regions with a semi-arid climates. The city receives the bulk of its precipitation between the months of April and September, averaging just under {{convert|400|mm|in}} of rainfall annually. Average monthly temperatures in Hargeisa range from {{convert|18|C|0}} in the months of December and January to {{convert|24|C|0}} in the month of June.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Hargeisa\n|

He is best known for creating ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the series of [[Franco-Belgian comics#Formats|comic albums]] which are considered one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, ''[[Quick & Flupke]]'' (1930\u20131940) and ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1936\u20131957). His works were executed in his distinct ''[[ligne claire]]'' drawing style.\n\nBorn to a lower-middle-class family in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, Herg\u00e9 began his career by contributing illustrations to [[Scouting]] magazines, developing his first comic series, ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'', for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle]]'', he created ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1929 on the advice of its editor [[Norbert Wallez]]. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], the series' early installments&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', and ''[[Tintin in America]]''&nbsp;\u2014 were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Herg\u00e9 continuing the series and also developing both the ''Quick & Flupke'' and ''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' series for ''Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle''. Influenced by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], from 1934 Herg\u00e9 placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onward. Following the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in 1940, ''Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle'' was closed, but Herg\u00e9 continued his series in ''[[Le Soir]]'', a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.\n\nAfter the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, ''Le Soir'' was shut down and its staff&nbsp;\u2014 including Herg\u00e9&nbsp;\u2014 accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Herg\u00e9, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With [[Raymond Leblanc]] he established ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new ''Adventures of Tintin'' stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]' ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''. In 1950 he established [[Studios Herg\u00e9]] as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Bob de Moor]] greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an [[abstract art]]ist.\n\nHerg\u00e9's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe.{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=x}}{{Sfn|London Review of Books|2012}} He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a [[Mus\u00e9e Herg\u00e9|Herg\u00e9 Museum]] was established in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] in 2009.\n\n== Early life ==\n=== Childhood and youth: 1907\u20131925 ===\n[[File:Geburtshaus Herg\u00e9 rue Philippe-Baucq 33.jpg|thumb|200px|The house in Etterbeek where Herg\u00e9 was born]]\nGeorges Prosper Remi<ref>Opstal, H. van (1994) ''Essay RG.

Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of [[Primary education|primary schooling]] at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with [[World War I]], during which Brussels [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|was occupied by the German army]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=6|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=8}} In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in [[Ixelles]],{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=10\u201311}} but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests.{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=7}} Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 at the top of his class.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=My childhood was extremely ordinary.

During this time, he experimented with different pseudonyms, using \"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\" and \"J\u00e9r\u00e9miades\" before settling on \"Herg\u00e9\", the French pronunciation of his reversed initials (R.G.) His work was first published under this name in December 1924.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=20|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=19}}\n\n=== ''Totor'' and early career: 1925\u20131928 ===\n[[File:Totor the Boy Scout.gif|right|thumb|The ''Totor'' series was Herg\u00e9's first published comic strip.]]\nAlongside his stand-alone illustrations, in July 1926 Herg\u00e9 began production of a comic strip for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'', ''[[The Adventures of Totor|Les Aventures de Totor]]'' (''The Adventures of Totor''), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Herg\u00e9 began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including [[speech balloon]]s.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=22}} Illustrations were also published in ''Le Bl\u00e9 qui l\u00e8ve'' (''The Wheat That Grows'') and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Herg\u00e9 produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, ''The Soul of the Sea''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=15|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=17}} Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Herg\u00e9 sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived ''Atelier de la Fleur de Lys'' (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=18}}\n\nAfter graduating from secondary school in 1925, Herg\u00e9 enrolled in the \u00c9cole Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=20}} He hoped for a job as an illustrator alongside Ickx at ''[[Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle]]'' (''The Twentieth Century'')&nbsp;\u2014 a conservative \"Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information\"&nbsp;\u2014 but no positions were available.

The first, ''Tintin in the Indies'', appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, ''Mr Boullock's Disappearance'', was performed there in December.{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=109\u2013110|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=86|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=130\u2013131}} From October 1941 to May 1942, ''Le Soir'' serialised Herg\u00e9's next Tintin adventure, ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', followed by publication as a single volume by Casterman. In keeping with ''Le Soir''{{'}}s editorial standpoint, ''The Shooting Star'' espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Herg\u00e9 denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.{{Sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=106\u2013109|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2pp=48\u201351|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3pp=80\u201383|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4pp=130\u2013135}}\n\n[[File:Galerie de Traitres - Herg\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|Booklet published by the [[Belgian Resistance|resistance]] group ''L'Insoumis'', denouncing Georges Remy {{Sic}} as a collaborator.

At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Herg\u00e9 was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942.{{Sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=95|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=136\u2013137}} For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Herg\u00e9 insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that it would not be used for shading.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=137}} To cope with this additional workload, Herg\u00e9 approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, [[Edgar P.

According to McCarthy, in ''Tintin in the Congo'' Herg\u00e9 represented the Congolese as \"good at heart, but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery\".{{Sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=37}} Thompson argued that Herg\u00e9 had not written the book to be \"deliberately racist\" and that it reflected the average early 20th-century Belgian view of the Congolese, which was more patronising than malevolent.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} The book provoked no controversy at the time,{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=28}} coming to be perceived as racist only in the latter half of the 20th century.{{Sfn|Time|2010}}\n\nIn the following adventure, ''Tintin in America'', Herg\u00e9 depicted members of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] tribe of Native Americans as \"gullible, even naive\", though it was nevertheless \"broadly sympathetic\" to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States Army.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=29}} In ''The Blue Lotus'', he depicted the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed, which has also drawn accusations of racism.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=62\u201363}}\n\nHerg\u00e9 has also been accused of utilising [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] stereotypes. The character of Rastapopoulos has been claimed{{By whom|date=October 2018}} to be based on anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Herg\u00e9's protestations that the character was Greek, and not Jewish.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=42|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=64\u201365}}\n\nFrom his early years, Herg\u00e9 was openly critical of racism.

After his death in 1983, Herg\u00e9's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the [[Herg\u00e9 Foundation]] and then by the new Studios Herg\u00e9, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.{{Sfn|The Economist|2009}}\n\nThe Herg\u00e9 Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Herg\u00e9, and telling the story of his life and career which had not previously been visible to the public.{{Sfn|The Economist|2009}}{{Sfn|Time|2009}} The Museum also houses a temporary exhibition gallery.

He is best known for creating ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the series of [[Franco-Belgian comics#Formats|comic albums]] which are considered one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, ''[[Quick & Flupke]]'' (1930\u20131940) and ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1936\u20131957). His works were executed in his distinct ''[[ligne claire]]'' drawing style.\n\nBorn to a lower-middle-class family in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, Herg\u00e9 began his career by contributing illustrations to [[Scouting]] magazines, developing his first comic series, ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'', for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle]]'', he created ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1929 on the advice of its editor [[Norbert Wallez]]. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], the series' early installments&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', and ''[[Tintin in America]]''&nbsp;\u2014 were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Herg\u00e9 continuing the series and also developing both the ''Quick & Flupke'' and ''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' series for ''Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle''. Influenced by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], from 1934 Herg\u00e9 placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onward. Following the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in 1940, ''Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle'' was closed, but Herg\u00e9 continued his series in ''[[Le Soir]]'', a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.\n\nAfter the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, ''Le Soir'' was shut down and its staff&nbsp;\u2014 including Herg\u00e9&nbsp;\u2014 accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Herg\u00e9, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With [[Raymond Leblanc]] he established ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new ''Adventures of Tintin'' stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]' ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''. In 1950 he established [[Studios Herg\u00e9]] as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Bob de Moor]] greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an [[abstract art]]ist.\n\nHerg\u00e9's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe.{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=x}}{{Sfn|London Review of Books|2012}} He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a [[Mus\u00e9e Herg\u00e9|Herg\u00e9 Museum]] was established in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] in 2009.\n\n== Early life ==\n=== Childhood and youth: 1907\u20131925 ===\n[[File:Geburtshaus Herg\u00e9 rue Philippe-Baucq 33.jpg|thumb|200px|The house in Etterbeek where Herg\u00e9 was born]]\nGeorges Prosper Remi<ref>Opstal, H. van (1994) ''Essay RG.

Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of [[Primary education|primary schooling]] at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with [[World War I]], during which Brussels [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|was occupied by the German army]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=6|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=8}} In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in [[Ixelles]],{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=10\u201311}} but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests.{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=7}} Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 at the top of his class.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=My childhood was extremely ordinary.

According to McCarthy, in ''Tintin in the Congo'' Herg\u00e9 represented the Congolese as \"good at heart, but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery\".{{Sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=37}} Thompson argued that Herg\u00e9 had not written the book to be \"deliberately racist\" and that it reflected the average early 20th-century Belgian view of the Congolese, which was more patronising than malevolent.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} The book provoked no controversy at the time,{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=28}} coming to be perceived as racist only in the latter half of the 20th century.{{Sfn|Time|2010}}\n\nIn the following adventure, ''Tintin in America'', Herg\u00e9 depicted members of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] tribe of Native Americans as \"gullible, even naive\", though it was nevertheless \"broadly sympathetic\" to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States Army.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=29}} In ''The Blue Lotus'', he depicted the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed, which has also drawn accusations of racism.{{Sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=62\u201363}}\n\nHerg\u00e9 has also been accused of utilising [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] stereotypes. The character of Rastapopoulos has been claimed{{By whom|date=October 2018}} to be based on anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Herg\u00e9's protestations that the character was Greek, and not Jewish.{{Sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=42|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=64\u201365}}\n\nFrom his early years, Herg\u00e9 was openly critical of racism.

There has historically been a tension in the understanding of the medical narratives: are they of the same nature as Muhammad\u2019s religious pronouncements, or are they time-sensitive, culturally situated, and thus not representative of a set of eternal medical truths? <ref name = \"Ragab\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ragab | first1 = Ahmed | year = 2012 | title = Prophetic Traditions and Modern Medicine in the Middle East: Resurrection, Reinterpretation, and Reconstruction| doi = 10.7817/jameroriesoci.132.4.0657 | journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 657\u2013673 }}</ref> This body of knowledge was fully articulated only in the 14th century, at which point it was concerned with reconciling ''[[Sunnah]]'' (traditions) with the foundations of the [[Galen]]ic [[Humorism|humoral theory]] that was prevalent at the time in the medical institutions of the [[wiktionary:Islamicate|Islamicate]] world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Justin|title=Writing the History of the Natural Sciences in the Pre-modern Muslim World: Historiography, Religion, and the Importance of the Early Modern Period|journal=History Compass|date=1 December 2011 | volume=9 | issue=12 | pages=923\u2013951 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00810.x}}</ref> It is nonetheless a tradition with  continued modern-day currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tibbenabawi.org/ |title=:: Tibb-e-Nabawi, Healing by ISLAM |website=Tibbenabawi.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prophetic-medicine.com/ |title=Lifestyle & Wellbeing According to the Quran & Sunna |publisher=Prophetic Medicine |date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nProphetic medicine is sometimes casually identified with ''[[Unani]]'' medicine or [[traditional medicine]], although it is distinguished from some iterations of these and from [[scientific medicine]] most predominantly by the former being specifically a collection of advice attributed to Muhammad in the Islamic tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Franz|title=The classical heritage in Islam|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-01997-0|author2=Marmorstein, Jenny |page=182}}</ref> One would do well to note that medieval interpretations of the medical hadith were produced in a Galenic medical context, while modern-day editions might bring in recent research findings to frame the importance of the genre. In the hadith, Muhammad recommended the use of [[honey]] and ''[[hijama]]'' ([[Cupping therapy#Wet cupping (Al-Hijamah or medicinal bleeding)|wet cupping]]) for healing and had generally opposed the use of [[cauterization]] for causing \"pain and menace to a patient\".<ref name=Deuraseh>{{cite journal | author = Deuraseh Nurdeen | title = Ahadith of the Prophet on Healing in Three Things (al-Shifa' fi Thalatha): An Interpretational | url = | journal = Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine | volume = 2003 | issue = 4| pages = 14\u201320 }}</ref> Other items with beneficial effects attributed to Muhammad, and standard features on traditional medicine in the Islamicate world, include olive oil; dates; ''[[miswak]]'' as a necessity for oral health and [[Nigella sativa]] or \"black seed\" or \"black cumin\" and its oils.

The most notable works that still survive<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamic-arts.org/2012/the-magic-of-science/ |title=The Magic of Science |website=Islamic-arts.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> are attributed to religious scholars and largely not to Galenic physicians, although the latter are occasionally referenced.\n\n[[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] in the 1300s produced one of the most influential works about prophetic medicine in his 277-chapter book, ''Al-Tibb al-Nabawiyy''. Al-Jawziyya deals with a diversity of treatments as recommended by Muhammad but also engages with ethical concerns, discussing malpractice and the hallmarks of the competent doctor.<ref name=\"elgood\">[[Cyril Elgood]] (1962) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1034700/ The Medicine Of the Prophet].

Along with Al-Jawziyya, Al-Suyuti also included commentary that spoke to dealing with contagion and thus was relevant to the [[Black Death]] in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. [[Ibn al-Khatib]] also addressed the Black Death and his belief in the contradiction between hadith and science regarding plagues, which may have led to his execution by [[strangulation]] for \"heresy\".<ref name=kadri>{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law#v=onepage&q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&f=false}}</ref>\n\nBoth of the works above also address [[Bioethics|bioethical]] issues of [[Islam and abortion|abortion]] and conception, issues that, like the idea of Islamic medical heritage as being [[Holism|holistic]], continue to be important in constructions of modern Islamic identity.<ref>[[Fazlur Rahman]] Health and Medicine in the Islamic Tradition: Change and Identity.
