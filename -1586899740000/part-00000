Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses.

Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

During this time, whenever the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] won provincially, the entire eastern half of the island was coated light blue. Federally, it was the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'s power base from 1993 to 2011, partly due to its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] bent. With the exception of ethnic areas that protrude from Northern Montreal into the East Island's Honor\u00e9-Mercier riding, where [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] support is strong, the area is relatively homogeneously Francophone and lower-income, a recipe for Bloc dominance. Prior to the rise of the Bloc, the region voted solidly Liberal for decades before being swept up in the [[Brian Mulroney]] tide, electing Quebec nationalists under the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] banner.  The [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has never approached this level of support, and eastern Montreal is currently the weakest region in Canada for the Tories. In 2011, the federalist [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] swept every seat in this region amid the surge of popular support in the province and the concurrent Bloc meltdown, in all but one case by well over 6,000 votes.  The NDP surge even cost longtime Bloc leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] his seat in [[Laurier-Sainte-Marie]].\n\nThe NDP largely held its gains in 2015, losing Honor\u00e9-Mercier to the Liberals and [[La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele]]\u2014long reckoned as the most strongly sovereigntist riding in Quebec\u2014to the Bloc.  However, Duceppe came up well short in his bid to retake his old riding. In 2019, however, the NDP was cut down to just one riding in eastern Montreal, with the Bloc holding onto La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele and the Liberals taking the other three.\n\n{|

During this time, whenever the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] won provincially, the entire eastern half of the island was coated light blue. Federally, it was the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'s power base from 1993 to 2011, partly due to its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] bent. With the exception of ethnic areas that protrude from Northern Montreal into the East Island's Honor\u00e9-Mercier riding, where [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] support is strong, the area is relatively homogeneously Francophone and lower-income, a recipe for Bloc dominance. Prior to the rise of the Bloc, the region voted solidly Liberal for decades before being swept up in the [[Brian Mulroney]] tide, electing Quebec nationalists under the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] banner.  The [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has never approached this level of support, and eastern Montreal is currently the weakest region in Canada for the Tories. In 2011, the federalist [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] swept every seat in this region amid the surge of popular support in the province and the concurrent Bloc meltdown, in all but one case by well over 6,000 votes.  The NDP surge even cost longtime Bloc leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] his seat in [[Laurier-Sainte-Marie]].\n\nThe NDP largely held its gains in 2015, losing Honor\u00e9-Mercier to the Liberals and [[La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele]]\u2014long reckoned as the most strongly sovereigntist riding in Quebec\u2014to the Bloc.  However, Duceppe came up well short in his bid to retake his old riding. In 2019, however, the NDP was cut down to just one riding in eastern Montreal, with the Bloc holding onto La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele and the Liberals taking the other three.\n\n{|

During those trips Ole's sensibility experienced a new type of light, powerful natural forms, contrasts of colour and structure, of rocks and water found on [[fjord]]s. In fact, his next creative period is entirely centered in North Scandinavian landscape.<ref>{{cite book | title=Eduard Ole: The Life and Work of the Artist| last=M\u00e4gi | first=Arvo | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | publisher=Estniska Kultursamfundet | location=Stockholm | isbn=91-7260-197-3 | page=21}}</ref> Ole left his earlier calm and transcending planes of restrained colours to scintillating, vibrating, and dramatic compositions. [[Post-Impressionism|Post-impressionist]] [[Pointillism]] became strong although never dominant.\n\nOle's style evolution can be clearly noticed in his 1948 paintings [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100333/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5425 Motiiv Stockholmi saarestikust I] ({{lang-en|Motif from the [[Stockholm Archipelago]] I}}), [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100352/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5426 Motiiv Stockholmi saarestikust II] ({{lang-en|Motif from the Stockholm Archipelago II}}), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100436/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5427 Kodusadamasse saabumine] ({{lang-en|Arrival at the Home Port}}). Further evolution with loss of clear contours and increasing vibrant colours is clear in the 1952 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100453/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5429 Teekond Jotunheimi m\u00e4gedesse] ({{lang-en|A Journey to the [[Jotunheimen]] Mountains}}) and 1966 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100501/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5430 Maastik Lofootidelt] ({{lang-en|[[Lofoten]] Landscape}}). Such works, particularly their expressionist dynamism of colour, have a definite influence of other Nordic artists, such as [[Edvard Munch]], [[Ernst Josephson]], and [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Eduard Ole: The Life and Work of the Artist| last=M\u00e4gi | first=Arvo | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | publisher=Estniska Kultursamfundet | location=Stockholm | isbn=91-7260-197-3 | page=24}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s Ole's style underwent a new and unexpected metamorphosis, returning to a cubist simplification of forms and gentle planes and motives, moving from landscape painting towards figurative compositions. These figures, almost naturalistic but simplified in a classical manner, attain a synthesis of Cubism-Na\u00efvism. The result of this last change can be noticed on Ole's self-portrait of 1979 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100537/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5431 Autoportree], on the 1988 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100555/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5432 Motiiv Stockholmist] ({{lang-en|Motif from Stockholm}}), and on the 1991 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009100639/http://www.digikogu.ekm.ee/eesti19saj_1940/oid-5433 Uue pesa ehitamine.

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nAccording to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nThe base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.\n\nIts secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component\u2014the so-called [[S-box]]es\u2014had been altered to insert a \"[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]\" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against [[differential cryptanalysis]], a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the IBM DES team.\n\n=== Advanced Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}\nThe involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), was limited to hardware performance testing (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES competition]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hardware Performance Simulations of Round 2 Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithms|author=Weeks, Bryan|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=June 29, 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024234406/http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA-approved systems.<ref name=\"suiteB\">\"the NIST standards that define Suite B...\" in {{cite web|title=Suite B Cryptography / Cryptographic Interoperability|url=https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=June 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101091229/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== NSA encryption systems ===\n[[File:STU-IIIphones.nsa.jpg|thumb|[[STU-III]] secure telephones on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]]]]\n{{Main|NSA encryption systems}}\n\nThe NSA is responsible for the encryption-related components in these legacy systems:\n* [[FNBDT]] Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal<ref>{{cite book|title=C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups|author=Committee on C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups, National Research Council|isbn=978-0-309-09600-3|publisher=National Academies Press |year=2006|page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NByKhCK3edkC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167}}</ref>\n* [[KL-7]] ADONIS off-line rotor encryption machine (post-WWII \u2013 1980s)<ref>\"Adkins Family asked for a pic of the KL-7.

Bush]], the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining [[warrant (law)|warrants]] from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a secret court created for that purpose under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA).<ref name=\"NYTWarrantless\">[[James Risen]] & [[Eric Lichtblau]] (December 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nOne such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion.

In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]], although the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ''[[ACLU v.

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nAccording to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nThe base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.\n\nIts secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component\u2014the so-called [[S-box]]es\u2014had been altered to insert a \"[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]\" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against [[differential cryptanalysis]], a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the IBM DES team.\n\n=== Advanced Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}\nThe involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), was limited to hardware performance testing (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES competition]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hardware Performance Simulations of Round 2 Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithms|author=Weeks, Bryan|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=June 29, 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024234406/http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA-approved systems.<ref name=\"suiteB\">\"the NIST standards that define Suite B...\" in {{cite web|title=Suite B Cryptography / Cryptographic Interoperability|url=https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=June 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101091229/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== NSA encryption systems ===\n[[File:STU-IIIphones.nsa.jpg|thumb|[[STU-III]] secure telephones on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]]]]\n{{Main|NSA encryption systems}}\n\nThe NSA is responsible for the encryption-related components in these legacy systems:\n* [[FNBDT]] Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal<ref>{{cite book|title=C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups|author=Committee on C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups, National Research Council|isbn=978-0-309-09600-3|publisher=National Academies Press |year=2006|page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NByKhCK3edkC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167}}</ref>\n* [[KL-7]] ADONIS off-line rotor encryption machine (post-WWII \u2013 1980s)<ref>\"Adkins Family asked for a pic of the KL-7.

Bush]], the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining [[warrant (law)|warrants]] from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a secret court created for that purpose under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA).<ref name=\"NYTWarrantless\">[[James Risen]] & [[Eric Lichtblau]] (December 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nOne such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion.

In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]], although the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ''[[ACLU v.
