The series stars [[Philip Madoc]] as protagonist DCI Noel Bain. Four series were broadcast between 1994 and 2002; and first aired as ''Yr Heliwr'' on [[S4C]], before being broadcast on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the UK. \n\nThe series was filmed in both English and in Welsh, with each scene being shot first in one language and then in the other.<ref>Eclipse Magazine - http://eclipsemagazine.com/dvd/15098/</ref> The series has since been dubbed into more than a dozen languages and shown all over the world. The series is set in [[South Wales]], and features a variety of post-industrial, rural, urban and seaside landscapes. The pilot episode was filmed in the [[Aberystwyth]] area. All twenty-two episodes are available on DVD.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Philip Madoc]] plays Detective Chief Inspector Noel Bain, a man who looks back fondly to the days when policing involved chasing villains, playing rugby and drinking beer. However, he has come to realise that contemporary policing imposes dilemmas that no training manual could ever anticipate. He is a man out of time and seeks to protect the old way of life, and what he believes are important traditional values. Bain is a widower who has a tempestuous relationship with his daughter, Hannah. \n\nDespite resenting the lack of time her father spent with the family because of police work, Hannah becomes a WPC on the same police force. Bain often sees his position as not just a job; but his [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]]; meaning that his journey is often an emotional and painful one as the personal and professional universes collide. Bain has a close friendship with police pathologist Professor Margaret Edwards ([[Sharon Morgan]]), but his true feelings for her remain ambiguous. \n\nOther regular characters include Gillian Elisa Thomas and Geraint Lewis. Joining the regulars in the last series were [[Bryn F\u00f4n]], [[Ieuan Rhys]], Huw Llyr and Elen Bowman.
