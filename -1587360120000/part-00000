It supplies electricity to approximately 24,300 customers in the city of [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], the townships of [[South Glengarry, Ontario|South Glengarry]] and [[South Stormont|South Stormont,]] and a portion of the [[Mohawk Nation]] territory of [[Akwesasne]] in Eastern Ontario.  The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].  Cornwall Electric is the only electricity distributor in the province of [[Ontario]] that obtains its electricity from the province of [[Quebec]].  That makes it exempt from the OEB's rate regulations,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkingpower.ca/PDFs/FeaturedNews/Report%20of%20the%20Ontario%20Distribution%20Sector%20Review%20Panel.pdf|title=Report of the Ontario Distribution Sector Review Panel|last=|first=|date=December 2012|website=Thinking Power|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  and with its negotiated long-term contracts, provides electricity consumers with some of the lowest rates in Ontario.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanairalliance.org/cornbul/|title=Why do people in Cornwall have lower electricity bills than you? {{!}} Ontario Clean Air Alliance|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oeb.ca/_html/performance/rates_chart_2016.php?class=Res|title=Electricity Distributor Performance - Rates Comparison - Estimated Total Bills for Ontario Distributors|website=www.oeb.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nThe Cornwall Electric distribution system is powered by a 72-kilometre (44.74 mi) double-circuit 120-kilovolt, 325-megawatt  interconnection line.  It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.

Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.

First of all, between 2003 and 2012, one fifth of the permanent migrants into Sweden were considered humanitarian migrants. This is a higher percentage than all other OECD countries and likely plays a role in the employment gaps as humanitarian migrants typically find it more difficult to integrate into OECD countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Finding the Way: A discussion of the Swedish Migrant Integration System|url=https://www.oecd.org/migration/swedish-migrant-intergation-system.pdf|website=OECD|accessdate=30 January 2019|date=July 2014}}</ref> Second of all, less than 5% of jobs in Sweden require only a high school degree.<ref name=\"Bloomberg\"/> With migrants from Syria and Iraq almost certainly having never studied Swedish back home, it is inevitably difficult for them to find work.

Larsson at the ''Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum'' shows that a majority of the foreign-born in Sweden during the period 1990 to 2016 have not become self-sufficient with respect to earnings. The results differ from the official statistics, which do not differentiate between part-time and full-time employment. Individuals of working age, 20-64 years, who achieve half of the median income were included, as this is defined as the lower limit for self-sufficiency. According to this study, the self-sufficiency of domestic-born Swedes was 73 percent in 2016, whereas the corresponding proportion for individuals born in Africa was 38 percent, and 36 percent for those born in the Middle East. The report pointed out that this measurement method still overestimates the degree of self-sufficiency of migrants, since it does not exclude jobs that are tax-financed through labor market initiatives which thus constitute a form of social security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entreprenorskapsforum.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rapport_Sjalvforsorjning_web.pdf|last1=Eklund|first1=Johan|last2=P.

According to this study, the self-sufficiency of domestic-born Swedes was 73 percent in 2016, whereas the corresponding proportion for individuals born in Africa was 38 percent, and 36 percent for those born in the Middle East. The report pointed out that this measurement method still overestimates the degree of self-sufficiency of migrants, since it does not exclude jobs that are tax-financed through labor market initiatives which thus constitute a form of social security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entreprenorskapsforum.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rapport_Sjalvforsorjning_web.pdf|last1=Eklund|first1=Johan|last2=P.
