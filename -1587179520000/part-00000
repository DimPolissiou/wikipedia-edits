In [[polytheistic]] religions, gods are more likely to have literal [[sex]]es which would enable them to interact with each other, and even with humans, in a sexual way.\n\nIn most [[monotheistic]] religions, one cannot apply a [[gender]] to [[God]] in the usual sense, as God's attributes cannot be compared to those of any other being. Thus, the idea of a \"divine gender\" is ultimately considered an [[analogy]], used by humans in order to better relate to the [[concept of God]], with no sexual connotation.\n\nGod is an intangible spirit in most religions and is therefore thought to have no gender. The preponderance of references to God in both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments are in the context of a masculine reference, often \"Father\". However, there are a significant number of feminine allegorical references to God, most often in some maternal role.\n\n== Abrahamic religions ==\n\n=== In the Hebrew and Christian Bible ===\nGod is usually figuratively imagined in [[God (male deity)|male terms]] in Biblical sources,<ref name=pagels/> with [[Goddess|female analogy]] in {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:26-27|KJV}},<ref name=pagels>[[Elaine Pagels|Elaine H.

Although in the Talmudic part of the Torah and especially in Kabalah G-d is referred to under the name '[[Shekhinah|Sh'chinah]]' - which is feminine, this is only to accentuate the fact that all the creation and nature are actually in the receiving end in reference to the creator and as no part of the creation can perceive the Creator outside of nature, it is adequate to refer to the divine presence in feminine form. We refer to G-d using masculine terms simply for convenience's sake, because Hebrew has no neutral gender; G-d is no more male than a table is.\" [http://www.jewfaq.org/g-d.htm Judaism 101]. \"The fact that we always refer to God as 'He' is also not meant to imply that the concept of sex or gender applies to God.\" Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, ''The Aryeh Kaplan Reader'', Mesorah Publications (1983), p. 144</ref> At times, Jewish [[aggadah|aggadic literature]] and [[Jewish mysticism]] do treat God as gendered.

All major English Bible translations have retained the masculine pronoun for the Spirit, as in John 16:13. Although it has been noted that in the original Greek, in some parts of John's Gospel, the neuter Greek word for \"it\" is also used for the Spirit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|God in Islam}}\nThe oneness of God is of primary importance in the [[Quran]] and Islam. In Qur'an, Allah is most often referred to with the pronouns ''Hu'' or ''Huwa'', and although these are commonly translated as ''him'', they can also be translated gender-neutrally, as ''them''. This is also true of the feminine equivalent, ''Hiya''. Qur'an 112:3\u20134 states: \"He begets not, nor is He begotten. And none is like Him [Them].\"\nOther references include the first person pronoun, and the [[relative pronoun]] ''ma'' (''that which''), as in the phrase \"the heavens and that which created them\" (Qur'an 91:5).\n\n== Indian religions ==\n{{See also|Indian religions}}\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|God and gender in Hinduism}}\nIn [[Hinduism]], there are diverse approaches to conceptualizing God and gender. Many Hindus focus upon impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] ([[Brahman]]) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as [[Androgyny|androgynous]] (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender [[henotheism]], that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.<ref>John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, {{ISBN|978-0809138456}}, pages 74-76</ref><ref>{{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|What is Hinduism?|page=PR17}}, Hinduism Today, Hawaii</ref>\n\nThe [[Shakti]] tradition conceives of God as a female. Other [[Bhakti]] traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a [[devi]].<ref name=\"adishakti.org\">[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]</ref>\n\nThe oldest of the Hindu scriptures is the [[Rigveda]] (2nd millennium BC). The first word of the Rigveda is the name [[Agni]], the god of fire, to whom many of the vedic hymns are addressed, along with [[Indra]] the warrior. Agni and Indra are both male divinities.\n\nThe Rigveda refers to a creator ([[Hiranyagarbha]] or [[Prajapati]]), distinct from Agni and Indra. This creator is identified with [[Brahma]] (not to be confused with [[Brahman]], the first cause), born of Vishnu's navel, in later scriptures. Hiranyagarbha and Prajapati are male divinities, as is Brahma (who has a female consort, [[Saraswati]]).\n[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rigveda]]\nThere are many other gods in the Rigveda.<ref name=\"Witzel\">\n[[Michael Witzel]], '[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/EJVS-7-3.pdf Autochthonous Aryans?] The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts', ''[[Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies]]'' '''7''' (2001): 1\u2013118.</ref>\nThey are \"not simple forces of nature\", and possess \"complex character and their own mythology\".<ref name=Witzel />\nThey include goddesses of water (\u0100pa\u1e25) and dawn (U\u1e63as), and the complementary pairing of Father Heaven and Mother Earth.<ref name=Witzel />\nHowever, they are all \"subservient to the abstract, but active positive 'force of truth'\" ([[Rta]]),\n\"which pervades the universe and all actions of the gods and humans.\"<ref name=Witzel />\nThis force is sometimes mediated or represented by moral gods ([[Aditya|\u0100ditya]] such as [[Varuna|Varu\u1e47a]]) or even Indra.<ref name=Witzel />\nThe \u0100ditya are male and Rta is personified as masculine in later scriptures (see also [[Dharma]]).\n\nIn some Hindu philosophical traditions, [[God]] is depersonalized as the quality-less [[Nirguna Brahman]], the fundamental life force of the universe. However, theism itself is central to Hinduism.<ref>\n\"Religious theism which is central to Hinduism.\" Robert Lawson Slater, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1385227 Review] of Philip H. Ashby ''History and Future of Religious Thought: Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam''. ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' '''4''' (1964): 117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nWhile many Hindus focus upon God in the neutral form,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Brahman]] being of neuter gender grammatically, there are prominent Hindu traditions that conceive God as female, even as the source of the male form of God, such as the [[Shakta]] denomination. Hinduism, especially of the [[Samkhya]] school, views the creation of the cosmos as the result of the play of two radically distinct principles: the feminine matter ([[Prakriti]]) and the masculine spirit ([[Purusha]]). Prakriti is the primordial matter which is present before the cosmos becomes manifest. Prakriti is seen as being \"the power of nature, both animate and inanimate. As such, nature is seen as dynamic energy\" (Rae, 1994). Prakriti is originally passive, immobile and pure potentiality by nature . Only through her contact with the kinetic Purusha she unfolds into the diverse forms before us. The idea of Prakriti/Purusha leads to the concept of the Divine Consort. Almost every [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon has a feminine consort ([[devi]]).<ref name=\"adishakti.org\"/>\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Gender of God in Sikhism}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nThe [[Guru Granth]] consistently refers to God as \"He\" and \"Father\". However, it also says that God is indescribable. Thus, God in Sikhism has no gender. The [[Akal Purakh]] (\"Timeless Being\") is referred to as one of the gender, simply because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages ([[Sant Bhasha|mixture]] of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender.\n\nIt is described as energy that prevails throughout the universe.\n\n== Animist religions ==\nAnimist religions are common among oral societies, many of which still exist in the 21st century. Typically, natural forces and [[shaman]] spiritual guides feature in these religions, rather than fully fledged personal divinities with established personalities. It is in polytheism that such deities are found. Animist religions often, but not always, attribute gender to spirits considered to permeate the world and its events. Polytheistic religions, however, almost always attribute gender to their gods, though a few notable divinities are associated with various forms of [[epicene]] characteristics\u2014gods that manifest alternatingly as male and female, gods with one male and one female \"face\", and gods whose most distinctive characteristic is their unknown gender.<ref>\n\"We are yet more strongly reminded by the two-fold nature of Phanes of the epicene god-heads, who occur frequently in the Babylonian pantheon.\"\nGauranga Nath Banerjee, ''Hellenism in Ancient India'', (Read Books, 2007), p. 304.</ref>\n\n== Other ==\n[[Carol P.

In [[polytheistic]] religions, gods are more likely to have literal [[sex]]es which would enable them to interact with each other, and even with humans, in a sexual way.\n\nIn most [[monotheistic]] religions, one cannot apply a [[gender]] to [[God]] in the usual sense, as God's attributes cannot be compared to those of any other being. Thus, the idea of a \"divine gender\" is ultimately considered an [[analogy]], used by humans in order to better relate to the [[concept of God]], with no sexual connotation.\n\nGod is an intangible spirit in most religions and is therefore thought to have no gender. The preponderance of references to God in both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments are in the context of a masculine reference, often \"Father\".

All major English Bible translations have retained the masculine pronoun for the Spirit, as in John 16:13. Although it has been noted that in the original Greek, in some parts of John's Gospel, the neuter Greek word for \"it\" is also used for the Spirit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|God in Islam}}\nThe oneness of God is of primary importance in the [[Quran]] and Islam. In Qur'an, Allah is most often referred to with the pronouns ''Hu'' or ''Huwa'', and although these are commonly translated as ''him'', they can also be translated gender-neutrally, as ''them''. This is also true of the feminine equivalent, ''Hiya''. Qur'an 112:3\u20134 states: \"He begets not, nor is He begotten. And none is like Him [Them].\"\nOther references include the first person pronoun, and the [[relative pronoun]] ''ma'' (''that which''), as in the phrase \"the heavens and that which created them\" (Qur'an 91:5).\n\n== Indian religions ==\n{{See also|Indian religions}}\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|God and gender in Hinduism}}\nIn [[Hinduism]], there are diverse approaches to conceptualizing God and gender. Many Hindus focus upon impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] ([[Brahman]]) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as [[Androgyny|androgynous]] (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender [[henotheism]], that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.<ref>John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, {{ISBN|978-0809138456}}, pages 74-76</ref><ref>{{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|What is Hinduism?|page=PR17}}, Hinduism Today, Hawaii</ref>\n\nThe [[Shakti]] tradition conceives of God as a female. Other [[Bhakti]] traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a [[devi]].<ref name=\"adishakti.org\">[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]</ref>\n\nThe oldest of the Hindu scriptures is the [[Rigveda]] (2nd millennium BC). The first word of the Rigveda is the name [[Agni]], the god of fire, to whom many of the vedic hymns are addressed, along with [[Indra]] the warrior. Agni and Indra are both male divinities.\n\nThe Rigveda refers to a creator ([[Hiranyagarbha]] or [[Prajapati]]), distinct from Agni and Indra. This creator is identified with [[Brahma]] (not to be confused with [[Brahman]], the first cause), born of Vishnu's navel, in later scriptures. Hiranyagarbha and Prajapati are male divinities, as is Brahma (who has a female consort, [[Saraswati]]).\n[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rigveda]]\nThere are many other gods in the Rigveda.<ref name=\"Witzel\">\n[[Michael Witzel]], '[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/EJVS-7-3.pdf Autochthonous Aryans?] The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts', ''[[Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies]]'' '''7''' (2001): 1\u2013118.</ref>\nThey are \"not simple forces of nature\", and possess \"complex character and their own mythology\".<ref name=Witzel />\nThey include goddesses of water (\u0100pa\u1e25) and dawn (U\u1e63as), and the complementary pairing of Father Heaven and Mother Earth.<ref name=Witzel />\nHowever, they are all \"subservient to the abstract, but active positive 'force of truth'\" ([[Rta]]),\n\"which pervades the universe and all actions of the gods and humans.\"<ref name=Witzel />\nThis force is sometimes mediated or represented by moral gods ([[Aditya|\u0100ditya]] such as [[Varuna|Varu\u1e47a]]) or even Indra.<ref name=Witzel />\nThe \u0100ditya are male and Rta is personified as masculine in later scriptures (see also [[Dharma]]).\n\nIn some Hindu philosophical traditions, [[God]] is depersonalized as the quality-less [[Nirguna Brahman]], the fundamental life force of the universe. However, theism itself is central to Hinduism.<ref>\n\"Religious theism which is central to Hinduism.\" Robert Lawson Slater, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1385227 Review] of Philip H. Ashby ''History and Future of Religious Thought: Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam''. ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' '''4''' (1964): 117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nWhile many Hindus focus upon God in the neutral form,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Brahman]] being of neuter gender grammatically, there are prominent Hindu traditions that conceive God as female, even as the source of the male form of God, such as the [[Shakta]] denomination. Hinduism, especially of the [[Samkhya]] school, views the creation of the cosmos as the result of the play of two radically distinct principles: the feminine matter ([[Prakriti]]) and the masculine spirit ([[Purusha]]). Prakriti is the primordial matter which is present before the cosmos becomes manifest. Prakriti is seen as being \"the power of nature, both animate and inanimate. As such, nature is seen as dynamic energy\" (Rae, 1994). Prakriti is originally passive, immobile and pure potentiality by nature . Only through her contact with the kinetic Purusha she unfolds into the diverse forms before us. The idea of Prakriti/Purusha leads to the concept of the Divine Consort. Almost every [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon has a feminine consort ([[devi]]).<ref name=\"adishakti.org\"/>\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Gender of God in Sikhism}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nThe [[Guru Granth]] consistently refers to God as \"He\" and \"Father\". However, it also says that God is indescribable. Thus, God in Sikhism has no gender. The [[Akal Purakh]] (\"Timeless Being\") is referred to as one of the gender, simply because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages ([[Sant Bhasha|mixture]] of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender.\n\nIt is described as energy that prevails throughout the universe.\n\n== Animist religions ==\nAnimist religions are common among oral societies, many of which still exist in the 21st century. Typically, natural forces and [[shaman]] spiritual guides feature in these religions, rather than fully fledged personal divinities with established personalities. It is in polytheism that such deities are found. Animist religions often, but not always, attribute gender to spirits considered to permeate the world and its events. Polytheistic religions, however, almost always attribute gender to their gods, though a few notable divinities are associated with various forms of [[epicene]] characteristics\u2014gods that manifest alternatingly as male and female, gods with one male and one female \"face\", and gods whose most distinctive characteristic is their unknown gender.<ref>\n\"We are yet more strongly reminded by the two-fold nature of Phanes of the epicene god-heads, who occur frequently in the Babylonian pantheon.\"\nGauranga Nath Banerjee, ''Hellenism in Ancient India'', (Read Books, 2007), p. 304.</ref>\n\n== Other ==\n[[Carol P.

Nammalvar''' (Tamil : \u0b95\u0bcb. \u0ba8\u0bae\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd, 6 April 1938 \u2013 30 December 2013) was an [[India]]n green crusader, agricultural scientist, environmental activist and [[organic farming]] expert best known for his work on spreading [[ecological farming]] and [[organic farming]]. He led the protest against the methane gas project started by [[Great Eastern Energy]] Corporation proposed in the [[Cauvery]] delta region of [[Tamilnadu]]. Nammalvar was the author of several [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]] books on natural farming, natural pesticides & natural fertilizers and was featured in magazines & television programs.\nHe reinstated so called pesticides is actually Biocide, literally it kills all organism from micro to macro, which is anti pattern to agricultural ecology.\nHe also trashed government and agriculture department as semi-literate by introducing salt as fertilizer, which again kills agriculture ecology.\nHe stressed the importance of cow and cattle in agriculture ecology to achieve freedom in agriculture.\n\n==Life==\n\nNammalvar was born in 1938 in the village of [[Elangadu]] in [[Thanjavur district|Thanjavur District, Tamilnadu]]. He graduated from [[Annamalai University]] with a BSc degree in Agriculture. In 1963, he began working for the Agricultural Regional Research Station, a government organisation in Kovilpatti, as a scientist, conducting trials on spacing and manure levels of various chemical [[fertilizer]]s in cotton and [[millet]] crops. During his tenure there, the government had conducted various experiments in rain fed land, using expensive inputs like hybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides which Nammalvar considered futile as the rain fed farmers were resource poor. Based on his experience, he felt very strongly that it was imperative to totally reorient the research work being undertaken. But his peers at the institute paid little attention to his advice. Frustrated, he left the institute.\n\nFor the next 10 years, he was an agronomist for [[Islands of Peace]], an organisation founded by the Nobel Laureate [[Dominique Pire]]. His focus was on improving the standard of living through agricultural development in the Kalakad block of [[Tirunelveli]] District, Tamil Nadu. It was at this time that he realized that in order to get optimal results in farming, farmers should rely only minimally on external inputs. All inputs should come from within the farm. So-called wastes should be recycled and used as input. This revelation was a turning point in his life. He completely lost trust in conventional farming practices and began experimenting with sustainable agricultural methods.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Nammalvar became greatly influenced by Paulo Freire and Vinoba Bhave and their theories on education. The purpose of education should be freedom. Freedom is essentially self-reliance. Self-sufficiency means that one should not depend on others for one\u2019s daily bread. Secondly, one should have developed the power to acquire knowledge for oneself. And last but not the least, a man should be able to rule himself, to control his thoughts and feelings.\n\nEager to propagate these new theories on education, specifically to aid farmers in becoming self-sufficient, he started a Society, Kudumbam in 1979<ref name=\"Kudumbam\">{{cite web|url=http://kudumbam.in/about%20us.html |title=Kudumbam-About Us |}}</ref>.\n\n\"Participatory Development\" was the way forward. There can be no education without action. Nor can there be any action without education. Both go hand in hand. Nammalvar interacted with local farmers, understood their needs, and based on their input, evolved farming practices suited to the local farmers.<ref>{{cite news|title=G Nammalvar, messiah of organic revolution|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/g-nammalvar-messiah-of-organic-revolution-43246|accessdate=26 February 2018|publisher=Down To Earth|date=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987 G.Nammalvar attended a 4-week training course conducted by the ETC Foundation, Netherlands, on ecological agriculture. In 1990, he founded a network called LEISA (Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture) to promote the concepts of ecological farming, specifically the importance of self-reliability and low external inputs. During the same year, he started an ecological research center for rain-fed cultivation in Pudukottai district.\n\nG.Nammalvar was also greatly influenced by Mr Bernard de-Clerk of Auroville fame, whom he had worked with since 1984. In 1995 he was nominated as the Tamil Nadu state coordinator for ARISE (Agricultural Renewal in India for Sustainable Environment). Concurrently, Bernard was the coordinator at the national level. During his tenure he traveled widely across India promoting the principles of sustainable agriculture.\n\nWhen the tsunami hit India on 26 December 2004, Nammalvar was actively involved in the rehabilitation process. In 2005, he helped farmers across various villages in Nagapattinam district to rehabilitate. Few villages he worked were Mangaimadam, Periya Kuthagai, Therku Pothigai Nallur. In 2006, he left for Indonesia and assisted in reclaiming several farms in tsunami-affected areas.\n\nRecognizing his extensive work in the field of agriculture, the Gandhi Gram Rural University, [[Dindigul|Dindigal]] honored Nammalvar with a Doctorate of Science degree in 2007.\n\nG.Nammalvar traveled widely across the world, observed the agricultural practices in various different ecological systems and based on his findings, trained several farmers and NGO workers. He has written several books and articles in the Tamil language. He had a wide readership across different sections of society. His works may soon be translated to the English language, making his writings easily accessible.\n\nG.Nammalvar spent a substantial part of his time actively touring the south and conducting training classes on ecological farming. He was in the process of setting up several research cum training centers across South India. The first was at Surumanpatti, Kadavur in Karur district. He was also actively involved in linking different farms and institutes around the world so as to accelerate the process of ecological development.<ref>http://www.vikatan.com/new/article.php?module=magazine&aid=34779</ref>\n\nHe led the Historic Protest against The Methane Gas project which was Started by Great Eastern Energy Corporation an American multinational. The project was proposed in the Fertile Cauvery Delta region of Tamil Nadu which is a major agricultural region providing food resources for the majority of Tamil Nadu. Nammalvar was the Chief Guest for the practical session conducted on organic farming titled \"iniyellam iyarkai\" (Now all natural) on 20\u201321 July 2013 by the Ramanathapuram district collector.\n\n== Participated in ==\n\n* Movement against the use Chemical Pesticides\n* Movement against Methane extraction in [[Tamil Nadu]]\n* Movement against the introduction of [[Bt brinjal]] in India\n* Movement against the consumption of beef and Trafficking of Cows to kerala\n\n== Forming Vanagam ==\n\nNammalvar founded Nammalvar Ecological Foundation For Farm Research and Global Food Security Trust (NEFFFRGFST) or simply [[Vanagam]] to create public awareness about the benefits of [[Organic Farming]] and about the dangers and difficulties faced in traditional farming practices.

Nammalvar''' (Tamil : \u0b95\u0bcb. \u0ba8\u0bae\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd, 6 April 1938 \u2013 30 December 2013) was an [[India]]n green crusader, agricultural scientist, environmental activist and [[organic farming]] expert best known for his work on spreading [[ecological farming]] and [[organic farming]]. He led the protest against the methane gas project started by [[Great Eastern Energy]] Corporation proposed in the [[Cauvery]] delta region of [[Tamilnadu]]. Nammalvar was the author of several [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]] books on natural farming, natural pesticides & natural fertilizers and was featured in magazines & television programs.\n\n==Life==\n\nNammalvar was born in 1938 in the village of [[Elangadu]] in [[Thanjavur district|Thanjavur District, Tamilnadu]]. He graduated from [[Annamalai University]] with a BSc degree in Agriculture. In 1963, he began working for the Agricultural Regional Research Station, a government organisation in Kovilpatti, as a scientist, conducting trials on spacing and manure levels of various chemical [[fertilizer]]s in cotton and [[millet]] crops. During his tenure there, the government had conducted various experiments in rain fed land, using expensive inputs like hybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides which Nammalvar considered futile as the rain fed farmers were resource poor. Based on his experience, he felt very strongly that it was imperative to totally reorient the research work being undertaken. But his peers at the institute paid little attention to his advice. Frustrated, he left the institute.\n\nFor the next 10 years, he was an agronomist for [[Islands of Peace]], an organisation founded by the Nobel Laureate [[Dominique Pire]]. His focus was on improving the standard of living through agricultural development in the Kalakad block of [[Tirunelveli]] District, Tamil Nadu. It was at this time that he realized that in order to get optimal results in farming, farmers should rely only minimally on external inputs. All inputs should come from within the farm. So-called wastes should be recycled and used as input. This revelation was a turning point in his life. He completely lost trust in conventional farming practices and began experimenting with sustainable agricultural methods.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Nammalvar became greatly influenced by Paulo Freire and Vinoba Bhave and their theories on education. The purpose of education should be freedom. Freedom is essentially self-reliance. Self-sufficiency means that one should not depend on others for one\u2019s daily bread. Secondly, one should have developed the power to acquire knowledge for oneself. And last but not the least, a man should be able to rule himself, to control his thoughts and feelings.\n\nEager to propagate these new theories on education, specifically to aid farmers in becoming self-sufficient, he started a Society, Kudumbam in 1979<ref name=\"Kudumbam\">{{cite web|url=http://kudumbam.in/about%20us.html |title=Kudumbam-About Us |}}</ref>.\n\n\"Participatory Development\" was the way forward. There can be no education without action. Nor can there be any action without education. Both go hand in hand. Nammalvar interacted with local farmers, understood their needs, and based on their input, evolved farming practices suited to the local farmers.<ref>{{cite news|title=G Nammalvar, messiah of organic revolution|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/g-nammalvar-messiah-of-organic-revolution-43246|accessdate=26 February 2018|publisher=Down To Earth|date=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987 G.Nammalvar attended a 4-week training course conducted by the ETC Foundation, Netherlands, on ecological agriculture. In 1990, he founded a network called LEISA (Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture) to promote the concepts of ecological farming, specifically the importance of self-reliability and low external inputs. During the same year, he started an ecological research center for rain-fed cultivation in Pudukottai district.\n\nG.Nammalvar was also greatly influenced by Mr Bernard de-Clerk of Auroville fame, whom he had worked with since 1984. In 1995 he was nominated as the Tamil Nadu state coordinator for ARISE (Agricultural Renewal in India for Sustainable Environment). Concurrently, Bernard was the coordinator at the national level. During his tenure he traveled widely across India promoting the principles of sustainable agriculture.\n\nWhen the tsunami hit India on 26 December 2004, Nammalvar was actively involved in the rehabilitation process. In 2005, he helped farmers across various villages in Nagapattinam district to rehabilitate. Few villages he worked were Mangaimadam, Periya Kuthagai, Therku Pothigai Nallur. In 2006, he left for Indonesia and assisted in reclaiming several farms in tsunami-affected areas.\n\nRecognizing his extensive work in the field of agriculture, the Gandhi Gram Rural University, [[Dindigul|Dindigal]] honored Nammalvar with a Doctorate of Science degree in 2007.\n\nG.Nammalvar traveled widely across the world, observed the agricultural practices in various different ecological systems and based on his findings, trained several farmers and NGO workers. He has written several books and articles in the Tamil language. He had a wide readership across different sections of society. His works may soon be translated to the English language, making his writings easily accessible.\n\nG.Nammalvar spent a substantial part of his time actively touring the south and conducting training classes on ecological farming. He was in the process of setting up several research cum training centers across South India. The first was at Surumanpatti, Kadavur in Karur district. He was also actively involved in linking different farms and institutes around the world so as to accelerate the process of ecological development.<ref>http://www.vikatan.com/new/article.php?module=magazine&aid=34779</ref>\n\nHe led the Historic Protest against The Methane Gas project which was Started by Great Eastern Energy Corporation an American multinational. The project was proposed in the Fertile Cauvery Delta region of Tamil Nadu which is a major agricultural region providing food resources for the majority of Tamil Nadu. Nammalvar was the Chief Guest for the practical session conducted on organic farming titled \"iniyellam iyarkai\" (Now all natural) on 20\u201321 July 2013 by the Ramanathapuram district collector.\n\n== Participated in ==\n\n* Movement against the use Chemical Pesticides\n* Movement against Methane extraction in [[Tamil Nadu]]\n* Movement against the introduction of [[Bt brinjal]] in India\n* Movement against the consumption of beef and Trafficking of Cows to kerala\n\n== Forming Vanagam ==\n\nNammalvar founded Nammalvar Ecological Foundation For Farm Research and Global Food Security Trust (NEFFFRGFST) or simply [[Vanagam]] to create public awareness about the benefits of [[Organic Farming]] and about the dangers and difficulties faced in traditional farming practices. Vanagam is located in [[Karur]], [[Tamilnadu]].\n\n==Death==\nNammalvar died on 30 December 2013, near Pattukottai, due to age-related ailments.
