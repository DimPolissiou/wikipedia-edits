This inheritance was divided among Giovanni and his four brothers, leaving Giovanni with very little.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, his uncle, Vieri de\u2019 Medici, was still a prominent banker in Florence. Vieri helped Giovanni begin his career in the Florentine banking system. He worked his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming a junior partner in the branch located in Rome.<ref name=\":1\" /> Vieri de\u2019 Medici retired in 1393 leaving the bank in the hands of Giovanni.<ref name=\":1\" /> From this point the Medici bank grew vastly and quickly. This growth culminated with the acquisition as the Chief Papal Banker, which meant that the Medici Bank now handled the accounts of the Church.<ref name=\":1\" /> The Medici family bank, which he founded in 1397, became his main commercial interest.

He is widely recognized as a champion of peace, dialogue and human rights.\n\n==Early years==\nMonsengwo Pasinya was born in Mongobele, Diocese of Inongo. He belongs to one of the royal families of [[Sakata language|Basakata]]; his second name, Monsengwo, means \"nephew of the traditional chief\".\n\nHe did his initial ecclesiastical studies at the Seminary of Bokoro and furthered them at the Major Seminary of Kabwe. where he studied philosophy. He was sent to Rome to attend the [[Pontifical Urbaniana University]], and the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]]. He also studied at the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] in [[Jerusalem]], where he was awarded a doctorate in biblical studies. He is the first African to obtain such a doctorate. He studied there under Father [[Carlo Maria Martini]], [[Jesuit|S.J.]] (later cardinal-archbishop of Milan). He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood on 21 December 1963 in Rome. After his ordination he did pastoral work and served as a faculty member at the Theological Faculty of Kinshasa for several years. He served as secretary-general of the Congolese Episcopal Conference from 1976 to 1980.\n\n==Episcopate==\n[[Pope John Paul II]] appointed him [[Titular Bishop]] of Acque Nuove di Proconsulare and Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kisangani|Kisangani]] on 13 February 1980. He was consecrated on 4 May 1980 in [[Kinshasa]] by Pope John Paul II, assisted by [[Agnelo Rossi]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]], and [[Albert-Joseph Malula]], Archbishop of Kinshasa. He served as president of the Congolese Episcopal Conference in 1980 and again in 1992. He was appointed [[metropolitan bishop|Metropoliltan Archbishop]] of Kisangani on 1 September 1988. When dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] was losing his grip on power in the mid-1990s, the country needed someone of unimpeachable integrity to engineer the transition. Monsengwo Pasinya was appointed president of the Sovereign National Conference in 1991, president of the High Council of the Republic in 1992, and speaker of a Transitional Parliament in 1994.

He is widely recognized as a champion of peace, dialogue and human rights.\n\n==Early years==\nMonsengwo Pasinya was born in Mongobele, Diocese of Inongo. He belongs to one of the royal families of [[Sakata language|Basakata]]; his second name, Monsengwo, means \"nephew of the traditional chief\".\n\nHe did his initial ecclesiastical studies at the Seminary of Bokoro and furthered them at the Major Seminary of Kabwe. where he studied philosophy. He was sent to Rome to attend the [[Pontifical Urbaniana University]], and the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]]. He also studied at the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] in [[Jerusalem]], where he was awarded a doctorate in biblical studies. He is the first African to obtain such a doctorate. He studied there under Father [[Carlo Maria Martini]], S.J. (later cardinal-archbishop of Milan). He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood on 21 December 1963 in Rome. After his ordination he did pastoral work and served as a faculty member at the Theological Faculty of Kinshasa for several years. He served as secretary-general of the Congolese Episcopal Conference from 1976 to 1980.\n\n==Episcopate==\n[[Pope John Paul II]] appointed him [[Titular Bishop]] of Acque Nuove di Proconsulare and Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kisangani|Kisangani]] on 13 February 1980.

Coming from a part of Germany close to the Dutch border, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], he spent summer holidays with his family in the Netherlands on the coast near [[Noordwijk]]. The vast beaches and the industrial settings of his hometown Duisburg, influenced his work strongly over the years. In the early 1960s, he moved to [[Lucerne]] and months later to [[Berlin]] where he enrolled in the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Berlin Academy of Fine Arts]]. He hitchhiked to [[Arles]] in the footsteps of his idol, [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Lindbergh recalled these years: \"I preferred actively seeking out van Gogh\u2019s inspirations, my idol, rather than painting the mandatory portraits and landscapes taught in art schools\".

These works were exhibited in the ''Objets ludiques'' exhibition at the [[Tinguely Museum]] in [[Basel]] in 2014. After moving to [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] in 1971, he turned his attention to photography and worked for two years assisting German photographer Hans Lux, before opening his own studio in 1973.

In 1971 he turned to photography and worked for the ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine.\n\nIn fashion photography, he portrayed models [[Linda Evangelista]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Tatjana Patitz]], [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Christy Turlington]] together for the January 1990 [[British Vogue]] cover, beginning an era of [[supermodel]]s. He twice photographed the [[Pirelli Calendar]], made several films, and created covers for music including Tina Turner's ''[[Foreign Affair (Tina Turner album)|Foreign Affair]]'', Sheryl Crow's ''[[The Globe Sessions]]'' and Beyonc\u00e9's ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]''.\n\nHis work has been presented at international exhibitions. Lindbergh preferred black & white photography, and noted in 2014: \"This should be the responsibility of photographers today to free women, and finally everyone, from the terror of youth and perfection.\"\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Peter Lindbergh, New York, 2016 (\u00a9 Stefan Rappo).jpg|thumb|Lindbergh, New York, 2016]] Lindbergh was born on 23 November 1944 in [[Leszno|Lissa (Leszno)]], [[Reichsgau Wartheland]], [[German-occupied Poland]]. He spent his childhood in [[Duisburg]].<ref name=bio>\"[http://www.peterlindbergh.com/#BIOGRAPHY Biographical overview]\", peterlindbergh.net. Accessed 16 November 2011.</ref>\n\nAs a teenager, he worked as [[window dresser]] for the [[Horten AG#Former Horten Department Stores|Karstadt and Horten department stores]] in Duisburg. Coming from a part of Germany close to the Dutch border, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], he spent summer holidays with his family in the Netherlands on the coast near [[Noordwijk]]. The vast beaches and the industrial settings of his hometown Duisburg, influenced his work strongly over the years. In the early 1960s, he moved to [[Lucerne]] and months later to [[Berlin]] where he enrolled in the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Berlin Academy of Fine Arts]]. He hitchhiked to [[Arles]] in the footsteps of his idol, [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Lindbergh recalled these years: \"I preferred actively seeking out van Gogh\u2019s inspirations, my idol, rather than painting the mandatory portraits and landscapes taught in art schools\". After several months in Arles, he continued through to [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]], a journey which took him two years.<ref name=\"maker\">{{cite news |author=Ian Phillips |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/the-image-maker-1239216.html |title=THE IMAGE MAKER &#124; News &#124; Lifestyle |publisher=The Independent |date=13 September 1997 |accessdate=29 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034212/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/the-image-maker-1239216.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nReturning to Germany, he studied [[abstract art]] at the Kunsthochschule (College of Art) in [[Krefeld]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with [[G\u00fcnther C. Kirchberger]]. Influenced by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and the [[conceptual art]] movement, he was invited in 1969, before graduating, to present his work at the avant-garde Galerie Denise Ren\u00e9.

Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017.

It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014.

Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017.

He insisted that, contrary to international law, if Ukraine signed the agreement, from a legal point of view, the Ukrainian government would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries' borders.

It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014.
