It was used together with concepts of the United States as an ideal [[Republicanism|republic]] and a \"[[city upon a hill]]\" or new [[promised land]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It was a metaphor for the idealized process of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] and [[Colonization of the Americas|colonization]] by which different nationalities, cultures and \"races\" (a term that could encompass nationality, ethnicity and racist views of humanity) were to blend into a new, virtuous community, and it was connected to [[utopian]] visions of the emergence of an American \"[[New Man (utopian concept)|new man]]\". While \"melting\" was in common use the exact term \"melting pot\" came into general usage in 1908, after the premiere of the play ''[[The Melting Pot (play)|The Melting Pot]]'' by [[Israel Zangwill]].\n\nThe first use in American literature of the concept of immigrants \"melting\" into the receiving culture are found in the writings of [[J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur]]. In his ''[[Letters from an American Farmer]]'' (1782) Crevecoeur writes, in response to his own question, \"What then is the American, this new man?\" that the American is one who \"leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.  He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great [[Alma Mater]].  Here individuals of all nations are ''melted'' into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world.\"\n\n{{quote|...whence came all these people? They are a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes... What, then, is the American, this new man? He is either an European or the descendant of an European; hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose son married a French woman, and whose present four sons have now four wives of different nations. He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.... The Americans were once scattered all over Europe; here they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population which has ever appeared.\n|J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, ''Letters from an American Farmer''}}\n\nIn 1845, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], alluding to the development of European civilization out of the medieval [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], wrote in his private journal of America as the Utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed \"[[smelting]] pot\", but only in 1912 were his remarks first published. In his writing, Emerson explicitly welcomed the racial intermixing of whites and non-whites, a highly controversial view during his lifetime.\n\nA magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly:\n\n{{quote|The fusing process goes on as in a [[Blast furnace|blast-furnace]]; one generation, a single year even\u2014transforms the English, the German, the Irish emigrant into an American. Uniform institutions, ideas, language, the influence of the majority, bring us soon to a similar complexion; the individuality of the immigrant, almost even his traits of race and religion, fuse down in the democratic alembic like chips of brass thrown into the melting pot.<ref>Titus Munson Coan, \"A New Country\", ''The Galaxy'' Volume 0019, Issue 4 (April 1875), p. 463 [http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=gala&cc=gala&xc=1&idno=gala0019-4&g=moagrp&q1=melting+pot&node=gala0019-4%3A3&frm=frameset&view=image&seq=465 online]</ref>}}\n\nIn 1893, historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one American culture. In his essay ''[[The Significance of the Frontier in American History]]'', he referred to the \"composite nationality\" of the American people, arguing that the [[frontier]] had functioned as a \"[[crucible]]\" where \"the immigrants were Americanized, liberated and fused into a mixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics\".\n\nIn his 1905 travel narrative ''[[The American Scene]]'', [[Henry James]] discusses cultural intermixing in New York City as a \"fusion, as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot\".<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Henry|title=The American Scene|url=https://archive.org/details/americanscene000jame|url-access=registration|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1968|isbn=0861550188}}, p. 116</ref>\n\nThe exact term \"melting pot\" came into general usage in the United States after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities, cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 [[The Melting Pot (play)|play of the same name]], first performed in [[Washington, D.C.]], where the immigrant protagonist declared: {{quote|Understand that America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming! Here you stand, good folk, think I, when I see them at Ellis Island, here you stand in your fifty groups, your fifty languages, and histories, and your fifty blood hatreds and rivalries. But you won't be long like that, brothers, for these are the fires of God you've come to\u2014these are fires of God. A fig for your feuds and vendettas! Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians\u2014into the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.<ref>As quoted in [[Gary Gerstle]] ''American Crucible; Race and Nation in the Twentieth Century,'' Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 51. Hirschman, C. \"America's Melting Pot Policy Reconsidered\", ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 9, 1983, 397\u2013423 (p. 397).</ref>}}\n\n; Israel Zangwill\nIn ''The Melting Pot'' (1908), Israel Zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing. The play was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', set in New York City. The play's immigrant protagonist David Quixano, a Russian Jew, falls in love with Vera, a fellow Russian immigrant who is Christian. Vera is an idealistic [[settlement house]] worker and David is a composer struggling to create an \"American symphony\" to celebrate his adopted homeland. Together they manage to overcome the old world animosities that threaten to separate them. But then David discovers that Vera is the daughter of the Tsarist officer who directed the [[pogrom]] that forced him to flee Russia. Horrified, he breaks up with her, betraying his belief in the possibility of transcending religious and ethnic animosities. However, unlike Shakespeare's tragedy,  there is a happy ending. At the end of the play the lovers are reconciled.\n\nReunited with Vera and watching the setting sun gilding the [[Statue of Liberty]], David Quixano has a prophetic vision: \"It is the Fires of God round His Crucible. There she lies, the great Melting-Pot\u2014Listen! Can't you hear the roaring and the bubbling? There gapes her mouth, the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight\". David foresees how the American melting pot will make the nation's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people: \"Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, Vera, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all\nraces and nations come to labour and look forward!\"\n\nZangwill thus combined the metaphor of the \"crucible\" or \"melting pot\" with a celebration of the United States as an ideal republic and a new promised land. The prophetic words of his Jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty allude to [[Emma Lazarus]]'s famous poem ''[[The New Colossus]]'' (1883), which celebrated the statue as a symbol of American democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/destinationamerica/usim_qz1b.html|title=Take the Quiz|date=September 2005|work=Destination America|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\nZangwill concludes his play by wishing, \"Peace, peace, to all ye unborn millions, fated to fill this giant continent\u2014the God of our children give you Peace.\" Expressing his hope that through this forging process the \"unborn millions\" who would become America's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity.\n\n==United States==\nIn terms of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the United States]], the \"melting pot\" process has been equated with [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]], that is, [[cultural assimilation]] and [[acculturation]]. The \"melting pot\" metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of [[ethnicities]], yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage. Thus African-Americans are fully culturally integrated into American culture and institutions. Yet more than a century after the abolition of slavery, intermarriage between African-Americans and other ethnicities is much less common than between different white ethnicities, or between white and Asian ethnicities. Intermarriage between whites and non-whites, and especially African-Americans, was a taboo in the United States for a long time, and was illegal in many US states (see [[anti-miscegenation laws]]) until 1967.<ref name=\"Hollinger\">{{cite journal|last=Hollinger|first=David A.|date=December 2003|title=Amalgamation and Hypodescent: The Question of Ethnoracial Mixture in the History of the United States|journal=The American Historical Review|publisher=Indiana University|volume=108|issue=5|pages=1363\u201390|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/108.5/hollinger.html|accessdate=2008-07-15|doi=10.1086/529971|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802031739/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/108.5/hollinger.html|archivedate=2012-08-02}}</ref>\n\n===Whiteness and the melting pot in the United States===\nThe melting pot theory of ethnic relations, which sees American identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups, has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of [[whiteness studies]]. This discipline examines the \"[[social construction]] of whiteness\" and highlights the changing ways in which whiteness has been normative to American national identity from the 17th to the 20th century.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European [[immigration]] to the United States became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers. Beginning in the 1890s, large numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups such as the [[Italian Americans|Italians]], [[American Jew|Jews]], and [[Polish Americans|Poles]] arrived. Many returned to Europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot, adopting American lifestyles.<ref>[[Thomas J. Archdeacon]], ''Becoming American'' (1984) pp. 112\u201325</ref> By contrast, Chinese arrivals met intense hostility and  [[Chinese Exclusion Act|new laws in the 1880s]] tried to exclude them, but many arrived illegally. Hostility forced them into \"Chinatowns\" or ethnic enclaves in the larger cities, where they lived a culture apart and seldom assimilated. The acquisition of Hawaii in 1898, with full citizenship for the residents of all races, greatly increased the Asian American population.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation or the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: \"Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like [[Henry Ford]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]], or was the idea instead that everyone, ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendants and Sicilians, [[Ashkenazi]] and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?\"<ref name=\"Hollinger\" />\n\n[[Nativists]] wanted to severely restrict access to the melting pot. They felt that far too many \"undesirables,\" or in their view, culturally inferior immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe had already arrived. The compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small, and, apart from family reunification, the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time.<ref>Higham (1955) {{page needed|date=October 2018}}</ref> National quotas were established that discouraged immigration from Poland, Italy and Russia, and encouraged immigration from Britain, Ireland and Germany.\n\n====Native Americans====\nIntermarriage between Euro-American men and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women has been common since colonial days. In the 21st century some 7.5 million Americans claim Native American ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Matthew Snipp|title=American Indians: The First of this Land|url=https://archive.org/details/americanindiansf00sniprich|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|page=[https://archive.org/details/americanindiansf00sniprich/page/n88 53]|isbn=978-1610445092}}</ref>  In the 1920s the nation welcomed celebrities of Native American background, especially [[Will Rogers]] and [[Jim Thorpe]], as well as Vice President [[Charles Curtis]], who had been brought up on a reservation and identified with his Indian heritage.\n\n====Miscegenation====\nThe mixing of whites and blacks, resulting in multiracial children, for which the term \"[[miscegenation]]\" was coined in 1863, was a taboo, and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks. In many states, marriage between whites and non-whites was even prohibited by [[state law]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]]. As a result, two kinds of \"mixture talk\" developed:\n\n{{quote|\nAs the new word\u2014miscegenation\u2014became associated with black-white mixing, a preoccupation of the years after the Civil War, the residual European immigrant aspect of the question of [ethnoracial mixture] came to be more than ever a thing apart, discussed all the more easily without any reference to the African-American aspect of the question. This separation of mixture talk into two discourses facilitated, and was in turn reinforced by, the process [[Matthew Frye Jacobson]] has detailed whereby European immigrant groups became less ambiguously white and more definitely \"not black\".<ref name=\"Hollinger\" />}}\n\nBy the early 21st century, many white Americans celebrated the impact of African-American culture, especially in sports and music. Marriages between white Americans and African-Americans were still problematic in both communities. Israel Zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century: \"However scrupulously and justifiably America avoids intermarriage with the negro, the comic spirit cannot fail to note spiritual miscegenation which, while clothing, commercializing, and Christianizing the ex-African, has given '[[rag-time]]' and the sex-dances that go with it, first to white America and then to the whole white world.\"<ref name=\"Rogin\">{{cite journal|last=Rogin|first=Michael|date=December 1992|title=Making America Home: Racial Masquerade and Ethnic Assimilation in the Transition to Talking Pictures|journal=The Journal of American History|publisher=Organization of American Historians|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1050\u201377|accessdate=2011-05-14|doi=10.2307/2080798|jstor=2080798|url=http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4455.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807164904/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4455.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Multiracial influences on culture===\nWhite Americans long regarded some elements of [[African-American culture]] quintessentially \"American\", while at the same time treating African Americans as second-class citizens. White appropriation, stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which European immigrants could express themselves as Americans, through such traditions as [[blackface]], [[minstrel show]]s and later in [[jazz]] and in early Hollywood cinema, notably in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927).<ref name=\"Rogin\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the \"racial masquerade\" that was involved in creation of a white \"melting pot\" culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century, historian Michael Rogin has commented: \"Repudiating 1920s nativism, these films [Rogin discusses ''The Jazz Singer'', ''[[Old San Francisco]]'' (1927), ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]]'' (1930), ''[[King of Jazz]]'' (1930) celebrate the melting pot. Unlike other racially stigmatized groups, white immigrants can put on and take off their mask of difference. But the freedom promised immigrants to make themselves over points to the vacancy, the violence, the deception, and the melancholy at the core of American self-fashioning\".<ref name=\"Rogin\"/>\n\nSince World War II, the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the United States, gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites.\n\n====Ethnicity in films====\nThis trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of World War II, starting with [[Bataan (film)|''Bataan'']] (1943). This film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between Americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial American unit. At the time blacks and Japanese in the armed forces were still segregated, while Chinese and Indians were in integrated units.\n\nHistorian [[Richard Slotkin]] sees ''Bataan'' and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the \"melting pot platoon\", a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s \"an American community that did not yet exist\", and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation. However, Slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the Japanese enemy: \"the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred...The final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of 'dirty monkeys.'\" He sees this racist rage as an expression of \"the unresolved tension between racialism and civic egalitarianism in American life\".<ref name=\"Slotkin\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/alh/13.3.469|last=Slotkin|first=Richard |date=Fall 2001|title=Unit Pride: Ethnic Platoons and the Myths of American Nationality|journal=American Literary History|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|volume=13|issue=9|pages=469\u201398|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/american_literary_history/v013/13.3slotkin.html|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\n====Hawaii====\nIn Hawaii, as Rohrer (2008) argues, there are two dominant discourses of racial politics, both focused on \"[[haole]]\" (white people or whiteness in Hawaii) in the islands. The first is the discourse of racial harmony representing Hawaii as an idyllic racial paradise with no conflict or inequality. There is also a competing discourse of discrimination against nonlocals, which contends that \"haoles\" and nonlocal people of color are disrespected and treated unfairly in Hawaii. As negative referents for each other, these discourses work to reinforce one another and are historically linked. Rohrer proposes that the question of racial politics be reframed toward consideration of the processes of racialization themselves\u2014toward a new way of thinking about racial politics in Hawaii that breaks free of the not racist/racist dyad.<ref>Judy Rohrer, \"Disrupting the 'Melting Pot': Racial Discourse in Hawai'i and the Naturalization of Haole.\" ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' 2008 31(6): 1110\u201325</ref>\n\n====Olympics====\nThroughout the history of the modern Olympic Games, the theme of the United States as a melting pot has been employed to explain American athletic success, becoming an important aspect of national self-image. The diversity of American athletes in the Olympic Games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid-a massive influx of immigrants, as well as American Indians (represented by [[Jim Thorpe]] in 1912) and blacks (represented by [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936). In the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], two black American athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the U.S. national anthem with [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|a \"Black Power\" salute]] that symbolized rejection of assimilation.<ref>Henry Louis Gates and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham (2004). ''African American lives''. p. 5 {{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nThe international aspect of the games allowed the United States to define its pluralistic self-image against the monolithic traditions of other nations. American athletes served as cultural ambassadors of [[American exceptionalism]], promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of America as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture. Journalists and other American analysts of the Olympics framed their comments with patriotic nationalism, stressing that the success of U.S. athletes, especially in the high-profile track-and-field events, stemmed not from simple athletic prowess but from the superiority of the civilization that spawned them.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]] strongly revived the melting pot image, returning to a bedrock form of American nationalism and patriotism. The reemergence of Olympic melting pot discourse was driven especially by the unprecedented success of [[African Americans]], [[Mexican Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], and [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] in events traditionally associated with Europeans and white North Americans such as speed skating and the bobsled.<ref>Mark Dyerson, \"'America's Athletic Missionaries': Political Performance, Olympic Spectacle and the Quest for an American National Culture, 1896\u20131912,\" ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(2): 185\u2013203; Dyerson, \"Return to the Melting Pot: An Old American Olympic Story,\"  ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(2): 204\u201323</ref> The 2002 Winter Olympics was also a showcase of American religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of Utah's large majority population of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], as well representation of [[Muslim Americans]] and other religious groups in the U.S. Olympic team.<ref>Ethan R.

The concept of cultural pluralism first emerged in the 1910s and 1920s among intellectual circles out of the debates in the United States over how to approach issues of immigration and national identity.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe [[First World War]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] caused a \"[[Red Scare]]\" in the US, which also fanned feelings of [[xenophobia]]. During and immediately after the First World War, the concept of the melting pot was equated by [[Nativists]] with complete cultural assimilation towards an Anglo-American norm (\"Anglo-conformity\") on the part of immigrants, and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the United States.\n\nThe newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with \"Americanization\", meaning cultural assimilation, by many \"old stock\" Americans. In [[Henry Ford]]'s Ford English School (established in 1914), the graduation ceremony for immigrant employees involved symbolically stepping off an immigrant ship and passing through ''the melting pot'', entering at one end in costumes designating their nationality and emerging at the other end in identical suits and waving American flags.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/FordEnglishSchool.htm|title=Ford English School|work=Automobile in American Life and Society|publisher=University of Michigan |location=Dearborn|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/UFRLCE/DepAnglais/cours/civi/immigration.html|title=Immigration|publisher=University of Nancy|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to the absorption of millions of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was especially strong among popular writers such as [[Madison Grant]] and [[Lothrop Stoddard]], who believed in the \"racial\" superiority of Americans of Northern European descent as member of the \"[[Nordicism|Nordic race]]\", and therefore demanded immigration restrictions to stop a \"degeneration\" of America's white racial \"stock\". They believed that complete cultural assimilation of the immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was not a solution to the problem of immigration because intermarriage with these immigrants would endanger the [[racial purity]] of Anglo-America. The controversy over immigration faded away after immigration restrictions were put in place with the enactment of the [[Johnson-Reed Act]] in 1924.\n\nIn response to the pressure exerted on immigrants to culturally assimilate and also as a reaction against the denigration of the culture of non-Anglo white immigrants by Nativists, intellectuals on the left, such as [[Horace Kallen]] in ''Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot'' (1915), and [[Randolph Bourne]] in ''Trans-National America'' (1916), laid the foundations for the concept of [[cultural pluralism]]. This term was coined by Kallen.<ref>Noam Pianko, \"'The True Liberalism of Zionism': Horace Kallen, Jewish Nationalism, and the Limits of American Pluralism,\" ''American Jewish History,'' December 2008, Vol. 94, Issue 4, pp. 299\u2013329,</ref> Randolph Bourne, who objected to Kallen's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference, envisioned a \"trans-national\" and [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] America. The concept of cultural pluralism was popularized in the 1940s by [[John Dewey]].\n\nIn the United States, where the term melting pot is still commonly used, the ideas of [[cultural pluralism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have, in some circles, taken precedence over the idea of assimilation.<ref name=\"Miton\">{{cite book |last=Milton |first=Gordon |title=Assimilation in American Life |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1964 |isbn=0195008960 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/assimilationinam0000gord }}</ref><ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\">{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  |author2=Strother-Adams, Pearlie | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co | location =Chicago | isbn = 078728145X}}</ref><ref name=\"Glazer\">{{cite book|last=Glazer|first=Nathan|author2=Moynihan, Daniel P.|title=Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York City|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|year=1970|edition=2nd|isbn=026257022X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondmeltingpot0000glaz}}</ref> Alternate models where immigrants retain their native cultures such as the \"salad bowl\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsavvy.com/understanding_american_culture.htm|title=Understanding American Culture: From Melting Pot to Salad Bowl|last=Millet|first=Joyce |publisher=Cultural Savvy|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> or the \"symphony\"<ref name=\"Miton\" /> are more often used by sociologists to describe how cultures and ethnicities mix in the United States. Nonetheless, the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt, such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language.\n\nSince the 1960s, much research in Sociology and History has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the United States and other counties.<ref name=\"Miton\" /><ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\" /><ref name=\"Glazer\" /> The theory of [[multiculturalism]] offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including ''[[salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] theory'', or, as it is known in [[Canada]], the ''[[cultural mosaic]]''. In the 1990s, [[political correctness]] in the United States emphasized that each ethnic and national group has the right to maintain and preserve its cultural distinction and integrity, and that one does not need to assimilate or abandon one's heritage in order to blend in or merge into the majority Anglo-American society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nNevertheless, some prominent scholars, such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] in ''[[Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity]]'', have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day United States culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot, assimilation, and Anglo-conformity models. Under this theory, it is asserted that the United States has one of the most homogeneous cultures of any nation in the world. This line of thought holds that this American national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from Britain, Ireland, and Germany. When more recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe brought their various cultures to America at the beginning of the 20th century, they changed the American cultural landscape just very slightly and, for the most part, assimilated into America's pre-existing culture, which had its origins in Northwestern Europe.\n\nThe decision of whether to support a melting-pot or multicultural approach has developed into an issue of much debate within some countries. For example, the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|French]] and British governments and populace are currently debating whether Islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries.<ref name=\"Cowell\">{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/15/news/brits.php|title=Islamic schools at heart of British debate on integration|last=Cowell|first=Alan |date=2006-10-15|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==Use in other regions==\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Kroisos BMC 31.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Gold [[croeseid]] of [[Croesus]] c.550 BC, depicting the Lydian lion and Greek bull - partly in recognition of transnational parentage.]]In more ancient times, some marriages between distinctly different tribes and nations were due to royalty trying to form alliances with or to influence other kingdoms or to dissuade marauders or slave traders.

Mexico, beginning with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztecs]], had entered a new global empire based on trade and immigration. In the 16th and 17th centuries, waves of Spanish, and to a lesser extent, African and Filipino culture became embedded into the fabric of Mexican culture. It is important to note, however, that from a Mexican standpoint, the immigrants and their culture were no longer considered foreign, but Mexican in their entirety. The food, art, and even heritage were assimilated into a Mexican identity. Upon the [[independence of Mexico]], Mexico began receiving immigrants from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again, bringing many cultural influences but being quickly labeled as Mexican, unlike in the United States, where other culture is considered foreign. This assimilation is very evident, even in Mexican society today: for example, [[banda music|banda]], a style of music originating in northern Mexico, is simply a Mexican take on Central European music brought by immigrants in the 18th century. Mexico's thriving beer industry was also the result of German brewers finding refuge in Mexico. Many famous Mexicans are actually of Arab descent; [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Carlos Slim]]. The coastal states of [[Guerrero]] and [[Veracruz]] are inhabited by citizens of African descent. Mexico's national policy is based on the concept of [[mestizaje]], a word meaning \"to mix\". The immigrants are socially under pressure to adopt a Mexican nationality and become part of the broader culture (speaking Spanish, respect the Catholic heritage, help the society), while contributing useful cultural traits foreign to Mexican society.\n\n===South America===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}\n\n====Argentina====\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as [[Demography of Canada|Canada]], [[Demography of Australia|Australia]], the [[Demography of the United States|United States]], [[Demography of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Demography of New Zealand|New Zealand]],  [[Demographics of the United Arab Emirates|The United Arab Emirates]], and [[Demographics of Singapore|Singapore]], Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669 |title=About Argentina |publisher=Government of Argentina |accessdate=2009-09-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919230812/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669 |archivedate=2009-09-19 }}</ref> When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of newer settlement like Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand;<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 June 2007|accessdate=22 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite web|url=http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf |title=European Immigration into South America, 1870\u20131930 |last=S\u00e1nchez-Alonso |first=Blanca |publisher=Universidad San Pablo-CEU |location=Madrid |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf |archivedate=August 14, 2011 }}</ref> and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the [[immigration to Argentina]] becomes evident.\n\nMost Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers and of the 19th- and 20th-century [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|immigrants from Europe]].

From [[Colonial Brazil|colonial times]] [[Portuguese Brazilians]] have favoured assimilation and tolerance for other peoples, and intermarriage was more acceptable in Brazil than in most other European colonies. However, Brazilian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. Brazilians of mainly European descent (Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Austrian, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, etc.) account for more than half the population, although people of mixed ethnic backgrounds form an increasingly larger segment; roughly two-fifths of the total are mulattoes (''mulattos''; people of mixed African and European ancestry) and mestizos (''mesti\u00e7os'', or ''caboclos''; people of mixed European and Indian ancestry). Portuguese are the main European ethnic group in Brazil, and most Brazilians can trace their ancestry to an [[Portuguese people|ethnic Portuguese]] or a mixed-race Portuguese. Among European descendants, Brazil has the largest [[Italian-Brazilian|Italian diaspora]], the second largest [[German-Brazilian|German diaspora]], as well as other European groups. The country is also home to the largest [[Japanese diaspora]] outside Japan, the [[Arab diaspora|largest Arab community outside the Arab World]] and one of the [[Jews in Brazil|top 10 Jewish populations]].\n\n====Colombia====\nColombia is a melting pot of races and ethnicities. The population is descended from three racial groups\u2014Native Americans, blacks, and whites\u2014that have mingled throughout the nearly 500 years of the country's history. No official figures were available, since the Colombian government dropped any references to race in the census after 1918, but according to rough estimates in the late 1980s, mestizos (white and Native American mix) constituted approximately 50% of the population, whites (predominantly Spanish origin, Italian, German, French, etc.) made a 25%, mulattoes (black-white mix) 14% and zambos  (black and Native American mix) 4%, blacks (pure or predominantly of African origin) 3% percent, and Native Americans 1%.\n\n====Costa Rica====\n[[Costa Rica]]n people is a very syncretic melting pot, because this country has been constituted in percentage since the 16th century by immigrants from all the European countries\u2014mostly [[Spaniards]] and [[Italians]] with a lot of [[Germans]], [[british people|British]], [[Swedes]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[french people|French]] and [[Croats]]\u2014also as [[black people]] from Africa and Jamaica, [[Americans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Latin Americans]] who have mestized over time with the large native populations (criollos, castizos, mulattos, blacks and tri-racial) creating the national average modern ethnic composition.<ref>{{cite web|last1=D'Onofrio|first1=S|last2=Campos|first2=A|last3=Guill\u00e9n|first3=F|title=Multiculturalidad en Costa Rica: los inmigrantes y sus descendientes|url=https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4301/35136576774_fbbeee0cee_o.jpg|publisher=Sicultura|language= Spanish|accessdate=6 January 2018|format=JPG|date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nNowadays a great part of the Costa Rican inhabitants are considered white (84%), with minority groups of mulatto (7%), indigenous (2%), Chinese (2%) and black (1%).

Various groups of people have been intermarrying for millennia in the Indian subcontinent, including speakers of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] languages. On account of such diverse influences, the Indian subcontinent in a nut-shell appears to be a cradle of human civilization. Despite invasions in its recent history it has succeeded in organically assimilating incoming influences, blunting their wills for imperialistic hegemony and maintaining its strong roots and culture. These invasions, however, brought their own racial mixing between diverse populations and the Indian subcontinent is considered an exemplary \"melting pot\" (and not a \"salad bowl\") by many geneticists for exactly this reason. However, society in the Indian subcontinent has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. Ethnic conflicts in [[Pakistan]] between [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], [[Punjabis]], and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s, are other impediments to the melting pot thesis.\n\n===Afghanistan===\nAfghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot, as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of Afghanistan. The term ''Afghan'' was originally used to refer to the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] in the Middle Ages, and the intention behind the creation of the Afghan state was originally to be a [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun state]], but later this policy changed, leading to the inclusion of non-Pashtuns in the state as Afghans. Today in Afghanistan, the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring, where different Afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new Afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in Afghanistan today, ultimately replacing the old Pashtun identity which stood for Afghan. With the churning growth of [[Persian language|Persian]], many ethnic groups, including de-tribalized Pashtuns, are adopting Dari Persian as their new native tongue. Many ethnic groups in Afghanistan tolerate each other, while the [[Hazara people|Hazara]]\u2013Pashtun conflict was notable, and often claimed as a [[Shia-Sunni relations|Shia-Sunni conflict]] instead of ethnic conflict, as this conflict was carried out by the [[Taliban]]. The Taliban, which are mostly ethnically Pashtun, have spurred Anti-Pashtunism across non-Pashtun Afghans. Pashtun\u2013[[Tajik people|Tajik]] rivalries have lingered about, but are much milder. Reasons for this antipathy are criticism of Tajiks (for either their non-tribal culture or cultural rivalry in Afghanistan) by Pashtuns and criticism of Taliban (mostly composed of Pashtuns) by Tajiks. There have been rivalries between Pashtuns and [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] as well, which is likely very similar to the [[Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010|Kyrgyzstan Crisis]], which Pashtuns would likely take place as [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] (for having a similar nomadic culture), rivaling with Tajiks and Uzbeks (of sedentary culture), despite all being [[Sunni]] Muslims.\n\n===Israel===\n\nIn the early years of the state of [[Israel]], the term ''melting pot'' (\u05db\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05da), also known as \"Ingathering of the Exiles\" (\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea), was not a description of a process, but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the Jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures (see [[Jewish ethnic divisions]]).  This was performed on several levels, such as educating the younger generation (with the parents not having the final say) and (to mention an anecdotal one) encouraging and sometimes forcing the new citizens to adopt a Hebrew name.\n\nActivists such as the Iraq-born [[Ella Shohat]] that an elite which developed in the early 20th century, out of the earlier-arrived Zionist Pioneers of the Second and Third [[Aliyah|Aliyas]] (immigration waves)\u2014and who gained a dominant position in the [[Yishuv]] (pre-state community) since the 1930s\u2014had formulated a new Hebrew culture, based on the values of [[Socialist Zionism]], and imposed it on all later arrivals, at the cost of suppressing and erasing these later immigrants' original culture.\n\nProponents of the Melting Pot policy asserted that it applied to all newcomers to Israel equally; specifically, that [[Eastern European]] Jews were pressured to discard their [[Yiddish]]-based culture as ruthlessly as [[Mizrahi]] Jews were pressured to give up the culture which they developed during centuries of life in Arab and Muslim countries. Critics respond, however, that a cultural change effected by a struggle within the [[Ashkenazi]]-East European community, with younger people voluntarily discarding their ancestral culture and formulating a new one, is not parallel to the subsequent exporting and imposing of this new culture on others, who had no part in formulating it. Also, it was asserted that extirpating the Yiddish culture had been in itself an act of oppression only compounding what was done to the Mizrahi immigrants.\n\nToday the reaction to this doctrine is ambivalent; some say that it was a necessary measure in the founding years, while others claim that it amounted to cultural [[oppression]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Liphshiz|first=Cnaan|title=Melting pot' approach in the army was a mistake, says IDF absorption head|url=http://www.haaretz.com/melting-pot-approach-in-the-army-was-a-mistake-says-idf-absorption-head-1.245477|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> Others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target: for example, the persons born in Israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population.<ref>Yitzhaki, Shlomo and [[Schechtman, Edna]] ''The \"Melting Pot\": A Success Story?''

This primarily consisted of the Chinese, Indian and Arab traders. This is also includes neighboring southeast Asian cultures. The cultures and races mixed with indigenous tribes, mainly of Austronesian descent (i.e. the Indonesians, Malays and Brunei) and the [[Negrito]]s. The result was a mix of cultures and ideals. This melting pot of culture continued with the arrival of Europeans, mixing their western culture with the nation. The [[Spanish Empire]] colonized the Philippines for more than three centuries, and during the early 20th century, was conquered and annexed by the United States and occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. In modern times, the Philippines has been the place of many retired Americans, Japanese expatriates and Korean students.

It was used together with concepts of the United States as an ideal [[Republicanism|republic]] and a \"[[city upon a hill]]\" or new [[promised land]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It was a metaphor for the idealized process of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] and [[Colonization of the Americas|colonization]] by which different nationalities, cultures and \"races\" (a term that could encompass nationality, ethnicity and racist views of humanity) were to blend into a new, virtuous community, and it was connected to [[utopian]] visions of the emergence of an American \"[[New Man (utopian concept)|new man]]\". While \"melting\" was in common use the exact term \"melting pot\" came into general usage in 1908, after the premiere of the play ''[[The Melting Pot (play)|The Melting Pot]]'' by [[Israel Zangwill]].\n\nThe first use in American literature of the concept of immigrants \"melting\" into the receiving culture are found in the writings of [[J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur]]. In his ''[[Letters from an American Farmer]]'' (1782) Crevecoeur writes, in response to his own question, \"What then is the American, this new man?\" that the American is one who \"leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.  He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great [[Alma Mater]].  Here individuals of all nations are ''melted'' into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world.\"\n\n{{quote|...whence came all these people? They are a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes... What, then, is the American, this new man? He is either an European or the descendant of an European; hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose son married a French woman, and whose present four sons have now four wives of different nations. He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.... The Americans were once scattered all over Europe; here they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population which has ever appeared.\n|J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, ''Letters from an American Farmer''}}\n\nIn 1845, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], alluding to the development of European civilization out of the medieval [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], wrote in his private journal of America as the Utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed \"[[smelting]] pot\", but only in 1912 were his remarks first published. In his writing, Emerson explicitly welcomed the racial intermixing of whites and non-whites, a highly controversial view during his lifetime.\n\nA magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly:\n\n{{quote|The fusing process goes on as in a [[Blast furnace|blast-furnace]]; one generation, a single year even\u2014transforms the English, the German, the Irish emigrant into an American. Uniform institutions, ideas, language, the influence of the majority, bring us soon to a similar complexion; the individuality of the immigrant, almost even his traits of race and religion, fuse down in the democratic alembic like chips of brass thrown into the melting pot.<ref>Titus Munson Coan, \"A New Country\", ''The Galaxy'' Volume 0019, Issue 4 (April 1875), p. 463 [http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=gala&cc=gala&xc=1&idno=gala0019-4&g=moagrp&q1=melting+pot&node=gala0019-4%3A3&frm=frameset&view=image&seq=465 online]</ref>}}\n\nIn 1893, historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one American culture. In his essay ''[[The Significance of the Frontier in American History]]'', he referred to the \"composite nationality\" of the American people, arguing that the [[frontier]] had functioned as a \"[[crucible]]\" where \"the immigrants were Americanized, liberated and fused into a mixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics\".\n\nIn his 1905 travel narrative ''[[The American Scene]]'', [[Henry James]] discusses cultural intermixing in New York City as a \"fusion, as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot\".<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Henry|title=The American Scene|url=https://archive.org/details/americanscene000jame|url-access=registration|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1968|isbn=0861550188}}, p. 116</ref>\n\nThe exact term \"melting pot\" came into general usage in the United States after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities, cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 [[The Melting Pot (play)|play of the same name]], first performed in [[Washington, D.C.]], where the immigrant protagonist declared: {{quote|Understand that America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming!

Hirschman, C. \"America's Melting Pot Policy Reconsidered\", ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 9, 1983, 397\u2013423 (p. 397).</ref>}}\n\n; Israel Zangwill\nIn ''The Melting Pot'' (1908), Israel Zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing. The play was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', set in New York City. The play's immigrant protagonist David Quixano, a Russian Jew, falls in love with Vera, a fellow Russian immigrant who is Christian. Vera is an idealistic [[settlement house]] worker and David is a composer struggling to create an \"American symphony\" to celebrate his adopted homeland. Together they manage to overcome the old world animosities that threaten to separate them. But then David discovers that Vera is the daughter of the Tsarist officer who directed the [[pogrom]] that forced him to flee Russia. Horrified, he breaks up with her, betraying his belief in the possibility of transcending religious and ethnic animosities. However, unlike Shakespeare's tragedy,  there is a happy ending. At the end of the play the lovers are reconciled.\n\nReunited with Vera and watching the setting sun gilding the [[Statue of Liberty]], David Quixano has a prophetic vision: \"It is the Fires of God round His Crucible. There she lies, the great Melting-Pot\u2014Listen! Can't you hear the roaring and the bubbling? There gapes her mouth, the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight\". David foresees how the American melting pot will make the nation's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people: \"Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, Vera, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all\nraces and nations come to labour and look forward!\"\n\nZangwill thus combined the metaphor of the \"crucible\" or \"melting pot\" with a celebration of the United States as an ideal republic and a new promised land. The prophetic words of his Jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty allude to [[Emma Lazarus]]'s famous poem ''[[The New Colossus]]'' (1883), which celebrated the statue as a symbol of American democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/destinationamerica/usim_qz1b.html|title=Take the Quiz|date=September 2005|work=Destination America|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\nZangwill concludes his play by wishing, \"Peace, peace, to all ye unborn millions, fated to fill this giant continent\u2014the God of our children give you Peace.\" Expressing his hope that through this forging process the \"unborn millions\" who would become America's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity.\n\n==United States==\nIn terms of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the United States]], the \"melting pot\" process has been equated with [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]], that is, [[cultural assimilation]] and [[acculturation]]. The \"melting pot\" metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of [[ethnicities]], yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage. Thus African-Americans are fully culturally integrated into American culture and institutions. Yet more than a century after the abolition of slavery, intermarriage between African-Americans and other ethnicities is much less common than between different white ethnicities, or between white and Asian ethnicities. Intermarriage between whites and non-whites, and especially African-Americans, was a taboo in the United States for a long time, and was illegal in many US states (see [[anti-miscegenation laws]]) until 1967.<ref name=\"Hollinger\">{{cite journal|last=Hollinger|first=David A.|date=December 2003|title=Amalgamation and Hypodescent: The Question of Ethnoracial Mixture in the History of the United States|journal=The American Historical Review|publisher=Indiana University|volume=108|issue=5|pages=1363\u201390|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/108.5/hollinger.html|accessdate=2008-07-15|doi=10.1086/529971|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802031739/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/108.5/hollinger.html|archivedate=2012-08-02}}</ref>\n\n===Whiteness and the melting pot in the United States===\nThe melting pot theory of ethnic relations, which sees American identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups, has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of [[whiteness studies]]. This discipline examines the \"[[social construction]] of whiteness\" and highlights the changing ways in which whiteness has been normative to American national identity from the 17th to the 20th century.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European [[immigration]] to the United States became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers. Beginning in the 1890s, large numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups such as the [[Italian Americans|Italians]], [[American Jew|Jews]], and [[Polish Americans|Poles]] arrived. Many returned to Europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot, adopting American lifestyles.<ref>[[Thomas J. Archdeacon]], ''Becoming American'' (1984) pp. 112\u201325</ref> By contrast, Chinese arrivals met intense hostility and  [[Chinese Exclusion Act|new laws in the 1880s]] tried to exclude them, but many arrived illegally. Hostility forced them into \"Chinatowns\" or ethnic enclaves in the larger cities, where they lived a culture apart and seldom assimilated. The acquisition of Hawaii in 1898, with full citizenship for the residents of all races, greatly increased the Asian American population.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation or the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: \"Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like [[Henry Ford]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]], or was the idea instead that everyone, ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendants and Sicilians, [[Ashkenazi]] and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?\"<ref name=\"Hollinger\" />\n\n[[Nativists]] wanted to severely restrict access to the melting pot. They felt that far too many \"undesirables,\" or in their view, culturally inferior immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe had already arrived. The compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small, and, apart from family reunification, the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time.<ref>Higham (1955) {{page needed|date=October 2018}}</ref> National quotas were established that discouraged immigration from Poland, Italy and Russia, and encouraged immigration from Britain, Ireland and Germany.\n\n====Native Americans====\nIntermarriage between Euro-American men and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women has been common since colonial days. In the 21st century some 7.5 million Americans claim Native American ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|author=C.

In many states, marriage between whites and non-whites was even prohibited by [[state law]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]]. As a result, two kinds of \"mixture talk\" developed:\n\n{{quote|\nAs the new word\u2014miscegenation\u2014became associated with black-white mixing, a preoccupation of the years after the Civil War, the residual European immigrant aspect of the question of [ethnoracial mixture] came to be more than ever a thing apart, discussed all the more easily without any reference to the African-American aspect of the question. This separation of mixture talk into two discourses facilitated, and was in turn reinforced by, the process [[Matthew Frye Jacobson]] has detailed whereby European immigrant groups became less ambiguously white and more definitely \"not black\".<ref name=\"Hollinger\" />}}\n\nBy the early 21st century, many white Americans celebrated the impact of African-American culture, especially in sports and music. Marriages between white Americans and African-Americans were still problematic in both communities. Israel Zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century: \"However scrupulously and justifiably America avoids intermarriage with the negro, the comic spirit cannot fail to note spiritual miscegenation which, while clothing, commercializing, and Christianizing the ex-African, has given '[[rag-time]]' and the sex-dances that go with it, first to white America and then to the whole white world.\"<ref name=\"Rogin\">{{cite journal|last=Rogin|first=Michael|date=December 1992|title=Making America Home: Racial Masquerade and Ethnic Assimilation in the Transition to Talking Pictures|journal=The Journal of American History|publisher=Organization of American Historians|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1050\u201377|accessdate=2011-05-14|doi=10.2307/2080798|jstor=2080798|url=http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4455.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807164904/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4455.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Multiracial influences on culture===\nWhite Americans long regarded some elements of [[African-American culture]] quintessentially \"American\", while at the same time treating African Americans as second-class citizens. White appropriation, stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which European immigrants could express themselves as Americans, through such traditions as [[blackface]], [[minstrel show]]s and later in [[jazz]] and in early Hollywood cinema, notably in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927).<ref name=\"Rogin\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the \"racial masquerade\" that was involved in creation of a white \"melting pot\" culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century, historian Michael Rogin has commented: \"Repudiating 1920s nativism, these films [Rogin discusses ''The Jazz Singer'', ''[[Old San Francisco]]'' (1927), ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]]'' (1930), ''[[King of Jazz]]'' (1930) celebrate the melting pot. Unlike other racially stigmatized groups, white immigrants can put on and take off their mask of difference. But the freedom promised immigrants to make themselves over points to the vacancy, the violence, the deception, and the melancholy at the core of American self-fashioning\".<ref name=\"Rogin\"/>\n\nSince World War II, the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the United States, gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites.\n\n====Ethnicity in films====\nThis trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of World War II, starting with [[Bataan (film)|''Bataan'']] (1943). This film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between Americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial American unit. At the time blacks and Japanese in the armed forces were still segregated, while Chinese and Indians were in integrated units.\n\nHistorian [[Richard Slotkin]] sees ''Bataan'' and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the \"melting pot platoon\", a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s \"an American community that did not yet exist\", and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation. However, Slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the Japanese enemy: \"the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred...The final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of 'dirty monkeys.'\" He sees this racist rage as an expression of \"the unresolved tension between racialism and civic egalitarianism in American life\".<ref name=\"Slotkin\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/alh/13.3.469|last=Slotkin|first=Richard |date=Fall 2001|title=Unit Pride: Ethnic Platoons and the Myths of American Nationality|journal=American Literary History|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|volume=13|issue=9|pages=469\u201398|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/american_literary_history/v013/13.3slotkin.html|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\n====Hawaii====\nIn Hawaii, as Rohrer (2008) argues, there are two dominant discourses of racial politics, both focused on \"[[haole]]\" (white people or whiteness in Hawaii) in the islands. The first is the discourse of racial harmony representing Hawaii as an idyllic racial paradise with no conflict or inequality. There is also a competing discourse of discrimination against nonlocals, which contends that \"haoles\" and nonlocal people of color are disrespected and treated unfairly in Hawaii. As negative referents for each other, these discourses work to reinforce one another and are historically linked. Rohrer proposes that the question of racial politics be reframed toward consideration of the processes of racialization themselves\u2014toward a new way of thinking about racial politics in Hawaii that breaks free of the not racist/racist dyad.<ref>Judy Rohrer, \"Disrupting the 'Melting Pot': Racial Discourse in Hawai'i and the Naturalization of Haole.\" ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' 2008 31(6): 1110\u201325</ref>\n\n====Olympics====\nThroughout the history of the modern Olympic Games, the theme of the United States as a melting pot has been employed to explain American athletic success, becoming an important aspect of national self-image. The diversity of American athletes in the Olympic Games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid-a massive influx of immigrants, as well as American Indians (represented by [[Jim Thorpe]] in 1912) and blacks (represented by [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936). In the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], two black American athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the U.S. national anthem with [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|a \"Black Power\" salute]] that symbolized rejection of assimilation.<ref>Henry Louis Gates and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham (2004). ''African American lives''. p. 5 {{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nThe international aspect of the games allowed the United States to define its pluralistic self-image against the monolithic traditions of other nations. American athletes served as cultural ambassadors of [[American exceptionalism]], promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of America as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture. Journalists and other American analysts of the Olympics framed their comments with patriotic nationalism, stressing that the success of U.S. athletes, especially in the high-profile track-and-field events, stemmed not from simple athletic prowess but from the superiority of the civilization that spawned them.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]] strongly revived the melting pot image, returning to a bedrock form of American nationalism and patriotism. The reemergence of Olympic melting pot discourse was driven especially by the unprecedented success of [[African Americans]], [[Mexican Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], and [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] in events traditionally associated with Europeans and white North Americans such as speed skating and the bobsled.<ref>Mark Dyerson, \"'America's Athletic Missionaries': Political Performance, Olympic Spectacle and the Quest for an American National Culture, 1896\u20131912,\" ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(2): 185\u2013203; Dyerson, \"Return to the Melting Pot: An Old American Olympic Story,\"  ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(2): 204\u201323</ref> The 2002 Winter Olympics was also a showcase of American religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of Utah's large majority population of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], as well representation of [[Muslim Americans]] and other religious groups in the U.S. Olympic team.<ref>Ethan R.

The concept of cultural pluralism first emerged in the 1910s and 1920s among intellectual circles out of the debates in the United States over how to approach issues of immigration and national identity.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe [[First World War]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] caused a \"[[Red Scare]]\" in the US, which also fanned feelings of [[xenophobia]]. During and immediately after the First World War, the concept of the melting pot was equated by [[Nativists]] with complete cultural assimilation towards an Anglo-American norm (\"Anglo-conformity\") on the part of immigrants, and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the United States.\n\nThe newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with \"Americanization\", meaning cultural assimilation, by many \"old stock\" Americans. In [[Henry Ford]]'s Ford English School (established in 1914), the graduation ceremony for immigrant employees involved symbolically stepping off an immigrant ship and passing through ''the melting pot'', entering at one end in costumes designating their nationality and emerging at the other end in identical suits and waving American flags.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/FordEnglishSchool.htm|title=Ford English School|work=Automobile in American Life and Society|publisher=University of Michigan |location=Dearborn|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/UFRLCE/DepAnglais/cours/civi/immigration.html|title=Immigration|publisher=University of Nancy|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to the absorption of millions of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was especially strong among popular writers such as [[Madison Grant]] and [[Lothrop Stoddard]], who believed in the \"racial\" superiority of Americans of Northern European descent as member of the \"[[Nordicism|Nordic race]]\", and therefore demanded immigration restrictions to stop a \"degeneration\" of America's white racial \"stock\". They believed that complete cultural assimilation of the immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was not a solution to the problem of immigration because intermarriage with these immigrants would endanger the [[racial purity]] of Anglo-America. The controversy over immigration faded away after immigration restrictions were put in place with the enactment of the [[Johnson-Reed Act]] in 1924.\n\nIn response to the pressure exerted on immigrants to culturally assimilate and also as a reaction against the denigration of the culture of non-Anglo white immigrants by Nativists, intellectuals on the left, such as [[Horace Kallen]] in ''Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot'' (1915), and [[Randolph Bourne]] in ''Trans-National America'' (1916), laid the foundations for the concept of [[cultural pluralism]]. This term was coined by Kallen.<ref>Noam Pianko, \"'The True Liberalism of Zionism': Horace Kallen, Jewish Nationalism, and the Limits of American Pluralism,\" ''American Jewish History,'' December 2008, Vol. 94, Issue 4, pp. 299\u2013329,</ref> Randolph Bourne, who objected to Kallen's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference, envisioned a \"trans-national\" and [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] America. The concept of cultural pluralism was popularized in the 1940s by [[John Dewey]].\n\nIn the United States, where the term melting pot is still commonly used, the ideas of [[cultural pluralism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have, in some circles, taken precedence over the idea of assimilation.<ref name=\"Miton\">{{cite book |last=Milton |first=Gordon |title=Assimilation in American Life |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1964 |isbn=0195008960 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/assimilationinam0000gord }}</ref><ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\">{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  |author2=Strother-Adams, Pearlie | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co | location =Chicago | isbn = 078728145X}}</ref><ref name=\"Glazer\">{{cite book|last=Glazer|first=Nathan|author2=Moynihan, Daniel P.|title=Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York City|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|year=1970|edition=2nd|isbn=026257022X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondmeltingpot0000glaz}}</ref> Alternate models where immigrants retain their native cultures such as the \"salad bowl\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsavvy.com/understanding_american_culture.htm|title=Understanding American Culture: From Melting Pot to Salad Bowl|last=Millet|first=Joyce |publisher=Cultural Savvy|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> or the \"symphony\"<ref name=\"Miton\" /> are more often used by sociologists to describe how cultures and ethnicities mix in the United States. Nonetheless, the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt, such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language.\n\nSince the 1960s, much research in Sociology and History has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the United States and other counties.<ref name=\"Miton\" /><ref name=\"Dealing with Diversity\" /><ref name=\"Glazer\" /> The theory of [[multiculturalism]] offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including ''[[salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] theory'', or, as it is known in [[Canada]], the ''[[cultural mosaic]]''. In the 1990s, [[political correctness]] in the United States emphasized that each ethnic and national group has the right to maintain and preserve its cultural distinction and integrity, and that one does not need to assimilate or abandon one's heritage in order to blend in or merge into the majority Anglo-American society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nNevertheless, some prominent scholars, such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] in ''[[Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity]]'', have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day United States culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot, assimilation, and Anglo-conformity models. Under this theory, it is asserted that the United States has one of the most homogeneous cultures of any nation in the world. This line of thought holds that this American national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from Britain, Ireland, and Germany. When more recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe brought their various cultures to America at the beginning of the 20th century, they changed the American cultural landscape just very slightly and, for the most part, assimilated into America's pre-existing culture, which had its origins in Northwestern Europe.\n\nThe decision of whether to support a melting-pot or multicultural approach has developed into an issue of much debate within some countries. For example, the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|French]] and British governments and populace are currently debating whether Islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries.<ref name=\"Cowell\">{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/15/news/brits.php|title=Islamic schools at heart of British debate on integration|last=Cowell|first=Alan |date=2006-10-15|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\n==Use in other regions==\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Kroisos BMC 31.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Gold [[croeseid]] of [[Croesus]] c.550 BC, depicting the Lydian lion and Greek bull - partly in recognition of transnational parentage.]]In more ancient times, some marriages between distinctly different tribes and nations were due to royalty trying to form alliances with or to influence other kingdoms or to dissuade marauders or slave traders.

Mexico, beginning with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztecs]], had entered a new global empire based on trade and immigration. In the 16th and 17th centuries, waves of Spanish, and to a lesser extent, African and Filipino culture became embedded into the fabric of Mexican culture. It is important to note, however, that from a Mexican standpoint, the immigrants and their culture were no longer considered foreign, but Mexican in their entirety. The food, art, and even heritage were assimilated into a Mexican identity. Upon the [[independence of Mexico]], Mexico began receiving immigrants from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again, bringing many cultural influences but being quickly labeled as Mexican, unlike in the United States, where other culture is considered foreign. This assimilation is very evident, even in Mexican society today: for example, [[banda music|banda]], a style of music originating in northern Mexico, is simply a Mexican take on Central European music brought by immigrants in the 18th century. Mexico's thriving beer industry was also the result of German brewers finding refuge in Mexico. Many famous Mexicans are actually of Arab descent; [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Carlos Slim]]. The coastal states of [[Guerrero]] and [[Veracruz]] are inhabited by citizens of African descent. Mexico's national policy is based on the concept of [[mestizaje]], a word meaning \"to mix\". The immigrants are socially under pressure to adopt a Mexican nationality and become part of the broader culture (speaking Spanish, respect the Catholic heritage, help the society), while contributing useful cultural traits foreign to Mexican society.\n\n===South America===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}\n\n====Argentina====\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as [[Demography of Canada|Canada]], [[Demography of Australia|Australia]], the [[Demography of the United States|United States]], [[Demography of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Demography of New Zealand|New Zealand]],  [[Demographics of the United Arab Emirates|The United Arab Emirates]], and [[Demographics of Singapore|Singapore]], Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669 |title=About Argentina |publisher=Government of Argentina |accessdate=2009-09-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919230812/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1669 |archivedate=2009-09-19 }}</ref> When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of newer settlement like Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand;<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 June 2007|accessdate=22 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite web|url=http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf |title=European Immigration into South America, 1870\u20131930 |last=S\u00e1nchez-Alonso |first=Blanca |publisher=Universidad San Pablo-CEU |location=Madrid |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf |archivedate=August 14, 2011 }}</ref> and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the [[immigration to Argentina]] becomes evident.\n\nMost Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers and of the 19th- and 20th-century [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|immigrants from Europe]].

However, Brazilian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. Brazilians of mainly European descent (Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Austrian, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, etc.) account for more than half the population, although people of mixed ethnic backgrounds form an increasingly larger segment; roughly two-fifths of the total are mulattoes (''mulattos''; people of mixed African and European ancestry) and mestizos (''mesti\u00e7os'', or ''caboclos''; people of mixed European and Indian ancestry). Portuguese are the main European ethnic group in Brazil, and most Brazilians can trace their ancestry to an [[Portuguese people|ethnic Portuguese]] or a mixed-race Portuguese. Among European descendants, Brazil has the largest [[Italian-Brazilian|Italian diaspora]], the second largest [[German-Brazilian|German diaspora]], as well as other European groups.

No official figures were available, since the Colombian government dropped any references to race in the census after 1918, but according to rough estimates in the late 1980s, mestizos (white and Native American mix) constituted approximately 50% of the population, whites (predominantly Spanish origin, Italian, German, French, etc.) made a 25%, mulattoes (black-white mix) 14% and zambos  (black and Native American mix) 4%, blacks (pure or predominantly of African origin) 3% percent, and Native Americans 1%.\n\n====Costa Rica====\n[[Costa Rica]]n people is a very syncretic melting pot, because this country has been constituted in percentage since the 16th century by immigrants from all the European countries\u2014mostly [[Spaniards]] and [[Italians]] with a lot of [[Germans]], [[british people|British]], [[Swedes]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[french people|French]] and [[Croats]]\u2014also as [[black people]] from Africa and Jamaica, [[Americans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Latin Americans]] who have mestized over time with the large native populations (criollos, castizos, mulattos, blacks and tri-racial) creating the national average modern ethnic composition.<ref>{{cite web|last1=D'Onofrio|first1=S|last2=Campos|first2=A|last3=Guill\u00e9n|first3=F|title=Multiculturalidad en Costa Rica: los inmigrantes y sus descendientes|url=https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4301/35136576774_fbbeee0cee_o.jpg|publisher=Sicultura|language= Spanish|accessdate=6 January 2018|format=JPG|date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nNowadays a great part of the Costa Rican inhabitants are considered white (84%), with minority groups of mulatto (7%), indigenous (2%), Chinese (2%) and black (1%). Also, over 9% of the total population is foreign-born (specially from [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]] and the [[United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=The World Factbook \u2013 Costa Rica: People and Society|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nThe [[Indian subcontinent]] has a long history of inter-ethnic marriage dating back to [[ancient India]]. Various groups of people have been intermarrying for millennia in the Indian subcontinent, including speakers of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] languages. On account of such diverse influences, the Indian subcontinent in a nut-shell appears to be a cradle of human civilization. Despite invasions in its recent history it has succeeded in organically assimilating incoming influences, blunting their wills for imperialistic hegemony and maintaining its strong roots and culture. These invasions, however, brought their own racial mixing between diverse populations and the Indian subcontinent is considered an exemplary \"melting pot\" (and not a \"salad bowl\") by many geneticists for exactly this reason. However, society in the Indian subcontinent has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. Ethnic conflicts in [[Pakistan]] between [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], [[Punjabis]], and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s, are other impediments to the melting pot thesis.\n\n===Afghanistan===\nAfghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot, as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of Afghanistan. The term ''Afghan'' was originally used to refer to the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] in the Middle Ages, and the intention behind the creation of the Afghan state was originally to be a [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun state]], but later this policy changed, leading to the inclusion of non-Pashtuns in the state as Afghans. Today in Afghanistan, the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring, where different Afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new Afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in Afghanistan today, ultimately replacing the old Pashtun identity which stood for Afghan. With the churning growth of [[Persian language|Persian]], many ethnic groups, including de-tribalized Pashtuns, are adopting Dari Persian as their new native tongue. Many ethnic groups in Afghanistan tolerate each other, while the [[Hazara people|Hazara]]\u2013Pashtun conflict was notable, and often claimed as a [[Shia-Sunni relations|Shia-Sunni conflict]] instead of ethnic conflict, as this conflict was carried out by the [[Taliban]]. The Taliban, which are mostly ethnically Pashtun, have spurred Anti-Pashtunism across non-Pashtun Afghans. Pashtun\u2013[[Tajik people|Tajik]] rivalries have lingered about, but are much milder. Reasons for this antipathy are criticism of Tajiks (for either their non-tribal culture or cultural rivalry in Afghanistan) by Pashtuns and criticism of Taliban (mostly composed of Pashtuns) by Tajiks. There have been rivalries between Pashtuns and [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] as well, which is likely very similar to the [[Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010|Kyrgyzstan Crisis]], which Pashtuns would likely take place as [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] (for having a similar nomadic culture), rivaling with Tajiks and Uzbeks (of sedentary culture), despite all being [[Sunni]] Muslims.\n\n===Israel===\n\nIn the early years of the state of [[Israel]], the term ''melting pot'' (\u05db\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05da), also known as \"Ingathering of the Exiles\" (\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea), was not a description of a process, but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the Jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures (see [[Jewish ethnic divisions]]).  This was performed on several levels, such as educating the younger generation (with the parents not having the final say) and (to mention an anecdotal one) encouraging and sometimes forcing the new citizens to adopt a Hebrew name.\n\nActivists such as the Iraq-born [[Ella Shohat]] that an elite which developed in the early 20th century, out of the earlier-arrived Zionist Pioneers of the Second and Third [[Aliyah|Aliyas]] (immigration waves)\u2014and who gained a dominant position in the [[Yishuv]] (pre-state community) since the 1930s\u2014had formulated a new Hebrew culture, based on the values of [[Socialist Zionism]], and imposed it on all later arrivals, at the cost of suppressing and erasing these later immigrants' original culture.\n\nProponents of the Melting Pot policy asserted that it applied to all newcomers to Israel equally; specifically, that [[Eastern European]] Jews were pressured to discard their [[Yiddish]]-based culture as ruthlessly as [[Mizrahi]] Jews were pressured to give up the culture which they developed during centuries of life in Arab and Muslim countries. Critics respond, however, that a cultural change effected by a struggle within the [[Ashkenazi]]-East European community, with younger people voluntarily discarding their ancestral culture and formulating a new one, is not parallel to the subsequent exporting and imposing of this new culture on others, who had no part in formulating it. Also, it was asserted that extirpating the Yiddish culture had been in itself an act of oppression only compounding what was done to the Mizrahi immigrants.\n\nToday the reaction to this doctrine is ambivalent; some say that it was a necessary measure in the founding years, while others claim that it amounted to cultural [[oppression]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Liphshiz|first=Cnaan|title=Melting pot' approach in the army was a mistake, says IDF absorption head|url=http://www.haaretz.com/melting-pot-approach-in-the-army-was-a-mistake-says-idf-absorption-head-1.245477|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> Others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target: for example, the persons born in Israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population.<ref>Yitzhaki, Shlomo and [[Schechtman, Edna]] ''The \"Melting Pot\": A Success Story?''

Though the majority of [[Russians]] had [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-speaking ancestry, different ethnicities were assimilated into the Russian melting pot through the period of expansion. [[cultural assimilation|Assimilation]] was a way for ethnic minorities to advance their standing within the Russian society and state\u2014as individuals or groups. It required adoption of Russian as a day-to-day language and [[Orthodox Christianity]] as religion of choice. The Roman Catholics (as in Poland and Lithuania) generally resisted assimilation. Throughout the centuries of eastward expansion of Russia  [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] and [[Turkic peoples]] were assimilated and included into the emerging Russian nation. This includes [[Mordvin]], [[Udmurt people|Udmurt]], [[Mari people|Mari]], [[Tatar]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Bashkir people|Bashkir]], and others. Surnames of many of Russia's nobility (including [[Suvorov]], [[Kutuzov]], [[Yusupov]], etc.) suggest their Turkic origin.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Groups of later, 18th- and 19th-century migrants to Russia, from [[Europe]] ([[Germans]], [[French people|French]], [[Italians]], [[Poles]], [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], etc.) or the [[Caucasus]] ([[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Ossetians]], [[Chechens]], [[Azeris]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] among them) also assimilated within several generations after settling among Russians in the expanding Russian Empire.<ref>Karen Dawisha and Bruce Parr, eds.

This primarily consisted of the Chinese, Indian and Arab traders. This is also includes neighboring southeast Asian cultures. The cultures and races mixed with indigenous tribes, mainly of Austronesian descent (i.e. the Indonesians, Malays and Brunei) and the [[Negrito]]s. The result was a mix of cultures and ideals. This melting pot of culture continued with the arrival of Europeans, mixing their western culture with the nation. The [[Spanish Empire]] colonized the Philippines for more than three centuries, and during the early 20th century, was conquered and annexed by the United States and occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. In modern times, the Philippines has been the place of many retired Americans, Japanese expatriates and Korean students.

Steven Leckie founded the band, and footage of the band can be found on the official Viletones website. They appeared on the front cover of magazines all over the world, including Steven Leckie on the front cover of Record Week and Fanfare.\n\nFrom July 7\u201310, 1977 the group joined [[The Diodes]] and [[Teenage Head (band)|Teenage Head]] at famed New York punk club [[CBGB]] at a showcase featuring \"three outrageous punk bands from Toronto, Canada\".  Eminent rock critic [[Lester Bangs]] described the show in an April 29, 1981 article for the ''[[Village Voice]]'': \"This guy Nazi Dog hung from the rafters, crawled all over the stage, and hurled himself on the first row until his body was one huge sore.\" {{Cite quote|date=March 2012}}.

The same year Pompeii, Hate and X abruptly left The Viletones to form [[The Secrets (Punk Band)]]. That year, the new lineup of the Viletones appeared at the concert ''[[The Last Pogo]]'', filmed at the Horseshoe Tavern in [[Toronto]] May 1, 1978, and became a feature film [[documentary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209094/|title=The Last Pogo|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> which was followed by a [[sequel]] in 2013.\n\nAt the Rock Against Radiation concert in Nathan Phillips Square, Toronto, on July 19, 1980, The Viletones shared a bill with DOA, Stark Naked and The Fleshtones, Forgotten Rebels and Joe College and The Rulers.\n\nIn 1983, The Viletones released their first full-length [[album]], ''Saturday Night/Sunday Morning'', recorded live at [[Larry's Hideaway]] in Toronto.  Later that decade, they released a [[United States|U.S.]]-only release, ''Live At Max's''. In 1994, a [[record label]], Other Peoples Music, released a retrospective, ''A Taste Of Honey''. In 1997, Leckie released the ''What It Feels Like To Kill'' album. Steven Leckie also ran art gallery in Toronto called Fleurs Du Mal, notable patrons included [[The Sex Pistols]] manager [[Malcolm McLaren]]. Leckie discovered and mentored various young artists whom later went on to be auctioned at Waddington's and Ritchie's. Steven Leckie also made a brief appearance in the film, ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''.\n\nA reference to their song, \"Screamin Fist\", turned up in the pages of ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a novel by [[William Gibson]], and a [[computer virus]] was also named after the song.\n\nOther members of the Viletones include Screamin' Sam Ferrara/bass, Tony Vincent/drums, Steve Koch/guitar, Steven Stergiu/guitar, Conrad Wiggins/guitar, Ian Blurton/guitar, Scott McCullough/guitar, Jeff Zurba/drums, Steve Scarlet/guitar.\n\nThe last official sworn in member historically of Viletones, was Steven Stergiu.  He holds the unique distinction of playing  with Leckie, Tony Vincent, Conrad Wiggins, Ronnie Azzapardi (Handsome Ned, and Viletone regular when filling in for Sam Ferrara,  aka Screaming Sam). Stergiu replaced Steve Koch (Viletones, Demics, Handsome Ned). After a highly successful & critically acclaimed reunion with this line up, Viletones released their first commercial music video, which received regular rotation on Much Music, MTV (America & Europe) and some coverage on the BBC. The first comeback show with this lineup was recorded live by the famous Doug McClement and was released officially soon after. It featured live material and 3 new tracks written by Leckie/Stergiu and was their first new material since early eighties. This release was called \"What It Feels Like To Kill\" Leckie and Stergiu then relocated to London and formed a British version of the band.\n\nThe Viletones most recent performance was on Aug.15, 2015, despite Steven Leckie's battle with [[Multiple sclerosis|MS]], and was filmed in 3-D by Regg Hartt for Cineforum.<ref>http://reghartt.ca/cineforum/?p=22270 Bands Filmed by Regg Hartt</ref>\n\nSteven Leckie has also performed as a [[spoken word]] artist, reading from his yet unpublished [[autobiography]] tentatively titled \"Screamin Fist', and has appeared on various panels and discussion groups on the subject of [[addiction]] and  [[Addiction recovery groups|recovery]].\n\nIn November 2012, Steven Leckie posted an obituary for original drummer Mike \"Motor X\" Andersen on his [[Facebook]] page which was featured in [[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]:\n\n\"My Deepest Sympathies To Motor's Loved Ones.

Other members from the original line-up were Freddie Pompeii, (some sources list him as 'Frederick DiPasquale') on [[guitar]]/vocals; Chris Hate (Chris Paputts), on [[bass guitar]]/vocals and Mike Anderson, b.1955 - d.2012 on the [[drums]]/vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/viletones-p207017|title=Viletones - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref>  The original line-up was active 1976-1977, and thereafter featured Steven Leckie as the only original member with various backing musicians.\n\n==Career==\nThe Viletones are one of the first generation punk rock bands from Toronto, Canada. Steven Leckie founded the band, and footage of the band can be found on the official Viletones website. They appeared on the front cover of magazines all over the world, including Steven Leckie on the front cover of Record Week and Fanfare.\n\nFrom July 7\u201310, 1977 the group joined [[The Diodes]] and [[Teenage Head (band)|Teenage Head]] at famed New York punk club [[CBGB]] at a showcase featuring \"three outrageous punk bands from Toronto, Canada\".  Eminent rock critic [[Lester Bangs]] described the show in an April 29, 1981 article for the ''[[Village Voice]]'': \"This guy Nazi Dog hung from the rafters, crawled all over the stage, and hurled himself on the first row until his body was one huge sore.\" {{Cite quote|date=March 2012}}. The concert was spoofed in an early episode of the television comedy show [[Second City Television|SCTV]], where comedian [[Rick Moranis]] as newscaster [[David Brinkley]], looking a little rough, reviews a Viletones concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sctvguide.ca/programs/brinkley.htm|title=SCTV Guide - Programs - Comment|website=www.sctvguide.ca}}</ref>\n\nAlso that year, The Viletones released their first [[single (music)|single]], \"Screamin Fist\" b/w \"Possibilities\" and \"Rebel\" on their own label Vile Records.<ref>{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Panontin | title = The Viletones - Screamin' Fist EP - 7\" Review | url = http://www.canuckistanmusic.com/index.php?maid=157 | publisher = Canuckistan Music | accessdate = February 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, they released ''Look Back In Anger'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622053339/http://www.btinternet.com/~thisispunkrock/ps/can/viletones.jpg|title=Wayback Machine|date=22 June 2006|publisher=}}</ref> which featured the songs \"Don't You Lie\" and \"Dirty Feeling\", b/w \"Back Door To Hell\", \"Swastika Girl\" and \"Danger Boy\". The same year Pompeii, Hate and X abruptly left The Viletones to form [[The Secrets (Punk Band)]]. That year, the new lineup of the Viletones appeared at the concert ''[[The Last Pogo]]'', filmed at the Horseshoe Tavern in [[Toronto]] May 1, 1978, and became a feature film [[documentary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209094/|title=The Last Pogo|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> which was followed by a [[sequel]] in 2013.\n\nAt the Rock Against Radiation concert in Nathan Phillips Square, Toronto, on July 19, 1980, The Viletones shared a bill with DOA, Stark Naked and The Fleshtones, Forgotten Rebels and Joe College and The Rulers.\n\nIn 1983, The Viletones released their first full-length [[album]], ''Saturday Night/Sunday Morning'', recorded live at [[Larry's Hideaway]] in Toronto.  Later that decade, they released a [[United States|U.S.]]-only release, ''Live At Max's''. In 1994, a [[record label]], Other Peoples Music, released a retrospective, ''A Taste Of Honey''. In 1997, Leckie released the ''What It Feels Like To Kill'' album. Steven Leckie also ran art gallery in Toronto called Fleurs Du Mal, notable patrons included [[The Sex Pistols]] manager [[Malcolm McLaren]]. Leckie discovered and mentored various young artists whom later went on to be auctioned at Waddington's and Ritchie's. Steven Leckie also made a brief appearance in the film, ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''.\n\nA reference to their song, \"Screamin Fist\", turned up in the pages of ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a novel by [[William Gibson]], and a [[computer virus]] was also named after the song.\n\nOther members of the Viletones include Screamin' Sam Ferrara/bass, Tony Vincent/drums, Steve Koch/guitar, Steven Stergiu/guitar, Conrad Wiggins/guitar, Ian Blurton/guitar, Scott McCullough/guitar, Jeff Zurba/drums, Steve Scarlet/guitar.\n\nThe last official sworn in member historically of Viletones, was Steven Stergiu.  He holds the unique distinction of playing  with Leckie, Tony Vincent, Conrad Wiggins, Ronnie Azzapardi (Handsome Ned, and Viletone regular when filling in for Sam Ferrara,  aka Screaming Sam). Stergiu replaced Steve Koch (Viletones, Demics, Handsome Ned). After a highly successful & critically acclaimed reunion with this line up, Viletones released their first commercial music video, which received regular rotation on Much Music, MTV (America & Europe) and some coverage on the BBC. The first comeback show with this lineup was recorded live by the famous Doug McClement and was released officially soon after. It featured live material and 3 new tracks written by Leckie/Stergiu and was their first new material since early eighties. This release was called \"What It Feels Like To Kill\" Leckie and Stergiu then relocated to London and formed a British version of the band.\n\nThe Viletones most recent performance was on Aug.15, 2015, despite Steven Leckie's battle with [[Multiple sclerosis|MS]], and was filmed in 3-D by Regg Hartt for Cineforum.<ref>http://reghartt.ca/cineforum/?p=22270 Bands Filmed by Regg Hartt</ref>\n\nSteven Leckie has also performed as a [[spoken word]] artist, reading from his yet unpublished [[autobiography]] tentatively titled \"Screamin Fist', and has appeared on various panels and discussion groups on the subject of [[addiction]] and  [[Addiction recovery groups|recovery]].\n\nIn November 2012, Steven Leckie posted an obituary for original drummer Mike \"Motor X\" Andersen on his [[Facebook]] page which was featured in [[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]:\n\n\"My Deepest Sympathies To Motor's Loved Ones. Truly Impossible To Express The Power Of His Riff In Screaming Fist, And The VILETONES Period, When We Entered The Music Landscape In 77, It Felt Like We Were As Joe Pesci In \"Casino\", When He Arrives Uninvited And Simply Informs The Status Quo, That VILETONES Are The New Gangsters In Town.

After other party leaders endorsed Netanyahu, Livni led Hatnuah in being the first of several parties to agree to join a new coalition under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], forming the [[thirty-third government of Israel]]. According to the coalition agreement negotiated between Hatnuah and Likud, Livni was appointed [[Justice Ministry (Israel)|justice minister]], as well as chief negotiator with the Palestinian Authority. As environmental issues constituted a central plank in Hatnuah's platform, Livni required her party be given the environmental protection ministry, to which she appointed Amir Peretz. Fulfilling her constitutional duty as Justice Minister, Livni served as chairwoman of the powerful Ministerial Committee on Legislation. Given her clout and experience with Western leaders, Netanyahu unofficially charged Livni with overseeing Israel's [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with the United States and Europe, with Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Liberman]] playing a lesser role.\n\n===2013\u201314 Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace talks===\n[[File:Secretary Kerry, Israeli Justice Minister Livni, and Palestinian Chief Negotiator Erekat Address Reporters (Pic 3).jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Livni, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], and Palestinian negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]] announce the resumption of peace talks]]\nLivni led the Israeli negotiation team in the [[2013\u201314 Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace talks|peace talks]], brokered by U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] and Middle East envoy [[Martin Indyk]] from July 2013 until April 2014. Upon announcing the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians at a press conference delivered at the U.S. State Department, Livni criticized the \"cynicism and pessimism\" surrounding Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and expressed hope that the negotiators would do everything in their power to transform a \"spark of hope into something real and lasting.\" In concluding remarks praised for their poignancy, she said, \"I believe that history is not made by cynics.

An ''ideal'' diffuse reflecting surface is said to exhibit [[Lambertian reflection]], meaning that there is equal [[luminance]] when viewed from all directions lying in the [[half-space (geometry)|half-space]] adjacent to the surface.\n\nA surface built from a non-absorbing powder such as [[plaster]], or from fibers such as paper, or from a [[polycrystalline]] material such as white [[marble]], reflects light diffusely with great efficiency. Many common materials exhibit a mixture of specular and diffuse reflection.\n\nThe visibility of objects, excluding light-emitting ones, is primarily caused by diffuse reflection of light: it is diffusely-scattered light that forms the image of the object in the observer's eye.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Diffuse reflection.gif|thumb|right|Figure&nbsp;1&nbsp;\u2013 General mechanism of diffuse reflection by a solid surface ([[refraction]] phenomena not represented)|250px]]\n[[File:Diffuse reflection.svg|thumb|Figure&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u2013 Diffuse reflection from an irregular surface|250px]]\n\nDiffuse reflection from solids is generally not due to surface roughness.

Mineral materials are generally [[polycrystalline]]: one can describe them as made of a 3D mosaic of small, irregularly shaped defective crystals. Organic materials are usually composed of fibers or cells, with their membranes and their complex internal structure. And each interface, inhomogeneity or imperfection can deviate, reflect or scatter light, reproducing the above mechanism.\n\nFew materials do not cause diffuse reflection: among these are metals, which do not allow light to enter; gases, liquids, glass, and transparent plastics (which have a liquid-like [[amorphous]] microscopic structure); [[Monocrystal|single crystals]], such as some gems or a salt crystal; and some very special materials, such as the tissues which make the [[cornea]] and the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] of an eye. These materials can reflect diffusely, however, if their surface is microscopically rough, like in a [[frost glass]] (Figure&nbsp;2), or, of course, if their homogeneous structure deteriorates, as in [[cataract]]s of the eye lens.\n\nA surface may also exhibit both specular and diffuse reflection, as is the case, for example, of [[glossy]] [[paint]]s as used in home painting, which give also a fraction of specular reflection, while [[matte (surface)|matte]] paints give almost exclusively diffuse reflection.\n\nMost materials can give some specular reflection, provided that their surface can be polished to eliminate irregularities comparable with the light wavelength (a fraction of a micrometer). Depending on the material and surface roughness, reflection may be mostly specular, mostly diffuse, or anywhere in between. A few materials, like liquids and glasses, lack the internal subdivisions which produce the subsurface scattering mechanism described above, and so give ''only'' specular reflection. Among common materials, only polished metals can reflect light specularly with high efficiency, as in aluminum or silver usually used in mirrors. All other common materials, even when perfectly polished, usually give not more than a few percent specular reflection, except in particular cases, such as [[Angle of incidence (optics)#Grazing angle|grazing angle]] reflection by a lake, or the ''[[total reflection]]'' of a glass prism, or when structured in certain complex configurations such as the silvery skin of many fish species or the reflective surface of a [[dielectric mirror]]. Diffuse reflection can be highly efficient, as in white materials, due to the summing up of the many subsurface reflections.\n\n==Colored objects==\nUp to this point white objects have been discussed, which do not absorb light. But the above scheme continues to be valid in the case that the material is absorbent. In this case, diffused rays will lose some wavelengths during their walk in the material, and will emerge colored.\n\nDiffusion affects the color of objects in a substantial manner because it determines the average path of light in the material, and hence to which extent the various wavelengths are absorbed.<ref>Paul Kubelka, Franz Munk (1931), ''Ein Beitrag zur Optik der Farbanstriche'', Zeits. f.

Its vivid color is only perceived when it is placed on a scattering material (e.g. paper). This is so because light's path through the paper fibers (and through the ink) is only a fraction of millimeter long. However, light from the bottle has crossed several centimeters of ink and has been heavily absorbed, even in its red wavelengths.\n\nAnd, when a colored object has both diffuse and specular reflection, usually only the diffuse component is colored. A cherry reflects diffusely red light, absorbs all other colors and has a specular reflection which is essentially white (if the incident light is white light). This is quite general, because, except for metals, the reflectivity of most materials depends on their [[refractive index]], which varies little with the wavelength (though it is this variation that causes the [[chromatic dispersion]] in a [[Prism (optics)|prism]]), so that all colors are reflected nearly with the same intensity. Reflections from different origin, instead, may be colored: metallic reflections, such as in gold or copper, or [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferential]] reflections: [[iridescence]]s, peacock feathers, butterfly wings, beetle [[elytra]], or the [[antireflection coating]] of a lens.\n\n==Importance for vision==\nLooking at one's surrounding environment, the vast majority of visible objects are seen primarily by diffuse reflection from their surface. This holds with few exceptions, such as glass, reflective liquids, polished or smooth metals, glossy objects, and objects that themselves emit light: the Sun, lamps, and computer screens (which, however, emit ''diffuse'' light). Outdoors it is the same, with perhaps the exception of a transparent water stream or of the iridescent colors of a beetle.
