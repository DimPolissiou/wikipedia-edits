He batted .297 with 15 home runs and 107 RBI in the 2006 season. The Yankees ran away with the AL East division title by mid-September 2006, but were eliminated by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[2006 American League Division Series]].\n\nIn 2006, Abreu led the major leagues in walks (124), pitches per plate appearance (4.45), and number of pitches seen (3,056), and was second in the major leagues in percent of plate appearances that were walks (18.5%),<ref name=\"fangraphs2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2006 |title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2006 \u00bb Batters \u00bb Advanced Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball |publisher=Fangraphs.com |date=October 7, 1992 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016032428/http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2006 |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and led the AL in percentage of pitches taken (66.2), and in walks per plate appearance (.181), third in [[batting average on balls in play]] (.375),<ref name=\"fangraphs2006\"/> eighth in on-base percentage (.424), 18th in stolen bases (30), and 19th in doubles (41).\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Abreu drove in six runs in the first inning of the Yankees' 12\u20134 victory over the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]].

In 2007, Abreu was second in the AL in runs (123), third in pitches per plate appearance (4.38), ninth in games (158) and times on base (258), and tenth in walks (84) and plate appearances (699).\n\nAbreu hit a walk-off double on July 9, 2008. On September 18, Abreu hit 2 home runs and had 6 RBI in a game versus the Chicago White Sox and Javier V\u00e1zquez. He finished the season with a .296 average, 20 home runs, and 100 RBI.

Abreu became the first Angels player to reach those figures in batting average and RBI in one calendar month since [[Tim Salmon]], who hit .390 with 32 RBI in 27 games in July 1997.\n\nOn August 6, Abreu led off the fifth inning with a solo home run off [[Chicago White Sox]] pitcher [[John Danks]], giving him 250 homers in his career. Abreu became one of only six players in major league history to collect 250 home runs, 2,000 hits, 1,000 runs, 1,000 runs batted in, 1,000 walks and 300 stolen bases.

He became the first player in Major League history to hit at least one home run in nine out of ten team games.\n\nHe was voted a starter in the NL outfield for the All-Star Game, finishing second in fan voting, behind [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[Jim Edmonds]].

''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' columnist Bill Conlin called the trade \"the Great Gillick Giveaway\" and declared it \"an unvarnished disaster.\" The Phillies actually improved after the Abreu trade and made a run for the National League wild card, only to be eliminated on the second to last day of the season.\n\nAbreu fit well into the Yankees lineup. He batted .297 with 15 home runs and 107 RBI in the 2006 season. The Yankees ran away with the AL East division title by mid-September 2006, but were eliminated by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[2006 American League Division Series]].\n\nIn 2006, Abreu led the major leagues in walks (124), pitches per plate appearance (4.45), and number of pitches seen (3,056), and was second in the major leagues in percent of plate appearances that were walks (18.5%),<ref name=\"fangraphs2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2006 |title=Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2006 \u00bb Batters \u00bb Advanced Statistics &#124; FanGraphs Baseball |publisher=Fangraphs.com |date=October 7, 1992 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016032428/http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2006 |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and led the AL in percentage of pitches taken (66.2), and in walks per plate appearance (.181), third in [[batting average on balls in play]] (.375),<ref name=\"fangraphs2006\"/> eighth in on-base percentage (.424), 18th in stolen bases (30), and 19th in doubles (41).\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Abreu drove in six runs in the first inning of the Yankees' 12\u20134 victory over the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]].

In 2007, Abreu was second in the AL in runs (123), third in pitches per plate appearance (4.38), ninth in games (158) and times on base (258), and tenth in walks (84) and plate appearances (699).\n\nAbreu hit a walk-off double on July 9, 2008. On September 18, Abreu hit 2 home runs and had 6 RBI in a game versus the Chicago White Sox and Javier V\u00e1zquez. He finished the season with a .296 average, 20 home runs, and 100 RBI.  He had the last stolen base in the original Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008.\n\n===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===\n\n====2009 season====\nOn February 12, 2009, Abreu signed a $5&nbsp;million, one-year deal with the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], and was expected to play [[left field]]. However, after [[Vladimir Guerrero]] was moved to [[designated hitter|DH]] due to injury, Abreu saw more action at his natural position in right field.\n\nAfter struggling early in the season, Abreu hit .380 with 28 RBI in 26 games in July and was named American League player of the month. Abreu became the first Angels player to reach those figures in batting average and RBI in one calendar month since [[Tim Salmon]], who hit .390 with 32 RBI in 27 games in July 1997.\n\nOn August 6, Abreu led off the fifth inning with a solo home run off [[Chicago White Sox]] pitcher [[John Danks]], giving him 250 homers in his career. Abreu became one of only six players in major league history to collect 250 home runs, 2,000 hits, 1,000 runs, 1,000 runs batted in, 1,000 walks and 300 stolen bases.

Its [[Capital (political)|capital]] is [[Talca]]. The region derives its name from the [[Maule River]] which, running westward from the [[Andes]], bisects the region and spans a [[Drainage basin|basin]] of about 20,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The Maule river is of considerable historic interest because, among other reasons, it marked the southern limits of the [[Inca Empire]].\n\n==Geography and ecology==\n{{see also|Maulino forest}}\nThe region covers an area of {{convert|30296|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]]; on the east by the [[Argentina]]; on the north by the [[O'Higgins Region]], and on the south by the [[\u00d1uble Region]]. There are a number of flora and fauna species present in Maule. For example, the [[endangered]] [[Chilean Wine Palm]] (''[[Jubaea chilensis]]'') is found in a very limited distribution that includes the Maule Region.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008)</ref> The limited distribution ''[[Nothofagus allesandri]]'' is also found in the region.<ref>Julian Evans. 2001</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2010}}\nAccording to the 2017 [[census]], the population of the region was 1,033,197. With one third of its population living in [[rural]] areas, Maule has a greater proportion of rural inhabitants than any other region of Chile. Its most populated city is the regional capital, Talca, with 235,000 inhabitants, followed by Curic\u00f3 (120,700) and Linares (127,000). Other important cities are: Constituci\u00f3n (50,914), Parral (47,000), Cauquenes (43,000), Molina (42,000) and San Javier (40,000).\n\n===Population density===\nThe average density of the Maule Region is 34.1 inhabitants per km2, with less dense areas towards the mountains, and dense areas in the [[Chilean Central Valley|central valley]].\n\n===Composition by age and sex===\nAccording to the composition pyramid of the population of the Region, those younger than fifteen years old are becoming greater in number than the adult population.  The annual growth rate of the population of the Maule Region is 1.06%; this comparatively low figure arises from the low birth rate in the Region.  The average life expectancy in the Region is 76.3 years.\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[Forestry]] and [[agriculture]], led by wine grape plantations, are the main economic activities. The Maule region is Chile's leading wine-making region, producing 50% of all the country's fine export wines, and a number of the largest vineyards are located here. Owing to its high concentration of vineyards, the [[Curic\u00f3 valley]], which means \"black water\" in [[Mapudungun]] \u2013 is considered the core of Chile's wine industry. Wine-making is a traditional activity, some vineyards dating back to 1830. The increased wine-growing area is matched by the development of the industry's infrastructure, technology, and equipment.\n\nIn addition to wine, two export-oriented agricultural items have emerged dynamically: fruit, vegetables and flowers.\n\nElectricity, gas and water are the second most important economic activity. The Maule River feeds five hydroelectric power plants, including the Colb\u00fan-Machicura complex.\n\n==Political divisions==\nThe 4 [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]] of the Maule Region are divided into 30 [[Communes of Chile|communes]].\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"align:; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" align=center\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|'''Political and administrative divisions of Maule Region, Chile'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|[[Image:Maule Comunas.png|300px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Thus, the Maule river, the long and wide artery that runs through the region, has been considered Chile's [[literature|literary]] river ''par excellence''. Many novels and short stories have had the river as their main background or protagonist. Several anthologies, author's dictionaries and [[essay]]s have given their account of the cultural wealth of the region.\n\nThe region boasts of many small towns and villages with well-preserved colonial rural architecture, both in the religious as well as the civil fields. The [[Diocese of Talca|Talca]] and [[Diocese of Linares, Chile|Linares]] dioceses (the two Roman  [[Catholic]] [[diocese]]s in the Maule region) have several [[parish church]]es of particular beauty and architectural and historic value.\n\n===27 February 2010 earthquake and aftermath===\n{{Main|2010 Chile earthquake}}\nAt 03:34 [[Time in Chile|local time]] (06:34 [[UTC]]), an 8.8 magnitude [[earthquake]] occurred off the Maule coast approximately {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Curanipe]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} north-northeast of Chile's second largest city, [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=USGS1>{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010tfan.php |title=Magnitude 8.8 \u2013 Offshore Maule, Chile |date=February 27, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316004001/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010tfan.php |archivedate=March 16, 2011 }}</ref> The earthquake lasted nearly four minutes,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010tfan/ |title=USGS Earthquake Details |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301114502/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010tfan/ |archivedate=March 1, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/7329357/Huge-earthquake-hits-Chile.html|title=Huge earthquake hits Chile|last=Patrick Sawer|date=February 27, 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=February 27, 2010}}</ref> severely affected the region through its action and the resultant [[tsunami]].

The region derives its name from the [[Maule River]] which, running westward from the [[Andes]], bisects the region and spans a [[Drainage basin|basin]] of about 20,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The Maule river is of considerable historic interest because, among other reasons, it marked the southern limits of the [[Inca Empire]].\n\n==Geography and ecology==\n{{see also|Maulino forest}}\nThe region covers an area of {{convert|30296|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]]; on the east by the [[Argentina]]; on the north by the [[O'Higgins Region]], and on the south by the [[\u00d1uble Region]]. There are a number of flora and fauna species present in Maule. For example, the [[endangered]] [[Chilean Wine Palm]] (''[[Jubaea chilensis]]'') is found in a very limited distribution that includes the Maule Region.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008)</ref> The limited distribution ''[[Nothofagus allesandri]]'' is also found in the region.<ref>Julian Evans. 2001</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2010}}\nAccording to the 2017 [[census]], the population of the region was 1,033,197. With one third of its population living in [[rural]] areas, Maule has a greater proportion of rural inhabitants than any other region of Chile. Its most populated city is the regional capital, Talca, with 235,000 inhabitants, followed by Curic\u00f3 (120,700) and Linares (127,000). Other important cities are: Constituci\u00f3n (50,914), Parral (47,000), Cauquenes (43,000), Molina (42,000) and San Javier (40,000).\n\n===Population density===\nThe average density of the Maule Region is 34.1 inhabitants per km2, with less dense areas towards the mountains, and dense areas in the [[Chilean Central Valley|central valley]].\n\n===Composition by age and sex===\nAccording to the composition pyramid of the population of the Region, those younger than fifteen years old are becoming greater in number than the adult population.  The annual growth rate of the population of the Maule Region is 1.06%; this comparatively low figure arises from the low birth rate in the Region.  The average life expectancy in the Region is 76.3 years.\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[Forestry]] and [[agriculture]], led by wine grape plantations, are the main economic activities. The Maule region is Chile's leading wine-making region, producing 50% of all the country's fine export wines, and a number of the largest vineyards are located here. Owing to its high concentration of vineyards, the [[Curic\u00f3 valley]], which means \"black water\" in [[Mapudungun]] \u2013 is considered the core of Chile's wine industry. Wine-making is a traditional activity, some vineyards dating back to 1830. The increased wine-growing area is matched by the development of the industry's infrastructure, technology, and equipment.\n\nIn addition to wine, two export-oriented agricultural items have emerged dynamically: fruit, vegetables and flowers.\n\nElectricity, gas and water are the second most important economic activity. The Maule River feeds five hydroelectric power plants, including the Colb\u00fan-Machicura complex.\n\n==Political divisions==\nThe 4 [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]] of the Maule Region are divided into 30 [[Communes of Chile|communes]].\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"align:; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" align=center\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|'''Political and administrative divisions of Maule Region, Chile'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|[[Image:Maule Comunas.png|300px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Thus, the Maule river, the long and wide artery that runs through the region, has been considered Chile's [[literature|literary]] river ''par excellence''. Many novels and short stories have had the river as their main background or protagonist. Several anthologies, author's dictionaries and [[essay]]s have given their account of the cultural wealth of the region.\n\nThe region boasts of many small towns and villages with well-preserved colonial rural architecture, both in the religious as well as the civil fields. The [[Diocese of Talca|Talca]] and [[Diocese of Linares, Chile|Linares]] dioceses (the two Roman  [[Catholic]] [[diocese]]s in the Maule region) have several [[parish church]]es of particular beauty and architectural and historic value.\n\n===27 February 2010 earthquake and aftermath===\n{{Main|2010 Chile earthquake}}\nAt 03:34 [[Time in Chile|local time]] (06:34 [[UTC]]), an 8.8 magnitude [[earthquake]] occurred off the Maule coast approximately {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Curanipe]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} north-northeast of Chile's second largest city, [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=USGS1>{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010tfan.php |title=Magnitude 8.8 \u2013 Offshore Maule, Chile |date=February 27, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316004001/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010tfan.php |archivedate=March 16, 2011 }}</ref> The earthquake lasted nearly four minutes,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010tfan/ |title=USGS Earthquake Details |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301114502/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/us2010tfan/ |archivedate=March 1, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/7329357/Huge-earthquake-hits-Chile.html|title=Huge earthquake hits Chile|last=Patrick Sawer|date=February 27, 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=February 27, 2010}}</ref> severely affected the region through its action and the resultant [[tsunami]].

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Implications  ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Alleged examples ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

This election was held \"to fend off any fight during what could be a difficult election cycle,\" and to allow the prospective incoming speaker to attend leadership meetings in preparation for their new role.  In a caucus meeting, Richard beat out fellow Republican and Budget Committee chair [[Allen Icet]] to be preliminarily named Speaker of the 95th General Assembly.<ref>Rosenbaum, Jason.
