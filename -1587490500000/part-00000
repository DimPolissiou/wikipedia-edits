The Mount Rainier stop was located at the intersection of what is now known as [[Rhode Island Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Rhode Island Avenue]] and 34th Street. It was called the District Line Station. With the stop at Mount Rainier, it was easier to attract developers and prospective buyers because now the city offered easy access to get into and out of Washington.\n\nHouses started to be built near the District Line Station after 1902. The homes on Mount Rainier were considered affordable, ranging from $,2000 to $5,000.\n\nThe business district aggregated around the streetcar station. In addition to the station, there were shops, grocery stores, a barbershop, laundry, and dry good stores. The first post office was established in 1904.\n\nIn 1910, the residents in the area around the streetcar station petitioned the Maryland State Legislature to incorporate Mount Rainier, and the city was incorporated by a charter granted on April 14, 1910.<ref>http://www.bhvfrc.com/History/mrvfd_history.html</ref>\n\nIn January 1912, the Mount Rainier volunteer fire department was created. The fire department was first located in a frame building and later moved to a brick structure located on 34th at Shepherd St.\n\nIn 1913, the Women's Civic League of Mount Rainier formed. In 1923, the first public school of Mount Rainier was constructed, and in the same year, the town hired its first paid police officer because of its growing population.\n\nIn 1929, the town acquired {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land, and in the following year, the Mount Rainier High School opened there.\n\nIn 1939, a new terminal was built at 34th St and Rhode Island Ave. because of a change in streetcar services.\n\nIn the 1940s, Kaywood Garden apartments were constructed along Eastern Ave., raising the population of Mount Rainier.\n\nIn 1952, a library was built. In 1956, a privately operated community pool opened.  n 1958, streetcar services stopped and were replaced by bus service.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the population of the city declined.\n\nToday, a large area of Mount Rainier is considered a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn the present day, Mount Rainier still has many of the charms and attractive features that it had in the early 1900s. Residents of Mount Rainier are served by the Rhode Island Avenue & Brookland - CUA Metro Stations<ref>[http://www.mountrainiermd.org/history/]</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\nMount Rainier has been listed as a historic area due to its history as a primary streetcar suburb of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and the vast number of Sears houses and Craftsman-style homes, many of which have been restored.\n\nThere is a lively arts district in the town, which has made a point to provide affordable housing for artists and to showcase their work. Mount Rainier Day, held in May, is one day in which the entire community opens its doors to the public. The town has become a haven for freelance workers in the world of theater, including scenic designers, artistic directors, lighting designers, and stage directors, several of whom have received the highest DC theater honor, the [[Helen Hayes Award]]. Mount Rainier is home to the alternative folk music duo Emma's Revolution and Joe Brewer, lead singer of the rock band [velvet] / owner of Brewer's Arcade, which is a museum quality private collection featuring vintage 1980s era classic arcade and pinball machines.\n\nGlut, a vegetarian, worker-owned organic [[food cooperative]] has existed since the 1960s and draws people from all over the area.\n\nAccording to some sources,<ref name=\"Mark Opsasnick\">{{cite web|url = http://www.strangemag.com/exorcistpage1.html|title= The Haunted Boy of Cottage City: the Cold Hard Facts behind the Story that Inspired the Exorcist|publisher= Strange Magazine|accessdate = 2010-04-17}}</ref> in 1949 at 33rd Street and Bunker Hill Road in Mount Rainier lived a child (see [[Robbie Mannheim]]) who allegedly became possessed by the devil.

The Mount Rainier stop was located at the intersection of what is now known as [[Rhode Island Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Rhode Island Avenue]] and 34th Street. It was called the District Line Station. With the stop at Mount Rainier, it was easier to attract developers and prospective buyers because now the city offered easy access to get into and out of Washington.\n\nHouses started to be built near the District Line Station after 1902. The homes on Mount Rainier were considered affordable, ranging from $,2000 to $5,000.\n\nThe business district aggregated around the streetcar station. In addition to the station, there were shops, grocery stores, a barber shop, laundry, and dry good stores. The first post office was established in 1904.\n\nIn 1910, the residents in the area around the streetcar station petitioned the Maryland State Legislature to incorporate Mount Rainier, and the city was incorporated by a charter granted on April 14, 1910.<ref>http://www.bhvfrc.com/History/mrvfd_history.html</ref>\n\nIn January 1912, the Mount Rainier volunteer fire department was created. The fire department was first located in a frame building and later moved to a brick structure located on 34th at Shepherd St.\n\nIn 1913, the Women's Civic League of Mount Rainier formed. In 1923, the first public school of Mount Rainier was constructed, and in the same year the town hired its first paid police officer because of its growing population.\n\nIn 1929, the town acquired {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land, and in the following year, the Mount Rainier High School opened there.\n\nIn 1939, a new terminal was built at 34th St, and Rhode Island Ave. because of a change in streetcar services.\n\nIn the 1940s, Kaywood Garden apartments were constructed along Eastern Ave., raising the population of Mount Rainier.\n\nIn 1952, a library was built. In 1956, a privately operated community pool opened.  n 1958, streetcar services stopped and were replaced by bus service.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the population of the city declined.\n\nToday, a large area of Mount Rainier is considered an historic district by the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn the present day, Mount Rainier still has many of the charms and attractive features that it had in the early 1900s. Residents of Mount Rainier are served by the Rhode Island Avenue & Brookland - CUA Metro Stations<ref>[http://www.mountrainiermd.org/history/]</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\nMount Rainier has been listed as an historic area due to its history as a primary streetcar suburb of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and the vast number of Sears houses and Craftsman-style homes, many of which have been restored.\n\nThere is a lively arts district in the town, which has made a point to provide affordable housing for artists and to showcase their work. Mount Rainier Day, held in May, is one day in which the entire community opens its doors to the public. The town has become a haven for freelance workers in the world of theater, including scenic designers, artistic directors, lighting designers, and stage directors, several of whom have received the highest DC theater honor, the [[Helen Hayes Award]]. Mount Rainier is home to the alternative folk music duo Emma's Revolution and Joe Brewer, lead singer of the rock band [velvet] / owner of Brewer's Arcade, which is a museum quality private collection featuring vintage 1980s era classic arcade and pinball machines.\n\nGlut, a vegetarian, worker-owned organic [[food cooperative]] has existed since the 1960s and draws people from all over the area.\n\nAccording to some sources,<ref name=\"Mark Opsasnick\">{{cite web|url = http://www.strangemag.com/exorcistpage1.html|title= The Haunted Boy of Cottage City: the Cold Hard Facts behind the Story that Inspired the Exorcist|publisher= Strange Magazine|accessdate = 2010-04-17}}</ref> in 1949 at 33rd Street and Bunker Hill Road in Mount Rainier lived a child (see [[Robbie Mannheim]]) who allegedly became possessed by the devil.

In 1970, Michaels appeared as attorney Dave Bronstein in an episode of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' called \"Run, Johnny, Run\" (Air date: January 14, 1970); the episode also featured a young [[Christopher Walken]].\n\nIn [[1971 Cincinnati Reds season|1971]], Michaels moved to [[Cincinnati]], where he became the lead announcer for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. In [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|1972]], after the Reds won the [[1972 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] and advanced to the [[1972 World Series|World Series]], Michaels helped to cover the Fall Classic for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC Sports]]; he also was the network's play-by-play man for the [[Ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics|hockey coverage]] at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo, Japan]].\n\nIn [[1973 NFL season|1973]], after NBC announcer [[Bill Enis]] died from a heart attack at the age of 39 two days before he was assigned to call the regular-season NFL finale between the [[1973 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] and [[1973 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], Michaels was brought in to replace Enis in the booth with [[Dave Kocourek]].\n\nIn [[1974 San Francisco Giants season|1974]], Michaels left the Reds for a similar position with the [[San Francisco Giants]], and also covered basketball for [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], replacing [[Dick Enberg]] on the Bruins' tape-delayed telecasts of their home games, during a period when UCLA was in the midst of an 88-game winning streak.

Also, he served as host for the yearly [[Tiger Woods]] [[Monday Night Golf|Monday night specials]] that aired in July or August.\n\n===The Miracle on Ice===\n{{Main|Miracle on Ice}}\nTwo of Michaels's more famous broadcasts were of the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] ice hockey medal round match between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], and the attempted third game of the [[1989 World Series]].\n\nIn 1980, an unheralded group of college ice hockey players from the United States won the Gold Medal at the [[Olympic Winter Games]]. The medal round match on February 22\u2014which, contrary to popular belief, did not yet assure the team of the gold medal\u2014was of particular interest, as it was played against a heavily favored professional squad from the Soviet Union, and was in front of an incredibly excited pro-American crowd in [[Lake Placid, New York]]. Michaels's memorable broadcast of this game, including his interjection\u2014''\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\"''\u2014as time expired on the 4\u20133 U.S. victory, earned the game the media nickname of ''[[Miracle on Ice|The Miracle on Ice]]''.\n\nMost assume that the game was broadcast live (indeed, [[Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium|CTV]], which held Canadian rights to the game, aired it live); but in reality, the game started at 5:05&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] and ABC decided against pre-empting local and network news (on the East Coast) to carry the game live. Instead, most of it\u2014including the entire third period\u2014was broadcast within the regularly scheduled, prime-time telecast from 8:30 to 11&nbsp;pm Eastern time (and on a six-and-a-half-hour delay on the West Coast from 8:30 to 11&nbsp;pm [[Pacific Standard Time]]). Despite being on tape, the game was one of the highest-rated programs of the 1979\u201380 television season and remains the most-watched ice hockey game in the history of American television.<ref name=\"nhl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=519476|title=Olympic final most-watched hockey game in 30 years \u2013 NHL.com \u2013 All-Access Vancouver|publisher=nhl.com|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMichaels, along with broadcasting partner [[Ken Dryden]], recreated their Olympic commentary in the 2004 movie ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]''. Although Michaels and Dryden recreated the bulk of their commentary for the film, the closing seconds of the game against the Soviet Union used the original ABC Sports commentary from 1980. [[Gavin O'Connor (director)|Gavin O'Connor]], the director of ''Miracle'', decided to use the last 10&nbsp;seconds of Michaels's original ''\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\"'' call in the film because he felt he couldn't ask him to recreate the emotion he experienced at that moment. Thus they cleaned up the recording to make the transition to the authentic call as seamless as possible.\n\nMichaels later recalled, \"When I look back, obviously Lake Placid would be the highlight of my career. I can't think of anything that would ever top it. I can't dream up a scenario.\"\n\nMichaels was only on this particular assignment because he had done one hockey game, eight years prior. The game in question was the gold medal game (the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] vs. [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]]) of the [[Ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics|1972 Winter Olympics]] (on [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]) in [[Sapporo]], Japan. Other announcers on the ABC Sports roster such as [[Keith Jackson]], [[Frank Gifford]], and [[Howard Cosell]] had never done a hockey game before. Michaels recalled this during a ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel|Real Sports]]'' interview in January 2009. Michaels also apparently beat out [[WABC-AM]] and [[New York Islanders]] commentator [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] for the assignment.<ref name=\"nbcumv.com\">[http://www.nbcumv.com/sports/release_detail.nbc/sports-20090305000000-034i039vebeen.html]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Syken|first=Bill|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1108840/index.htm|title=He Missed the Call!|work=Sports Illustrated|date=November 15, 2004|volume=101|issue=19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025194127/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1108840/index.htm|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTwo days later, Michaels would broadcast the gold medal game, in which the U.S. defeated Finland, closing the game out by declaring \"This impossible dream comes true!\"\n\nMichaels<ref>{{YouTube|title=92-93 Playoffs Kings goals vs Flames (Round One)|id=9zZJMB_RHsI}}</ref> along with [[John Davidson (hockey player)|John Davidson]] would later call Games 1 and 4 of the [[1992\u201393 Calgary Flames season|Calgary]]\u2013[[1992\u201393 Los Angeles Kings season|Los Angeles]] [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs#.28S2.29 Calgary Flames vs. .28S3.29 Los Angeles Kings|Stanley Cup playoff]] series in 1993 for [[NHL on ABC|ABC]].\n\n===Memorable baseball moments===\n\n====1972 National League Championship Series====\n{{Main|1972 National League Championship Series}}\n\nEven though the events of October 17, 1989, in San Francisco are widely considered to be the most dramatic baseball-related moment of Michaels's career, he had several others that were memorable.\n\nIn the [[1972 National League Championship Series]], the defending World Series Champion [[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] faced the [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]]. In Game 5, with both teams tied at two games apiece, the Pirates led 3\u20132 in the bottom of the ninth inning and were three outs away from advancing to the World Series. But Pirates closer [[Dave Giusti]] unraveled. He surrendered a game-tying home run to [[Johnny Bench]] before allowing back-to-back singles to [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] and [[Denis Menke]] before being relieved by [[Bob Moose]], who almost worked out of the jam by recording two outs. But with pinch-hitter [[Hal McRae]] at the plate, Moose lost his footing and uncorked a wild pitch sending [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]], who was pinch running for P\u00e9rez, home with the pennant-clinching run and setting off a massive celebration at [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]].\n\n====1985 World Series====\n{{Main|1985 World Series}}\n\nPerhaps Michaels's first historic call with ABC Sports while covering Major League Baseball occurred in what is now known by many as the [[Don Denkinger]] game. The [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] trailed the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] 3\u20131 in a series that was panned for being low-scoring and dull. After a Royals win in St. Louis forced the action back to Kansas City, the sixth game was also low scoring. However, this contest grew into a tense pitcher's duel.\n\nIn the bottom of the 9th, pinch-hitter [[Jorge Orta]] led off for the Royals against Cardinals pitcher [[Todd Worrell]] with Kansas City trailing 1\u20130 and hit a ground ball to first baseman [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]]. Clark threw over to pitcher Worrell, who was running over to cover first base in time to beat the speedy Orta and did. Yet first base umpire [[Don Denkinger]] still called Orta safe at first. [[Steve Balboni]] then hit a pop-up to first which Jack Clark missed for an error, keeping Balboni's at-bat alive, and he promptly singled to put men on first and second.\n\nThe infamous and controversial leadoff single by Orta and the Jack Clark error eventually led to the Royals loading the bases and putting the tying run on third base and the winning run on second with one out for [[Dane Iorg]]. Iorg hit a 2-run single and the Royals came back to win 2\u20131. The Royals went on to win Game 7 11\u20130 and complete the comeback after being down 3&nbsp;games to 1. However, it was Denkinger's dubious 'safe' call, and not Iorg's hit, Clark's error, [[Jim Sundberg]]'s heroics (for his difficult slide past catcher [[Darrell Porter]] for the winning run) or the Game 7 blowout that were most remembered in years to come.\n\n====1986 American League Championship Series====\nIn 1986, Michaels was also on hand for what he says was ''\"the greatest of all the thousands of games I've done.\"'' On October 12 at [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim Stadium]], Michaels along with [[Jim Palmer]] called Game 5 of the [[1986 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]. The [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] held a 3&nbsp;games to 1 lead of a best-of-seven against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. In the game, the Angels held a 5\u20132 lead going into the ninth inning. Boston scored two runs on a home run by [[Don Baylor]], closing the gap to 5\u20134.\n\nWhen [[Donnie Moore]] came in to shut down the rally, there were two outs, and a runner on [[first base]], [[Rich Gedman]], who had been [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]]. The Angels were one out from their first-ever trip to the [[World Series]]. But [[Dave Henderson]] hit a 2\u20132 pitch off Moore for a home run, giving the Red Sox a 6\u20135 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore continued to pitch for the Angels. He was able to stifle a 10th inning Red Sox rally by getting [[Jim Rice]] to ground into a [[double play]]. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th-inning via a [[sacrifice fly]] by Henderson. The Angels could not score in the bottom of the 11th and lost the game 7\u20136.\n\nThe defeat still left the Angels in a 3&nbsp;games to 2 advantage, with two more games to play at [[Fenway Park]]. The Angels were not able to recover, losing both games by wide margins, 10\u20134 and 8\u20131. Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS ended with [[Calvin Schiraldi]] striking out [[Jerry Narron]].\n\nDespite the fact that ABC Sports and [[ESPN]] had been under the same corporate umbrella (the [[Walt Disney Company]]) since 1996, Michaels never served as a regular commentator for ''[[ESPN Major League Baseball]]''. The only time that Michaels appeared in an ESPN booth of any kind was as a guest commentator on ''[[Wednesday Night Baseball]]'' in 2003 as part of ESPN's ''Living Legends Series''. Michaels joined [[Gary Thorne]] and [[Joe Morgan]], whom he worked with on ABC's 1989 World Series coverage and served as ABC's #2 baseball team behind Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver in 1989, for a game at [[Dodger Stadium]] between the [[2003 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[2003 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].\n\n====1989 World Series====\n{{Main|1989 World Series}}\n\nOn October 17, 1989, Michaels was in San Francisco, preparing to cover the third game of the [[1989 World Series]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/features/the-1989-world-series-earthquake-oral-history/|title=An oral history of the 1989 World Series, which was dominated by the Oakland A's \u2013 and devastated by the Loma Prieta earthquake|last1=Curtis|first1=Bryan|last2=Lee|first2=Patricia|date=October 30, 2013 |website=Grantland|publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> between the home team, the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]], and the visiting [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. ABC's network telecast began with a recap of the first two games (to the soundtrack of [[James Taylor]]'s \"[[Walking Man|Hello Old Friend]]\"), both won by Oakland. Soon after Michaels handed off to his broadcast partner, [[Tim McCarver]], who started assessing the Giants' chances for victory in the game, the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] struck (at approximately 5:04&nbsp;pm [[Pacific Standard Time|local time]]). Michaels exclaimed \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth\u2014\" as the network feed cut out.<ref name=Magnuson2>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958883-2,00.html \"Earthquake\"].

Michaels relayed his reports to [[Ted Koppel]], who was stationed at the [[ABC News]] bureau in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to Tim McCarver, when the earthquake hit, he, Michaels and Jim Palmer immediately grabbed a hold of what they perceived to be the armrests. In reality, the announcers were clutching on each other's thighs and they were each left with bruises the next day. Years later (on a 1999 ''[[SportsCenter]]'' retrospective about the 1989 World Series earthquake), Al Michaels would boldly admit his strong belief that had the earthquake lasted much longer than 15&nbsp;seconds, he would have been killed. Michaels added that the only time that he really had been scared during the earthquake was when he moved in a position which he perceived to be backward.

Their baseball teams, the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] and the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]], had won pennants, and the people of this region were still basking in the afterglow of each team's success.

Before that, his most notable [[National Football League|NFL]] assignment for ABC was hosting (along with [[Jim Lampley]]) the pre-game coverage of [[Super Bowl XIX]].

Bills kicker [[Scott Norwood]] missed a potentially [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|game-winning field goal]], and thus, ensured the Giants victory.\n\nThe trio of Michaels, [[Dan Dierdorf]] (who joined ''MNF'' the year after Michaels's first), and [[Frank Gifford]] lasted until the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] when Gifford was replaced following disclosure of an extramarital affair. During the 1980s, Gifford would fill-in for Michaels on play-by-play whenever Michaels went on baseball assignments for the League Championship Series ([[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]] and [[1988 National League Championship Series|1988]]) or World Series ([[1987 World Series|1987]] and [[1989 World Series|1989]]).\n\nFormer [[Cincinnati Bengals]] quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] (who left after the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]]) replaced Gifford in [[1998 NFL season|1998]], and Dierdorf was dropped after that season. Unexpectedly, comedian [[Dennis Miller]] joined the cast in [[2000 NFL season|2000]] along with [[Dan Fouts]]. In [[2002 NFL season|2002]], following Miller and Fouts' departure, [[John Madden]] joined Michaels in a well-received pairing.\n\n===''NBA on ABC''===\n{{Main|NBA on ABC}}\nAfter disastrous ratings in the [[2003 NBA Finals]], ABC decided to revamp their lead NBA broadcast team. [[Brad Nessler]] was reassigned to the second broadcast team, where he was joined by [[Sean Elliott]] and [[Dan Majerle]]. Michaels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2009/12/decade-in-review-10-worst-personnel/|title=Decade in Review: 10 worst personnel moves \u2014 Sports Media Watch|website=www.sportsmediawatch.com|date=December 19, 2009}}</ref> was hired to replace Nessler as lead broadcaster of the NBA.\n\nFor the first several weeks of the [[2003-04 NBA season|2003\u20132004 season]], Michaels had no partner. However, [[Doc Rivers]], a critically acclaimed analyst when he worked with [[Turner Sports]], became available after a 1\u201319 start by his [[Orlando Magic]]. Rivers was hired weeks before ABC's Christmas Day season opener. He and Michaels worked that game together, one of only six they did together during the regular season (all other games Rivers worked were with Brad Nessler). During the playoffs, the team worked every single telecast, including the [[2004 NBA Finals]], which saw great improvement in [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]]. During the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]], Doc Rivers was hired by the [[Boston Celtics]]. Though Rivers continued to work games with Michaels throughout the rest of the playoffs, ABC would have to find a new lead analyst for the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004\u20132005 season]].\n\nEarly in the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004\u20132005 season]], ABC found a new partner for Al Michaels. [[Memphis Grizzlies]] coach [[Hubie Brown]], a broadcasting legend with [[NBA on CBS|CBS]], [[NBA on TBS|TBS]], and [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], was forced into retirement due to health reasons and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers. Michaels and Brown began their partnership on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated [[Shaquille O'Neal]]-[[Kobe Bryant]] game. After that game, the two did not do a game together again until March 2005. Michaels became sporadic in NBA coverage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsmediawatch.blogspot.com/2007/08/joe-buck-is-new-al-michaels.html|title=Sports Media Watch: Is Buck the new Michaels?|website=sportsmediawatch.blogspot.com}}</ref> doing two games in early March, and then three more games in April. Brown worked every week of ABC's coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster [[Mike Breen]]. For the [[2005-06 NBA season|2005\u20132006 season]], Al Michaels and Hubie Brown were slated to remain as ABC's number one broadcast team. The duo worked that year's Christmas Day game between the [[2005-06 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[2005-06 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] and was expected to work the NBA Finals together as well. However, due to Michaels's impending departure to [[NBC Sports|NBC]], that plan did not come to fruition.\n\nReplacing Michaels on ''[[NBA on ABC|The NBA on ABC]]'' was Mike Breen, who became the lead broadcaster for an over-the-air NBA package for the first time in his career. Breen worked the [[2006 NBA Finals]] with Hubie Brown, as well as all the main games ABC broadcast that year. This gave ABC its first consistent lead broadcaster since Brad Nessler, as Breen (unlike Michaels) did games every week. To put things into proper perspective, during his two-season tenure as ABC's lead NBA broadcaster, Michaels called just 13 of a possible 26 regular season games, with all but two games taking place from either [[Staples Center|Los Angeles]] (where he resides) or [[Sleep Train Arena|Sacramento]].\n\nBesides his inconsistent work, Michaels (despite being initially seen as adding credibility to ABC's NBA broadcasts in contrast to his predecessor, Brad Nessler) was criticized<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2009/12/decade-in-review-10-worst-personnel/|title=Decade in Review: 10 worst personnel moves|last=Paulsen|date=December 19, 2009|website=Sports Media Watch|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> for apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]'s block of [[Tim Duncan]]'s shot during the [[2005 NBA Playoffs|2005 playoffs]] by calling it a \"great, great contested shot\") expected of a No.&nbsp;1 play-by-play voice. Barry Horn of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' said that Michaels was simply \"not a basketball guy\". Meanwhile, [[Bill Simmons]] said during the [[2005 NBA Finals|2005 Finals]] that Michaels \"shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, 'Only five weeks to the [NFL] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]], I'm almost there!'\"\n\nAnother criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for [[Monday Night Football|football]] and [[Major League Baseball on ABC|baseball broadcasts]], for which he's better known for). The end result was that he would hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA on ABC Can't Live Up to Predecessors|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?menu=A11100&no=299273&rel_no=1&back_url=|work=OhMyNews.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026022139/http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?menu=A11100&no=299273&rel_no=1&back_url=|archivedate=October 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Leaving ABC for NBC===\nIn 2003, he was quoted as saying, \"ABC Sports has been my professional home for the last 26&nbsp;years, and I am delighted that will continue to be for several more...\" after signing a long-term contract extension.<ref name=\"go\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/2003/0211/1507336.html|title=Monday Night Football \u2013 Michaels signs contract extension with ABC|publisher=espn.go.com|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2005 NFL season|2005]], it was announced that ''Monday Night Football'' would be moving from ABC to [[ESPN]] beginning with the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], and partner [[John Madden]] announced he would be joining [[NBC Sports]], which had acquired the rights to ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games. Despite speculation that Michaels might be joining NBC as well, Michaels stated that he would continue as the ''MNF'' play-by-play announcer, stating, \"I feel like I'm a creature of Monday night. I'm home and I'm staying home.\" Plans were for Michaels to be teamed with [[Joe Theismann]] (who would be coming over from ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'') on the Monday night telecasts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2117146 | title=Michaels, Theismann, Kolber, Tafoya to crew MNF |publisher=ESPN  | date=July 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, then-ABC Television President [[Alex Wallau]] said, \"For 26&nbsp;years Al has played a pivotal role here at ABC Sports, and for 17 of those years he's been the face and voice synonymous with television's most successful sports franchise, ''Monday Night Football''...&nbsp;It's Al's outstanding play-by-play coverage, coupled with his breadth of knowledge, experience and enthusiasm, that keep ''MNF'' fans invigorated, excited and coming back for more.\" also, \"Al Michaels has been invaluable to the Network and we are thrilled to have him remain in our family. [...] Al is the consummate professional and makes everyone around him better\" said then-ABC Sports President Howard Katz; however, in the weeks leading up to [[Super Bowl XL]], it was widely speculated that Michaels was attempting to get out of his contract with ESPN to join Madden at NBC. By this time, it was clear that NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' would be the NFL's premier prime-time package, with ESPN's ''Monday Night Football'' relegated to secondary match-ups similar to that network's previous Sunday night telecasts. Michaels added fuel to the fire by refusing to state his future plans, and he couldn't \"respond to rumors ... because that would become a distraction.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/387099p-328468c.html |title=Michaels won't give play-by-play of plans |work=New York Daily News |author=Bob Raissman |date=January 31, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209065238/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/387099p-328468c.html |archivedate=February 9, 2006 }}</ref> On February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that its ''Monday Night Football'' team would consist of [[Mike Tirico]] on play-by-play, with Theismann and [[Tony Kornheiser]] as analysts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2323121 | title=ESPN names new MNF team; Breen to call NBA games |publisher=ESPN  | date=February 10, 2006}}</ref> ESPN explicitly stated that Michaels would not return to either ''Monday Night Football'' broadcasts or ABC's NBA broadcasts (on which Michaels had been lead NBA play-by-play man).\n\n==NBC Sports (2006\u2013present)==\n\n===\"Traded\" to NBC for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit===\n{{Main|NFL on NBC|NBC Sunday Night Football}}\nOn February 9, 2006, NBC confirmed that Michaels would be joining Madden at the network to broadcast football on Sunday nights, thus ending Michaels's 20-year run on ''Monday Night Football'' and almost 30&nbsp;years of service with ABC.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11235692/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222035442/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11235692/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 22, 2006 | title=NBC acquires Michaels for cartoon bunny, golf |agency=Associated Press | date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> In exchange for letting Michaels out of his contract with ABC and ESPN, NBC Universal sold ESPN cable rights to Friday coverage of the next four [[Ryder Cup]]s, granted ESPN increased usage of Olympic highlights, and sold to parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] the rights to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], a cartoon character developed by [[Walt Disney]] himself (which he lost in 1928) but previously owned by Universal Pictures (now NBC Universal).

On April 16, 2009, [[Cris Collinsworth]] made an agreement with NBC to join Michaels on replacing Madden for ''Sunday Night Football''. On February 1, 2009, Michaels called [[Super Bowl XLIII]], his first Super Bowl telecast for NBC and seventh overall as a play-by-play announcer.

In 1970, Michaels appeared as attorney Dave Bronstein in an episode of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' called \"Run, Johnny, Run\" (Air date: January 14, 1970); the episode also featured a young [[Christopher Walken]].\n\nIn [[1971 Cincinnati Reds season|1971]], Michaels moved to [[Cincinnati]], where he became the lead announcer for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. In [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|1972]], after the Reds won the [[1972 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] and advanced to the [[1972 World Series|World Series]], Michaels helped to cover the Fall Classic for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC Sports]]; he also was the network's play-by-play man for the [[Ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics|hockey coverage]] at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo, Japan]].\n\nIn [[1973 NFL season|1973]], after NBC announcer [[Bill Enis]] died from a heart attack at the age of 39 two days before he was assigned to call the regular-season NFL finale between the [[1973 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] and [[1973 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], Michaels was brought in to replace Enis in the booth with [[Dave Kocourek]].\n\nIn [[1974 San Francisco Giants season|1974]], Michaels left the Reds for a similar position with the [[San Francisco Giants]], and also covered basketball for [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], replacing [[Dick Enberg]] on the Bruins' tape-delayed telecasts of their home games, during a period when UCLA was in the midst of an 88-game winning streak.

Also, he served as host for the yearly [[Tiger Woods]] [[Monday Night Golf|Monday night specials]] that aired in July or August.\n\n===The Miracle on Ice===\n{{Main|Miracle on Ice}}\nTwo of Michaels's more famous broadcasts were of the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] ice hockey medal round match between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], and the attempted third game of the [[1989 World Series]].\n\nIn 1980, an unheralded group of college ice hockey players from the United States won the Gold Medal at the [[Olympic Winter Games]]. The medal round match on February 22\u2014which, contrary to popular belief, did not yet assure the team of the gold medal\u2014was of particular interest, as it was played against a heavily favored professional squad from the Soviet Union, and was in front of an incredibly excited pro-American crowd in [[Lake Placid, New York]]. Michaels's memorable broadcast of this game, including his interjection\u2014''\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\"''\u2014as time expired on the 4\u20133 U.S. victory, earned the game the media nickname of ''[[Miracle on Ice|The Miracle on Ice]]''.\n\nMost assume that the game was broadcast live (indeed, [[Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium|CTV]], which held Canadian rights to the game, aired it live); but in reality, the game started at 5:05&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] and ABC decided against pre-empting local and network news (on the East Coast) to carry the game live. Instead, most of it\u2014including the entire third period\u2014was broadcast within the regularly scheduled, prime-time telecast from 8:30 to 11&nbsp;pm Eastern time (and on a six-and-a-half-hour delay on the West Coast from 8:30 to 11&nbsp;pm [[Pacific Standard Time]]). Despite being on tape, the game was one of the highest-rated programs of the 1979\u201380 television season and remains the most-watched ice hockey game in the history of American television.<ref name=\"nhl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=519476|title=Olympic final most-watched hockey game in 30 years \u2013 NHL.com \u2013 All-Access Vancouver|publisher=nhl.com|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMichaels, along with broadcasting partner [[Ken Dryden]], recreated their Olympic commentary in the 2004 movie ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]''. Although Michaels and Dryden recreated the bulk of their commentary for the film, the closing seconds of the game against the Soviet Union used the original ABC Sports commentary from 1980. [[Gavin O'Connor (director)|Gavin O'Connor]], the director of ''Miracle'', decided to use the last 10&nbsp;seconds of Michaels's original ''\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\"'' call in the film because he felt he couldn't ask him to recreate the emotion he experienced at that moment. Thus they cleaned up the recording to make the transition to the authentic call as seamless as possible.\n\nMichaels later recalled, \"When I look back, obviously Lake Placid would be the highlight of my career. I can't think of anything that would ever top it. I can't dream up a scenario.\"\n\nMichaels was only on this particular assignment because he had done one hockey game, eight years prior. The game in question was the gold medal game (the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] vs. [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]]) of the [[Ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics|1972 Winter Olympics]] (on [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]) in [[Sapporo]], Japan. Other announcers on the ABC Sports roster such as [[Keith Jackson]], [[Frank Gifford]], and [[Howard Cosell]] had never done a hockey game before. Michaels recalled this during a ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel|Real Sports]]'' interview in January 2009. Michaels also apparently beat out [[WABC-AM]] and [[New York Islanders]] commentator [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] for the assignment.<ref name=\"nbcumv.com\">[http://www.nbcumv.com/sports/release_detail.nbc/sports-20090305000000-034i039vebeen.html]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Syken|first=Bill|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1108840/index.htm|title=He Missed the Call!|work=Sports Illustrated|date=November 15, 2004|volume=101|issue=19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025194127/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1108840/index.htm|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTwo days later, Michaels would broadcast the gold medal game, in which the U.S. defeated Finland, closing the game out by declaring \"This impossible dream comes true!\"\n\nMichaels<ref>{{YouTube|title=92-93 Playoffs Kings goals vs Flames (Round One)|id=9zZJMB_RHsI}}</ref> along with [[John Davidson (hockey player)|John Davidson]] would later call Games 1 and 4 of the [[1992\u201393 Calgary Flames season|Calgary]]\u2013[[1992\u201393 Los Angeles Kings season|Los Angeles]] [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs#.28S2.29 Calgary Flames vs. .28S3.29 Los Angeles Kings|Stanley Cup playoff]] series in 1993 for [[NHL on ABC|ABC]].\n\n===Memorable baseball moments===\n\n====1972 National League Championship Series====\n{{Main|1972 National League Championship Series}}\n\nEven though the events of October 17, 1989, in San Francisco are widely considered to be the most dramatic baseball-related moment of Michaels's career, he had several others that were memorable.\n\nIn the [[1972 National League Championship Series]], the defending World Series Champion [[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] faced the [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]]. In Game 5, with both teams tied at two games apiece, the Pirates led 3\u20132 in the bottom of the ninth inning and were three outs away from advancing to the World Series. But Pirates closer [[Dave Giusti]] unraveled. He surrendered a game-tying home run to [[Johnny Bench]] before allowing back-to-back singles to [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] and [[Denis Menke]] before being relieved by [[Bob Moose]], who almost worked out of the jam by recording two outs. But with pinch-hitter [[Hal McRae]] at the plate, Moose lost his footing and uncorked a wild pitch sending [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]], who was pinch running for P\u00e9rez, home with the pennant-clinching run and setting off a massive celebration at [[Riverfront Stadium (Cincinnati)|Riverfront Stadium]].\n\n====1985 World Series====\n{{Main|1985 World Series}}\n\nPerhaps Michaels's first historic call with ABC Sports while covering Major League Baseball occurred in what is now known by many as the [[Don Denkinger]] game. The [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] trailed the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] 3\u20131 in a series that was panned for being low-scoring and dull. After a Royals win in St. Louis forced the action back to Kansas City, the sixth game was also low scoring. However, this contest grew into a tense pitcher's duel.\n\nIn the bottom of the 9th, pinch-hitter [[Jorge Orta]] led off for the Royals against Cardinals pitcher [[Todd Worrell]] with Kansas City trailing 1\u20130 and hit a ground ball to first baseman [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]]. Clark threw over to pitcher Worrell, who was running over to cover first base in time to beat the speedy Orta and did. Yet first base umpire [[Don Denkinger]] still called Orta safe at first. [[Steve Balboni]] then hit a pop-up to first which Jack Clark missed for an error, keeping Balboni's at-bat alive, and he promptly singled to put men on first and second.\n\nThe infamous and controversial leadoff single by Orta and the Jack Clark error eventually led to the Royals loading the bases and putting the tying run on third base and the winning run on second with one out for [[Dane Iorg]]. Iorg hit a 2-run single and the Royals came back to win 2\u20131. The Royals went on to win Game 7 11\u20130 and complete the comeback after being down 3&nbsp;games to 1. However, it was Denkinger's dubious 'safe' call, and not Iorg's hit, Clark's error, [[Jim Sundberg]]'s heroics (for his difficult slide past catcher [[Darrell Porter]] for the winning run) or the Game 7 blowout that were most remembered in years to come.\n\n====1986 American League Championship Series====\nIn 1986, Michaels was also on hand for what he says was ''\"the greatest of all the thousands of games I've done.\"'' On October 12 at [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim Stadium]], Michaels along with [[Jim Palmer]] called Game 5 of the [[1986 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]. The [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] held a 3&nbsp;games to 1 lead of a best-of-seven against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. In the game, the Angels held a 5\u20132 lead going into the ninth inning. Boston scored two runs on a home run by [[Don Baylor]], closing the gap to 5\u20134.\n\nWhen [[Donnie Moore]] came in to shut down the rally, there were two outs, and a runner on [[first base]], [[Rich Gedman]], who had been [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]]. The Angels were one out from their first-ever trip to the [[World Series]]. But [[Dave Henderson]] hit a 2\u20132 pitch off Moore for a home run, giving the Red Sox a 6\u20135 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore continued to pitch for the Angels. He was able to stifle a 10th inning Red Sox rally by getting [[Jim Rice]] to ground into a [[double play]]. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th-inning via a [[sacrifice fly]] by Henderson. The Angels could not score in the bottom of the 11th and lost the game 7\u20136.\n\nThe defeat still left the Angels in a 3&nbsp;games to 2 advantage, with two more games to play at [[Fenway Park]]. The Angels were not able to recover, losing both games by wide margins, 10\u20134 and 8\u20131. Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS ended with [[Calvin Schiraldi]] striking out [[Jerry Narron]].\n\nDespite the fact that ABC Sports and [[ESPN]] had been under the same corporate umbrella (the [[Walt Disney Company]]) since 1996, Michaels never served as a regular commentator for ''[[ESPN Major League Baseball]]''. The only time that Michaels appeared in an ESPN booth of any kind was as a guest commentator on ''[[Wednesday Night Baseball]]'' in 2003 as part of ESPN's ''Living Legends Series''. Michaels joined [[Gary Thorne]] and [[Joe Morgan]], whom he worked with on ABC's 1989 World Series coverage and served as ABC's #2 baseball team behind Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver in 1989, for a game at [[Dodger Stadium]] between the [[2003 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[2003 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].\n\n====1989 World Series====\n{{Main|1989 World Series}}\n\nOn October 17, 1989, Michaels was in San Francisco, preparing to cover the third game of the [[1989 World Series]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/features/the-1989-world-series-earthquake-oral-history/|title=An oral history of the 1989 World Series, which was dominated by the Oakland A's \u2013 and devastated by the Loma Prieta earthquake|last1=Curtis|first1=Bryan|last2=Lee|first2=Patricia|date=October 30, 2013 |website=Grantland|publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> between the home team, the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]], and the visiting [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. ABC's network telecast began with a recap of the first two games (to the soundtrack of [[James Taylor]]'s \"[[Walking Man|Hello Old Friend]]\"), both won by Oakland. Soon after Michaels handed off to his broadcast partner, [[Tim McCarver]], who started assessing the Giants' chances for victory in the game, the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] struck (at approximately 5:04&nbsp;pm [[Pacific Standard Time|local time]]). Michaels exclaimed \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth\u2014\" as the network feed cut out.<ref name=Magnuson2>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958883-2,00.html \"Earthquake\"].

Retrieved September 5, 2009.</ref> Michaels then reported from the ABC Sports production truck outside [[Candlestick Park]] on the earthquake, for which he later was nominated for an Emmy Award for news broadcasting. Michaels relayed his reports to [[Ted Koppel]], who was stationed at the [[ABC News]] bureau in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to Tim McCarver, when the earthquake hit, he, Michaels and Jim Palmer immediately grabbed a hold of what they perceived to be the armrests. In reality, the announcers were clutching on each other's thighs and they were each left with bruises the next day. Years later (on a 1999 ''[[SportsCenter]]'' retrospective about the 1989 World Series earthquake), Al Michaels would boldly admit his strong belief that had the earthquake lasted much longer than 15&nbsp;seconds, he would have been killed. Michaels added that the only time that he really had been scared during the earthquake was when he moved in a position which he perceived to be backward. The three announcers were sitting on a ledge<ref>{{cite book |last=Palmer; Maimon|first=Jim; Alan|date= June 2016|title=Jim Palmer: Nine Innings to Success: A Hall of Famer's Approach to Achieving ...|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HwMuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jim+Palmer:+Nine+Innings+to+Success:+A+Hall+of+Famer%27s+Approach+to+Achieving+...#v=snippet&q=ABC&f=false|location= |publisher=Triumph Books LLC|page= |isbn=9781633194625}}</ref> with their backs turned and no bracing behind them.\n\n{{quote|At this very moment ten days ago, we began our telecast with an aerial view of San Francisco; always a spectacular sight, and particularly so on that day because the cloudless sky of October 17 was ice blue, and the reflections of the late-day sun sparkled like a thousand jewels.\n\nThat picture was very much a mirror of the feel and the mood that had enveloped the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] and indeed most of [[Northern California]]. Their baseball teams, the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] and the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]], had won pennants, and the people of this region were still basking in the afterglow of each team's success. And this great American sporting classic, the World Series, was, for the time being, exclusively theirs.\n\nThen, of course, that feeling of pure radiance was transformed into horror and grief and despair in fifteen seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.athleticsnation.com/2009/10/17/1088907/series-interrupted|title=Series, Interrupted|last1=Marquez|first1=Donald|date=October 17, 2009|website=SBNation.com|publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref> And now on October 27, like a fighter who's taken a vicious blow to the stomach and has groggily arisen, this region moves on and moves ahead.\n\nAnd one part of that scenario is the resumption of the World Series.

And for many of the six million people in this region, it will be like revisiting [[Fantasyland]].\n\nBut Fantasyland is where baseball comes from anyway, and maybe, right about now, that's the perfect place for a three-hour rest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2009/11/9/1122749/scrapbook-memories-1989-world|title=Scrapbook Memories: 1989 World Series, Game 3, Part 2|last1=Marquez|first1=Donald|date=November 9, 2009|website=SBNation.com|publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>|Al Michaels at the beginning of [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC's]] telecast of the resumption of Game 3 of the [[1989 World Series]].}}\n\n===''Monday Night Football''===\n{{Main|Monday Night Football}}\nMichaels's longest-running assignment was that of the lead play-by-play announcer on ABC's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' telecasts, a position he held for 20 seasons beginning in [[1986 NFL season|1986]]. Before that, his most notable [[National Football League|NFL]] assignment for ABC was hosting (along with [[Jim Lampley]]) the pre-game coverage of [[Super Bowl XIX]]. In [[1987 NFL season|1988]], Michaels called his first [[Super Bowl XXII|Super Bowl]]. Three years later, Michaels was on hand to call the thrilling [[Super Bowl XXV|Super Bowl]] between the [[1990 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1990 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]. Bills kicker [[Scott Norwood]] missed a potentially [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|game-winning field goal]], and thus, ensured the Giants victory.\n\nThe trio of Michaels, [[Dan Dierdorf]] (who joined ''MNF'' the year after Michaels's first), and [[Frank Gifford]] lasted until the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] when Gifford was replaced following disclosure of an extramarital affair. During the 1980s, Gifford would fill-in for Michaels on play-by-play whenever Michaels went on baseball assignments for the League Championship Series ([[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]] and [[1988 National League Championship Series|1988]]) or World Series ([[1987 World Series|1987]] and [[1989 World Series|1989]]).\n\nFormer [[Cincinnati Bengals]] quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] (who left after the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]]) replaced Gifford in [[1998 NFL season|1998]], and Dierdorf was dropped after that season. Unexpectedly, comedian [[Dennis Miller]] joined the cast in [[2000 NFL season|2000]] along with [[Dan Fouts]]. In [[2002 NFL season|2002]], following Miller and Fouts' departure, [[John Madden]] joined Michaels in a well-received pairing.\n\n===''NBA on ABC''===\n{{Main|NBA on ABC}}\nAfter disastrous ratings in the [[2003 NBA Finals]], ABC decided to revamp their lead NBA broadcast team. [[Brad Nessler]] was reassigned to the second broadcast team, where he was joined by [[Sean Elliott]] and [[Dan Majerle]]. Michaels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2009/12/decade-in-review-10-worst-personnel/|title=Decade in Review: 10 worst personnel moves \u2014 Sports Media Watch|website=www.sportsmediawatch.com|date=December 19, 2009}}</ref> was hired to replace Nessler as lead broadcaster of the NBA.\n\nFor the first several weeks of the [[2003-04 NBA season|2003\u20132004 season]], Michaels had no partner. However, [[Doc Rivers]], a critically acclaimed analyst when he worked with [[Turner Sports]], became available after a 1\u201319 start by his [[Orlando Magic]]. Rivers was hired weeks before ABC's Christmas Day season opener. He and Michaels worked that game together, one of only six they did together during the regular season (all other games Rivers worked were with Brad Nessler). During the playoffs, the team worked every single telecast, including the [[2004 NBA Finals]], which saw great improvement in [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]]. During the [[2004 NBA Playoffs]], Doc Rivers was hired by the [[Boston Celtics]]. Though Rivers continued to work games with Michaels throughout the rest of the playoffs, ABC would have to find a new lead analyst for the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004\u20132005 season]].\n\nEarly in the [[2004-05 NBA season|2004\u20132005 season]], ABC found a new partner for Al Michaels. [[Memphis Grizzlies]] coach [[Hubie Brown]], a broadcasting legend with [[NBA on CBS|CBS]], [[NBA on TBS|TBS]], and [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], was forced into retirement due to health reasons and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers. Michaels and Brown began their partnership on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated [[Shaquille O'Neal]]-[[Kobe Bryant]] game. After that game, the two did not do a game together again until March 2005. Michaels became sporadic in NBA coverage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsmediawatch.blogspot.com/2007/08/joe-buck-is-new-al-michaels.html|title=Sports Media Watch: Is Buck the new Michaels?|website=sportsmediawatch.blogspot.com}}</ref> doing two games in early March, and then three more games in April. Brown worked every week of ABC's coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster [[Mike Breen]]. For the [[2005-06 NBA season|2005\u20132006 season]], Al Michaels and Hubie Brown were slated to remain as ABC's number one broadcast team. The duo worked that year's Christmas Day game between the [[2005-06 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[2005-06 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] and was expected to work the NBA Finals together as well. However, due to Michaels's impending departure to [[NBC Sports|NBC]], that plan did not come to fruition.\n\nReplacing Michaels on ''[[NBA on ABC|The NBA on ABC]]'' was Mike Breen, who became the lead broadcaster for an over-the-air NBA package for the first time in his career. Breen worked the [[2006 NBA Finals]] with Hubie Brown, as well as all the main games ABC broadcast that year. This gave ABC its first consistent lead broadcaster since Brad Nessler, as Breen (unlike Michaels) did games every week. To put things into proper perspective, during his two-season tenure as ABC's lead NBA broadcaster, Michaels called just 13 of a possible 26 regular season games, with all but two games taking place from either [[Staples Center|Los Angeles]] (where he resides) or [[Sleep Train Arena|Sacramento]].\n\nBesides his inconsistent work, Michaels (despite being initially seen as adding credibility to ABC's NBA broadcasts in contrast to his predecessor, Brad Nessler) was criticized<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2009/12/decade-in-review-10-worst-personnel/|title=Decade in Review: 10 worst personnel moves|last=Paulsen|date=December 19, 2009|website=Sports Media Watch|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> for apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]'s block of [[Tim Duncan]]'s shot during the [[2005 NBA Playoffs|2005 playoffs]] by calling it a \"great, great contested shot\") expected of a No.&nbsp;1 play-by-play voice. Barry Horn of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' said that Michaels was simply \"not a basketball guy\". Meanwhile, [[Bill Simmons]] said during the [[2005 NBA Finals|2005 Finals]] that Michaels \"shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, 'Only five weeks to the [NFL] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game|Hall of Fame Game]], I'm almost there!'\"\n\nAnother criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for [[Monday Night Football|football]] and [[Major League Baseball on ABC|baseball broadcasts]], for which he's better known for). The end result was that he would hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA on ABC Can't Live Up to Predecessors|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?menu=A11100&no=299273&rel_no=1&back_url=|work=OhMyNews.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026022139/http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?menu=A11100&no=299273&rel_no=1&back_url=|archivedate=October 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Leaving ABC for NBC===\nIn 2003, he was quoted as saying, \"ABC Sports has been my professional home for the last 26&nbsp;years, and I am delighted that will continue to be for several more...\" after signing a long-term contract extension.<ref name=\"go\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/2003/0211/1507336.html|title=Monday Night Football \u2013 Michaels signs contract extension with ABC|publisher=espn.go.com|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2005 NFL season|2005]], it was announced that ''Monday Night Football'' would be moving from ABC to [[ESPN]] beginning with the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], and partner [[John Madden]] announced he would be joining [[NBC Sports]], which had acquired the rights to ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games. Despite speculation that Michaels might be joining NBC as well, Michaels stated that he would continue as the ''MNF'' play-by-play announcer, stating, \"I feel like I'm a creature of Monday night.

By this time, it was clear that NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' would be the NFL's premier prime-time package, with ESPN's ''Monday Night Football'' relegated to secondary match-ups similar to that network's previous Sunday night telecasts. Michaels added fuel to the fire by refusing to state his future plans, and he couldn't \"respond to rumors ... because that would become a distraction.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/387099p-328468c.html |title=Michaels won't give play-by-play of plans |work=New York Daily News |author=Bob Raissman |date=January 31, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209065238/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/387099p-328468c.html |archivedate=February 9, 2006 }}</ref> On February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that its ''Monday Night Football'' team would consist of [[Mike Tirico]] on play-by-play, with Theismann and [[Tony Kornheiser]] as analysts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2323121 | title=ESPN names new MNF team; Breen to call NBA games |publisher=ESPN  | date=February 10, 2006}}</ref> ESPN explicitly stated that Michaels would not return to either ''Monday Night Football'' broadcasts or ABC's NBA broadcasts (on which Michaels had been lead NBA play-by-play man).\n\n==NBC Sports (2006\u2013present)==\n\n===\"Traded\" to NBC for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit===\n{{Main|NFL on NBC|NBC Sunday Night Football}}\nOn February 9, 2006, NBC confirmed that Michaels would be joining Madden at the network to broadcast football on Sunday nights, thus ending Michaels's 20-year run on ''Monday Night Football'' and almost 30&nbsp;years of service with ABC.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11235692/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222035442/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11235692/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 22, 2006 | title=NBC acquires Michaels for cartoon bunny, golf |agency=Associated Press | date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> In exchange for letting Michaels out of his contract with ABC and ESPN, NBC Universal sold ESPN cable rights to Friday coverage of the next four [[Ryder Cup]]s, granted ESPN increased usage of Olympic highlights, and sold to parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] the rights to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], a cartoon character developed by [[Walt Disney]] himself (which he lost in 1928) but previously owned by Universal Pictures (now NBC Universal).

Michaels had called ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', with [[John Madden]] from August 6, 2006 \u2013 April 15, 2009. On April 16, 2009, [[Cris Collinsworth]] made an agreement with NBC to join Michaels on replacing Madden for ''Sunday Night Football''. On February 1, 2009, Michaels called [[Super Bowl XLIII]], his first Super Bowl telecast for NBC and seventh overall as a play-by-play announcer.

When used correctly, they can provide a valuable aid to investigation.<ref name=\"Graham Coleman\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.buildingpreservation.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=26\n| title = Use of electrical moisture meters\n}}</ref> The competence and experience of the person undertaking the damp investigations is often of greater importance than the kit he or she carries. Experience and qualified surveyors are the difference between a correct and incorrect diagnosis of damp. For example, it is sometimes found that [[Condensation#Condensation in building construction|condensation]] is misdiagnosed as another form of dampness resulting in the wrong form of treatment being specified. Chartered building surveyors are usually experienced in identifying dampness issues, however, their reports often suggest that dampness problems are investigated by a specialist damp and timber surveyor with a CSRT qualification.\n\n==Prevention and treatment==\nMost forms of dampness can be prevented by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include [[damp proofing]] in the form of a synthetic damp-proof course (DPC), about 15&nbsp;cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or \"engineering bricks\" with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.\n\nThere are many approaches to the treatment of dampness in existing buildings. Key to the selection of an appropriate treatment is a correct diagnosis of the types of dampness affecting a building. Details of possible treatments for specific types of dampness are covered in the sections below.\n\nThe cause of the dampness must first be eliminated, by providing better drainage or fixing leaking pipes. Several methods of treating rising damp are possible, including the use of land-drains and the insertion of physical and chemical DPCs <ref name=\"Trotman_a\">{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trotman|volume=BRE Digest 245|publisher=Building Research l Establishment|title=Rising damp in walls, diagnosis and treatment|isbn=978-1-84806-012-8}}</ref>. Then, any affected plaster or mortar must be removed, and the wall treated, before replacing the plaster and repainting.\n\n==Humidity==\nHumidity occurs in indoor environments due to building related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks in the building are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}} The construction of the building can also lead to humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\">{{cite web|last=Prowler|first=Don|title=Mold and Moisture Dynamics|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/moisturedynamics.php|publisher=WBDG: Whole Building Design Guide|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\"/> Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as crawlspaces and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply air ducts in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky return air ducts in homes with crawlspaces.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}}\n\nHuman occupancy adds a significant amount of humidity to the indoor environment. Personal activity as basic as breathing and perspiration add moisture to an indoor space.<ref name=\"Humidity Cooling\">{{cite web |title=Why Humidity Matters when Cooling |url=http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |publisher=Nature's Cooling Solutions |accessdate=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135306/http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Cooking and showering raise humidity levels in the indoor environment, which directly affects the structural dampness of a home. Aspects of the home can also increase the humidity of a space. Items such as aquariums, indoor swimming pools, hot tubs, and even indoor plants add to the humidity of an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> All of these attributes can increase the humidity of a home beyond its recommended thirty to fifty percent.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\nHumidity levels in an indoor environment need to be accounted for based upon season and temperature. If humidity levels do not agree with the time of the year and the temperature during seasons, mold infestation and deterioration of the building will occur due to moisture. An acceptable humidity level in indoor spaces ranges from twenty to sixty per cent year round.<ref name=\"Air Quality\">{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/indoorairqualityguide_fs.htm|publisher=Illinois Department of Public Health|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> However, levels less than twenty per cent in the winter and levels higher than sixty per cent in the summer are deemed unacceptable for indoor air quality.<ref name=\"Air Quality\" /> Structural dampness is likely to occur as well as an increase of health risks associated with moisture damage.\n\n===Prevention and treatment===\nThere are strategies to prevent water infiltration due to humidity into structures, as well as ways to treat human occupancy practices regarding humidity. Vapor retarders are materials that can be used to restrain uncontrolled airflow and water vapor into an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Vapor retarders are used to decrease the rate and amount of water vapor diffusion through ceilings, walls, and floors caused by humidity.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> It is made of thin, flexible materials and its coatings can be installed by trowels or brushes.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Utilizing vapor retarders in a building prevents structural dampness from occurring or continuing if it already exists. A strategy for reducing humidity levels in an indoor environment is by altering occupant activity and indoor mechanics. Kitchens and bathrooms need to have their own vents.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Additionally, washing machines need to be vented outdoors.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Both of these are important in order to decrease indoor moisture due to humidity caused by the activities occurring in these indoor spaces. Moisture sources, such as hot tubs or indoor swimming pools, should be covered by airtight lids when not in use, thus humidity levels stay low in the indoor environment///-.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\n==Condensation==\nCondensation comes from water vapour within the building. Common sources may include cooking, bathing, dishwashers, etc. The moisture in the air condenses on cold surfaces, sometimes inside the walls called [[interstitial condensation]]. Buildings with poorly insulated walls are very prone to this problem. It often causes damage similar to damp in a building and often appears in similar places. This is because it occurs in the \"dead air\" pockets that accumulate in both horizontal and vertical corners (i.e. out of circulating air patterns).\n\n[[File:Mould Caused By Condensation.jpg|thumb|Mould growth caused by condensation in dead air pocket behind books]]\n\nMoisture condenses on the interiors of buildings due to specific interactions between the roof and wall. Leaks most commonly occur on flat-roofed buildings.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|328}} Certain building materials and mechanisms can be used to prevent condensation from occurring in these areas, therefore reducing structural dampness and potential mold infestation. In many cases, the insulation between the roof and wall is compressed, leading to a decrease in thermal resistance.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Due to the lack of thermal resistance, condensation occurs, which leads to water damage in the indoor environment. In most cases where moisture is not addressed quickly enough, mold and mildew develop. Another issue is that wind washing up into the crevice where the roof and wall intersect reduces the efficiency of the insulation.<ref name=\"Roof Surface\">{{cite web|title=The Leaky Roof Surface |url=http://livingwithmyhome.com/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |work=Living With My Home |publisher=Pillar To Post, Inc. |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916001154/http://www.livingwithmyhome.com:80/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |archivedate=16 September 2011 }}</ref> This results in condensation and risk for mold growth.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, condensation problems are particularly common between October and March&nbsp;\u2013 to the extent that this period is often referred to as the \"condensation season.\"<ref name=\"Peter MacDonald Condensation\">[http://www.dampdecay.co.uk/index.php/condensation-explained/94-condensation-1-the-condensation-season-october-until-march The Condensation Season - October until March], Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained.</ref>\n\n===Identification of condensation===\nIf it is suspected that the problem is condensation, then a room should be sealed off with a [[dehumidifier]] left running for the recommended time and then further instrument tests made.

It can occur through walls, roofs, or through openings (e.g. window reveals).<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nWater will often penetrate the outer envelope of a building and appear inside. Common defects include:\n* Roof defects such as faulty [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]], cracked or missing slates or tiles.\n* Faults in the brickwork or masonry such as missing or cracked [[repointing|pointing]]. Porous bricks or stones.\n* Missing or defective mastic around windows and doors.\n* Blocked [[weep hole]]s.\n* Missing or defective trays in [[cavity wall]]s.\n\n===Walls===\nRain penetration is most often associated with single-skin walls, but can also occur through cavity walls - e.g. by tracking across wall ties.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nSingle-skin brick walls of standard thickness (9 inches) have been considered to provide inadequate resistance to rain penetration for many years, which is why [[Cavity wall|cavity wall construction]] is now standard in the UK. The 1944 Housing Manual published by the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Health stated that:<blockquote>''\"The resistance to penetration of rain should not be less than that of 11-in. brick cavity wall, properly designed and constructed with attention to details at the heads and joints of openings. An unrendered 9-in. wall is regarded as substandard.\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Housing manual : 1944|last=Gran Bretagna. Ministry of Health.|date=1944|publisher=His Majesty's stationery office|oclc=1110914533}}</ref></blockquote>Whilst renders are often applied in an attempt to resist rain penetration, they must be maintained in good condition in order to fulfil this function. Even relatively small cracks in renders can allow rain penetration to pass into the underlying masonry. In his 1954 book, \"The Restoration of Old Houses\" Hugh Braun highlighted problems inherent in certain types of render that were widely used in the late eighteenth century and throughout the Victorian era:\n\n''\"By the end of the eighteenth century a number of patent water-repellent cements were appearing on the market, the most popular of which, roman cement, continued in universal use throughout the Victorian era; many old buildings were rendered with this substance. Its adhesion was poor and it will often be found that it has become separated from the walling over considerable areas and can be stripped away in large sheets.\"'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Restoration of Old Houses|last=Braun|first=Hugh|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n====Primary Causes====\n\n* Porous masonry (i.e. under-fired bricks, porous stone, or porous mortar)\n* Cracks\n* Defective pointing\n* Unfilled joints and perpends,\n* Defective seals around doors and windows\n* Holes in walls&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. where cables or pipes protrude\n* Defective render\n\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Primary Causes of Penetrating Damp\n|width=160\n|height=170\n|lines=4\n|align=center\n|File:Crack in Render.jpg|Cracks in render and masonry provide a pathway for damp to penetrate.\n|File:Defective-pointing.jpg|Defective pointing can allow rain to penetrate through masonry walls\n|File:Porous-bricks.jpg|Porous bricks combined with poorly-maintained rainwater goods leading to penetrating damp.\n|File:Hole_in_brick_masonry_wall.jpg|Hole in brick wall provides a path for rain penetration.\n\n\n}}\n\n====Exacerbators of Rain penetration====\n\nWhere a wall suffers from one or more of the primary causes of rain penetration listed above, the problem can be made worse by one of the following exacerbators of rain penetration:\n* Defective rainwater goods\n* Moss growth on roof tiles (causing blockage of rainwater goods)\n* Defective or missing window sills (causing high concentrations of rainwater to bear on section of wall below window)\n* Non-breathable coatings such as acrylic masonry paints&nbsp;\u2013 especially where applied to a poorly prepared masonry substrate\n* Location/aspect of wall&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. walls facing prevailing wind are more prone to rain penetration problems (see [[British Standard 8104|BS8104]])\n* Periods of extreme rainfall&nbsp;\u2013 walls that are normally thick enough to prevent rainfall from reaching the inner face can be overwhelmed during periods of heavy, persistent rainfall\n\nModifications to a building involving impermeable materials can also exacerbate the symptoms of rain penetration by trapping moisture. This can be a particular problem with regard to the installation of retrofit external wall insulation (EWI).\n\n==Rising damp==\n\n[[File:Rising-damp.jpg|thumb|left|Moderate rising damp on an internal wall.]]\n\n{{globalize||UK date=August 2012|date=August 2012}} \nRising damp is the common term for absorption of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by [[capillary action]].

The effect can easily be seen by simply placing a piece of porous brick, stone, or mortar in a shallow tray of water and observing how the water is absorbed into the porous material and is transported above the water line.\n\nRising damp can be identified by a characteristic \"tide mark\" on the lower section of affected walls.

However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nOne indicator that is often used to determine if the source of dampness is rising damp (rather than other forms of dampness) is to look for the presence of salts&nbsp;\u2013 in particular a tell tale \"salt band\" or \"tide mark\" at the peak of the damp's rise. This is not a reliable method as salts and dampness can enter the fabric of the wall in other ways&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. unwashed sea sand or gravel used in the construction of the wall.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nIf there is no damp-proof course and rising damp is suspected (tide mark, moisture confined to lower section of wall etc.&nbsp;...) then a number of diagnostic techniques can be used to determine the source of dampness. BRE Digest 245 states that the most satisfactory approach is to obtain samples of mortar in the affected wall using a drill and then analysing these samples to determine their moisture and salt content to assist in providing appropriate remedial building solutions.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The fact that this technique is destructive to the wall finish often makes it unacceptable to homeowners. It is for this reason that electrical moisture meters are often used when surveying for rising damp. These instruments are unable to accurately measure the moisture content of masonry, as they were developed for use on timber, but the reading patterns that are achieved can provide useful indicators of the source of dampness.<ref name=\"Graham Coleman\"/>\n\n===Rising damp treatment===\nIn many cases, damp is caused by \"bridging\" of a damp-proof course that is otherwise working effectively. For example, a flower bed next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled up against the wall above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the flower bed to below DPC level.\n\nWhere a rising damp problem is caused by a lack of a damp-proof course (common in buildings over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed damp-proof course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include:\n* Replacement physical damp proof course\n* Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)\n* Damp-proofing rods\n* Porous tubes / other evaporative\n* Land drainage\n* Electrical-osmotic systems\n\n====Replacement physical damp proof course====\n[[File:Brickwork 8.png|thumb|right|An example of a damp proof course of slate in a brick wall intended to prevent rising damp]]\nA physical damp proof course made from plastic can be installed into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the damp proof course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment.\n\n====Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)====\nInjection of a liquid or cream into bricks or mortar is the most common method of treating rising damp.\n\nLiquid-injection products were introduced in the 1950s and were typically installed using funnels (gravity feed method) or pressured injection pumps. The effectiveness of liquid injection damp proofing products is dependent on the type of formulation and the skill of the installer. In practice injection times tend to be lower than those required to provide a damp proof course of optimum effectiveness. A paper published in Building and Environment in 1990 made the following calculations about injection times:\n\n{{quote|The results of these calculations for a range of bricks and one building stone suggest that when high pressure injection is used the time of injection is unlikely to be less than five minutes per hole and may exceed 20 minutes per hole even for relatively permeable and porous materials. The times calculated for low pressure infusion of repellents range from 8 hours to 44 hours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=I'Anson|first=S J|author2=Hoff|title=Chemical Injection Treatment for Rising Damp - II. Calculation of Injection Times|journal=Building and Environment|year=1990|volume=25|issue=1|pages=63\u201370|doi=10.1016/0360-1323(90)90042-p}}</ref>}}\n\n=====Damp-Proofing Creams=====\n[[File:Dpc-cream.jpg|thumb|Damp-proofing cream leaking from injection holes. This can make it difficult to ascertain whether sufficient cream has remained in the holes for treatment to be successful.]]\nSince the early 2000s, damp-proofing creams have taken over from liquid products due to improved ease of application. As with liquid products these are based on silane/siloxane active ingredients which line the pores of the mortar to repel damp.\n\nThe effectiveness of liquid and cream based rising damp treatments varies considerably between products due to variations in product formulations. Independent test certifications such as British Board of Agreement (BBA) certificates are available for some products, showing that they have met a minimum requirement for product performance - see [[#Damp_(structural)/Effectiveness_of_rising_damp_treatments]]\n\nAs with liquid injection systems, cream based treatments rely on the competence of the installer for treatment to be successful. Injection holes need to be fully cleared of drill dust and debris before the cream is injected, and it is often difficult to know if each injection hole has been completely filled with cream. Furthermore, damp-proofing cream can sometimes drip out of the injection holes after treatment, reducing the effectiveness of the damp-proofing treatment.\n\n====Damp-proofing rods====\n[[File:Damp-proofing rods.jpg|thumb|left|A packet of damp-proofing rods]] [[File:Damp rods in wall.jpg|thumb|right|Damp-proofing rods installed along a mortar course to treat rising damp by forming a damp-proof course (DPC)]]Damp-proofing rods use similar active ingredients to those found in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. Damp-proofing rods are available with BBA approval.\n\nThe rods are placed into holes drilled in the mortar course and the active ingredients diffuse along the mortar line before curing to form a damp-proof course.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.btpreservation.co.uk/news-item/advanced-dryrod-damp-proofing-system-arrives-yorkshire/ | title=The advanced DryRod damp proofing system arrives in Yorkshire | accessdate=26 January 2015 | website=Brick-Tie Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nDamp-proofing rods are usually supplied in 180mm lengths suitable for inserting into a 9-inch thick wall. For treating half-brick thick (4.5 inch) walls, the rods are simply cut in half.\n\nA benefit of damp-proofing rods compared with damp-proofing creams and liquids is that it is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes.\n\n====Porous tubes====\nPorous tubes are installed along a mortar course. In theory these encourage evaporation and reduce the rise of the damp. Independent test certification are available for this type of product and tests carried out by the Building Research Establishment suggest that they are effective at controlling rising damp.\n[[File:Porous-tubes-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Porous tubes used to treat rising damp are visible on the outside of this Victorian house.]]\n{{quote|Porous ceramic tubes were an early technic to produce a method of combating rising damp; in the 1920s this technique was marketed by British Knapen. Tests were written up in the Building Research Station Annual Report of 1930: 'There have been tests to determine the effect on the rate of evaporation of moisture of inclined porous clay tubes set in specimens of brickwork and natural stone. Laboratory experiments and field tests have been carried out. Results indicate an increase of evaporation of moisture results from the use of these tubes.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n====Land drainage====\nIt has been suggested that improving drainage around walls affected by rising damp can help to reduce the height of rise by reducing the amount of water available to be absorbed into the capillaries of the wall. Typically a trench would be excavated around the affected wall into which a porous pipe would be laid. The trench would then be back-filled with a porous material such as a single-sized aggregate, forming a [[French drain]].\n\nSuch a system would obviously have the practical disadvantage of being suitable only for the treatment of outside walls and would be impractical where other buildings are close by or where a building has shallow footings. Although the theory of reducing rising damp by reducing the amount of moisture in the underlying ground would appear to be sound, there is little data to suggest that it is effective in practice. Indeed, G and I Massari stated in the ICCROM publication \"Damp Buildings Old and New\" that little effect was observed with \"open trenching\" and no effect was observed with \"covered trenching.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Electrical-osmotic systems====\nThese attempt to control rising damp through the phenomenon of [[Electro-osmosis|electro osmosis]]. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that these systems can be useful in moving salts in walls <ref name=\"Ottosen\">{{cite book|first=Lisbeth|last=Ottosen |author2=Anne J Pedersen |author3=Inge Rorig-Dalgaard|title=Salt related problems in brick masonry and electrokinetic removal of salts|publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal}}</ref> there is little in the way of independent data to demonstrate effectiveness in treating rising damp. The BRE publication \"Understanding Dampness\" makes the following observations about electro osmotic systems for the treatment of rising damp:\n\n{{quote|There are two types: active and passive; neither has been approved by a recognised laboratory. By far the greater number of systems are of the passive kind, where there is no external source of electricity. They have always been something of a controversial issue. On theoretical grounds, it remains a mystery as to how they can work; their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in the laboratory and field evidence is disappointing.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n===Effectiveness of rising damp treatments===\nBRE Digest 245 suggests that with the exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. [[British Board of Agr\u00e9ment]] Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp. It then goes on to state that the only method of currently satisfying this requirement is DPC injection (liquid or cream&nbsp;\u2013 although damp-proofing rods have subsequently been made available with BBA approval) and that \"this is the only method which BRE considers suitable where insertion of a physical DPC is not possible.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveryors (RICS) publication \"Remedying Damp\" is more cautious about reliance on third party accreditation, casting doubt upon the validity of the test methods employed, arguing that trials are usually conducted using \"specially built masonry panels&nbsp;\u2013 which do not match up in many respects to walls found in real properties,\" and that \"if a DPC were proved {{em|to not}} work in a specially built masonry panel, this would be the more significant result.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\">{{cite book|first=Ralph|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=85|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref> The MOAT No 39 test<ref>{{cite book|title=The Assessment of Damp-proof Course Systems for Existing Buildings, MOAT No.39|publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment}}</ref> employed by the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) in the UK is dismissed as \"quite a clever test idea but in the author's opinion not actually replicating a real wall.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\"/> The author, Ralph Burkinshaw, has developed his own test method which he has published under the title, ''\"The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application.\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jba/journal/v6/n1/full/jba201013a.html |title=The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application. |last1=Burkinshaw |first1=Ralph |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014 the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment confirmed that it would consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates with a view to updating the MOAT No.39 test in light of the fact that it was not originally designed to test damp proofing creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBA Statement on Chemical Damp Proofing Creams |url=http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417023458/http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-17 }}</ref> This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said Damp-proofing creams differ from fluid-based damp-proofing treatments in a number of ways:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/228945025/BBA-Statement-on-Damp-Proofing-Creams|title=BBA Statement on Damp-proofing Creams - October 2013}}</ref>\n\n# Creams are applied at much lower application rates than is typical for fluid injection and are designed to spread through masonry by diffusion without the assistance of pressure injection. Owing to the number of different mortar types and moisture contents, it is necessary to test these materials under a wider range of conditions. Research undertaken by the BBA has indicated that the performance of creams differs with varying test conditions, with not all products performing well under all test conditions.\n# The amount of active material delivered per linear metre varies considerably between cream formulations. Injection systems were typically injected at an application rate of approximately 100g of active ingredient per linear metre of 275&nbsp;mm (9 inch) thick wall. However, because the strength of cream formulations used in the UK can vary widely, the applied amount of delivered active material varied from 22g to 107g per linear metre depending on product strength. As there is limited historical data on the durability of chemical creams with low levels of active material, it is difficult to draw conclusions on their life expectancy in comparison to high strength creams which have similar active material levels to injected systems.\n\nIn his book, Dampness in Buildings, Alan Oliver refers to research carried out in Belgium regarding the effectiveness of different types of rising damp treatments:\n\n{{quote|In Belgium, at the Centre Scientifique et Technique de la Construction (CTSC, 1985), research was carried out on the effectiveness of the main retrofit DPCs found in Europe. It was generally found that physical DPCs performed best, followed by the various chemical DPCs, with electro osmosis and atmospheric syphons being the least effective.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Oliver|title=Dampness in Buildings - Second Edition|publisher=Blackwall Science|page=206|isbn=0-632-04085-8|date=1997-01-30}}</ref>}}\n\n===Replastering===\nReplastering will often be carried out as part of a rising damp treatment. Where plaster has become severely damaged by ground salts there is little argument about the need to replaster. However, there is considerable debate about:\n\n# The extent of replastering required\n# The use of hard sand:cement renders to replaster as part of a rising damp treatment\n\n[[File:Plaster-removed-rising-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaster removed from a wall as part of a rising damp treatment. The wall was replastered using a sand-cement render.]]\n\nBS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\">{{cite book|title=BS6576:2005, Code of practice for diagnosis of rising damp in walls of buildings and installation of chemical damp proof courses|publisher=BSI|page=9|isbn=0-580-46867-4}}</ref> states that \"the function of the new plaster is to prevent hygroscopic salts that might be present in the wall from migrating through to its surface, while still allowing the wall to dry.\" However, writing in the RICS publication \"Remedying Damp\", Ralph Burkinshaw claims that, \"the plaster is really there for {{em|two}} main reasons.\" He accepts the need for replastering when significant amounts of ground salts have built up in the existing plaster, but he then goes on to say that replastering is often carried out to make up for an unreliable chemical DPC. He also suggests that damp-proofers have an incentive to carry out more replastering than is strictly necessary as it allows them to finish the job without having to wait for walls to dry out, resulting in faster payment.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=81|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sand-cement-render.jpg|thumbnail|left|Application of a sand:cement render to a wall as part of a rising damp treatment]]\nAlthough the sand-cement renders typically installed as part of a rising damp treatment are very effective at holding back damp and ground salts, they have a number of disadvantages. These include an incompatibility with the soft bricks and mortars encountered in older buildings and a lack of insulation properties compared with more traditional plasters, resulting in an increased risk of condensation. Replastering is also one of the most expensive parts of a rising damp treatment.\n\nPorous renders to German WTA specification 2-2-91 can be used as an alternative to dense sand-cement renders. These have a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume. Salts crystallise in these pores rather than on the plaster surface, avoiding decorative spoiling. Such plasters offer a better solution than dense sand-cement renders when used on moderately salt-contaminated walls as their porous nature gives them insulation properties, resulting in a warmer surface temperature and making condensation problems less likely to occur. However, when used on heavily salt contaminated walls they may need to be replaced frequently as they lose effectiveness once all the pores have become filled with crystallised salt.<ref>WTA Merkblatt 2-6-99/D. Endg\u00fcltige Fassung Juli 2001 - {{ISBN|978-3-8167-6794-7}}</ref> The \"Renovation Mortars\" described in EN998-1:2003<ref>{{cite book|title=BS EN 998-1:2003 Specification for mortar for masonry - Part 1:Rendering and plastering mortar|publisher=British Standards Institution |page=7|isbn=0-580-42780-3}}</ref> are described as being designed for use on \"moist masonry walls containing soluble salts.\" The performance requirements for these types of mortars are based on German WTA specification 2-2-91 but without the requirement for a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume.\n\nMore recently, systems have become available that allow plasterboard or insulation board to be used to replaster walls affected by rising damp. After the existing plaster has been hacked off the wall, a salt and moisture retardant cream is applied to the wall. The plasterboard is then applied to the wall using a salt/moisture-proof adhesive. Such systems have the advantage that they can be decorated straight away, rather than having to wait several days or weeks (as would be the case with standard plasters). They also provide a warmer surface that is less prone to condensation than would be the case with a standard sand:cement render.\n\nReplastering may not be necessary where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\"/> states that \"Where the plaster appears to be in sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete.\" Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial damp-proof course will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the damp-proofing system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out.\n\n====Redecoration====\nIt is best practice to delay replastering and redecoration for as long as possible following rising damp treatment, but this obviously creates inconvenience to the occupants of the affected building. BRE Digest 245 states that \"While the wall should be allowed to dry for as long as possible, replastering can follow, providing porous decorations are selected. These are usually matt emulsions and water-based paints, both of which will allow the wall to breathe. Application of gloss and vinyl paints or wallpapers should be delayed for at least one year.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nPlasterboard-based replastering systems have the advantage that immediate redecoration is possible irrespective of which decorative finish is chosen.\n\nDue to the fact that rising damp often co-exists with other forms of dampness such as condensation, the use of a mould resistant emulsion paint is often recommended.\n\n===In popular culture===\nIn [[Calling All Cars (The Sopranos)|''The Sopranos'' episode \"Calling All Cars\"]], [[Janice Soprano]] adopts the identity \"Rising Damp\" (along with the AOL username \"Vlad666\") to instant message [[Bobby Baccalieri]]'s children, Little Bobby and Sophia, who are grieving for their newly departed mother, and to direct them to communicate further via [[Ouija board]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling All Cars (4.11) |website= Sopranos Autopsy|url=https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* Institute of Specialist Surveyors and Engineers (ISSE - UK) [http://www.isse.org.uk The UK - based international institute specialising in structural damp, committed to creating & raising standards and representing the highest of standards within this industry]\n* Howell, Jeff.

Experience and qualified surveyors are the difference between a correct and incorrect diagnosis of damp. For example, it is sometimes found that [[Condensation#Condensation in building construction|condensation]] is misdiagnosed as another form of dampness resulting in the wrong form of treatment being specified. Chartered building surveyors are usually experienced in identifying dampness issues, however, their reports often suggest that dampness problems are investigated by a specialist damp and timber surveyor with a CSRT qualification.\n\n==Prevention and treatment==\nMost forms of dampness can be prevented by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include [[damp proofing]] in the form of a synthetic damp-proof course (DPC), about 15&nbsp;cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or \"engineering bricks\" with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.\n\nThere are many approaches to the treatment of dampness in existing buildings. Key to the selection of an appropriate treatment is a correct diagnosis of the types of dampness affecting a building. Details of possible treatments for specific types of dampness are covered in the sections below.\n\nThe cause of the dampness must first be eliminated, by providing better drainage or fixing leaking pipes. Several methods of treating rising damp are possible, including the use of land-drains and the insertion of physical and chemical DPCs <ref name=\"Trotman_a\">{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trotman|volume=BRE Digest 245|publisher=Building Research l Establishment|title=Rising damp in walls, diagnosis and treatment|isbn=978-1-84806-012-8}}</ref>. Then, any affected plaster or mortar must be removed, and the wall treated, before replacing the plaster and repainting.\n\n==Humidity==\nHumidity occurs in indoor environments due to building related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks in the building are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}} The construction of the building can also lead to humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\">{{cite web|last=Prowler|first=Don|title=Mold and Moisture Dynamics|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/moisturedynamics.php|publisher=WBDG: Whole Building Design Guide|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\"/> Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as crawlspaces and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply air ducts in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky return air ducts in homes with crawlspaces.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}}\n\nHuman occupancy adds a significant amount of humidity to the indoor environment. Personal activity as basic as breathing and perspiration add moisture to an indoor space.<ref name=\"Humidity Cooling\">{{cite web |title=Why Humidity Matters when Cooling |url=http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |publisher=Nature's Cooling Solutions |accessdate=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135306/http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Cooking and showering raise humidity levels in the indoor environment, which directly affects the structural dampness of a home. Aspects of the home can also increase the humidity of a space. Items such as aquariums, indoor swimming pools, hot tubs, and even indoor plants add to the humidity of an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> All of these attributes can increase the humidity of a home beyond its recommended thirty to fifty percent.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\nHumidity levels in an indoor environment need to be accounted for based upon season and temperature. If humidity levels do not agree with the time of the year and the temperature during seasons, mold infestation and deterioration of the building will occur due to moisture. An acceptable humidity level in indoor spaces ranges from twenty to sixty per cent year round.<ref name=\"Air Quality\">{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/indoorairqualityguide_fs.htm|publisher=Illinois Department of Public Health|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> However, levels less than twenty per cent in the winter and levels higher than sixty per cent in the summer are deemed unacceptable for indoor air quality.<ref name=\"Air Quality\" /> Structural dampness is likely to occur as well as an increase of health risks associated with moisture damage.\n\n===Prevention and treatment===\nThere are strategies to prevent water infiltration due to humidity into structures, as well as ways to treat human occupancy practices regarding humidity. Vapor retarders are materials that can be used to restrain uncontrolled airflow and water vapor into an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Vapor retarders are used to decrease the rate and amount of water vapor diffusion through ceilings, walls, and floors caused by humidity.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> It is made of thin, flexible materials and its coatings can be installed by trowels or brushes.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Utilizing vapor retarders in a building prevents structural dampness from occurring or continuing if it already exists. A strategy for reducing humidity levels in an indoor environment is by altering occupant activity and indoor mechanics. Kitchens and bathrooms need to have their own vents.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Additionally, washing machines need to be vented outdoors.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Both of these are important in order to decrease indoor moisture due to humidity caused by the activities occurring in these indoor spaces. Moisture sources, such as hot tubs or indoor swimming pools, should be covered by airtight lids when not in use, thus humidity levels stay low in the indoor environment///-.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\n==Condensation==\nCondensation comes from water vapour within the building. Common sources may include cooking, bathing, dishwashers, etc. The moisture in the air condenses on cold surfaces, sometimes inside the walls called [[interstitial condensation]]. Buildings with poorly insulated walls are very prone to this problem. It often causes damage similar to damp in a building and often appears in similar places. This is because it occurs in the \"dead air\" pockets that accumulate in both horizontal and vertical corners (i.e. out of circulating air patterns).\n\n[[File:Mould Caused By Condensation.jpg|thumb|Mould growth caused by condensation in dead air pocket behind books]]\n\nMoisture condenses on the interiors of buildings due to specific interactions between the roof and wall. Leaks most commonly occur on flat-roofed buildings.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|328}} Certain building materials and mechanisms can be used to prevent condensation from occurring in these areas, therefore reducing structural dampness and potential mold infestation. In many cases, the insulation between the roof and wall is compressed, leading to a decrease in thermal resistance.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Due to the lack of thermal resistance, condensation occurs, which leads to water damage in the indoor environment. In most cases where moisture is not addressed quickly enough, mold and mildew develop. Another issue is that wind washing up into the crevice where the roof and wall intersect reduces the efficiency of the insulation.<ref name=\"Roof Surface\">{{cite web|title=The Leaky Roof Surface |url=http://livingwithmyhome.com/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |work=Living With My Home |publisher=Pillar To Post, Inc. |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916001154/http://www.livingwithmyhome.com:80/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |archivedate=16 September 2011 }}</ref> This results in condensation and risk for mold growth.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, condensation problems are particularly common between October and March&nbsp;\u2013 to the extent that this period is often referred to as the \"condensation season.\"<ref name=\"Peter MacDonald Condensation\">[http://www.dampdecay.co.uk/index.php/condensation-explained/94-condensation-1-the-condensation-season-october-until-march The Condensation Season - October until March], Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained.</ref>\n\n===Identification of condensation===\nIf it is suspected that the problem is condensation, then a room should be sealed off with a [[dehumidifier]] left running for the recommended time and then further instrument tests made.

It can occur through walls, roofs, or through openings (e.g. window reveals).<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nWater will often penetrate the outer envelope of a building and appear inside. Common defects include:\n* Roof defects such as faulty [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]], cracked or missing slates or tiles.\n* Faults in the brickwork or masonry such as missing or cracked [[repointing|pointing]]. Porous bricks or stones.\n* Missing or defective mastic around windows and doors.\n* Blocked [[weep hole]]s.\n* Missing or defective trays in [[cavity wall]]s.\n\n===Walls===\nRain penetration is most often associated with single-skin walls, but can also occur through cavity walls - e.g. by tracking across wall ties.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nSingle-skin brick walls of standard thickness (9 inches) have been considered to provide inadequate resistance to rain penetration for many years, which is why [[Cavity wall|cavity wall construction]] is now standard in the UK. The 1944 Housing Manual published by the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Health stated that:<blockquote>''\"The resistance to penetration of rain should not be less than that of 11-in. brick cavity wall, properly designed and constructed with attention to details at the heads and joints of openings. An unrendered 9-in. wall is regarded as substandard.\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Housing manual : 1944|last=Gran Bretagna. Ministry of Health.|date=1944|publisher=His Majesty's stationery office|oclc=1110914533}}</ref></blockquote>Whilst renders are often applied in an attempt to resist rain penetration, they must be maintained in good condition in order to fulfil this function. Even relatively small cracks in renders can allow rain penetration to pass into the underlying masonry. In his 1954 book, \"The Restoration of Old Houses\" Hugh Braun highlighted problems inherent in certain types of render that were widely used in the late eighteenth century and throughout the Victorian era:\n\n''\"By the end of the eighteenth century a number of patent water-repellent cements were appearing on the market, the most popular of which, roman cement, continued in universal use throughout the Victorian era; many old buildings were rendered with this substance. Its adhesion was poor and it will often be found that it has become separated from the walling over considerable areas and can be stripped away in large sheets.\"'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Restoration of Old Houses|last=Braun|first=Hugh|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n====Primary Causes====\n\n* Porous masonry (i.e. under-fired bricks, porous stone, or porous mortar)\n* Cracks\n* Defective pointing\n* Unfilled joints and perpends,\n* Defective seals around doors and windows\n* Holes in walls&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. where cables or pipes protrude\n* Defective render\n\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Primary Causes of Penetrating Damp\n|width=160\n|height=170\n|lines=4\n|align=center\n|File:Crack in Render.jpg|Cracks in render and masonry provide a pathway for damp to penetrate.\n|File:Defective-pointing.jpg|Defective pointing can allow rain to penetrate through masonry walls\n|File:Porous-bricks.jpg|Porous bricks combined with poorly-maintained rainwater goods leading to penetrating damp.\n|File:Hole_in_brick_masonry_wall.jpg|Hole in brick wall provides a path for rain penetration.\n\n\n}}\n\n====Exacerbators of Rain penetration====\n\nWhere a wall suffers from one or more of the primary causes of rain penetration listed above, the problem can be made worse by one of the following exacerbators of rain penetration:\n* Defective rainwater goods\n* Moss growth on roof tiles (causing blockage of rainwater goods)\n* Defective or missing window sills (causing high concentrations of rainwater to bear on section of wall below window)\n* Non-breathable coatings such as acrylic masonry paints&nbsp;\u2013 especially where applied to a poorly prepared masonry substrate\n* Location/aspect of wall&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. walls facing prevailing wind are more prone to rain penetration problems (see [[British Standard 8104|BS8104]])\n* Periods of extreme rainfall&nbsp;\u2013 walls that are normally thick enough to prevent rainfall from reaching the inner face can be overwhelmed during periods of heavy, persistent rainfall\n\nModifications to a building involving impermeable materials can also exacerbate the symptoms of rain penetration by trapping moisture. This can be a particular problem with regard to the installation of retrofit external wall insulation (EWI).\n\n==Rising damp==\n\n[[File:Rising-damp.jpg|thumb|left|Moderate rising damp on an internal wall.]]\n\n{{globalize||UK date=August 2012|date=August 2012}} \nRising damp is the common term for absorption of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by [[capillary action]].

The effect can easily be seen by simply placing a piece of porous brick, stone, or mortar in a shallow tray of water and observing how the water is absorbed into the porous material and is transported above the water line.\n\nRising damp can be identified by a characteristic \"tide mark\" on the lower section of affected walls.

Further work has confirmed experimentally the importance of mortar properties in determining the height to which damp will rise in walls.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''BRE Digest'' 245 lists several factors that can influence the height of the rise including rate of evaporation from the wall, pore sizes of the masonry, salt content of the materials and the soil, groundwater and degree of saturation, and use of heating within the property.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The effect of seasonal variations in evaporation rate on the height of moisture rise have been comprehensively described.<ref name=\"HallHHV11\">{{Cite journal | last=Hall | first=Christopher |last2 = Hamilton | first2=Andrea | last3=Hoff | first3=William D | last4=Viles | first4= Heather A | last5=Eklund | first5=Julie A | title=Moisture dynamics in walls: Response to microenvironment and climate change| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=467 | issue=2125 | pages=194\u2013211 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0131| doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nA review of data and publications commissioned by the Property Care Association and carried out by the University of Portsmouth <ref name=\"A Review of Rising Damp in Masonry Buildings\"/> concluded that \"Rising damp is an age-old and ubiquitous problem.\" It also noted that \"Records on observation and descriptions on this phenomenon date back to early times. It was identified as a public health issue in the second half of the 19th Century.\" The review looked at data and studies on rising damp from a number of countries including the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, and Malaysia.\n\n===Diagnosis of rising damp===\n[[File:Rising-damp-wall.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wall affected by rising damp|A wall affected by rising damp.]]\nThe first step in assessing damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, the next step is to look for the presence of a damp-proof course.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> If a damp-proof course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nOne indicator that is often used to determine if the source of dampness is rising damp (rather than other forms of dampness) is to look for the presence of salts&nbsp;\u2013 in particular a tell tale \"salt band\" or \"tide mark\" at the peak of the damp's rise. This is not a reliable method as salts and dampness can enter the fabric of the wall in other ways&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. unwashed sea sand or gravel used in the construction of the wall.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nIf there is no damp-proof course and rising damp is suspected (tide mark, moisture confined to lower section of wall etc.&nbsp;...) then a number of diagnostic techniques can be used to determine the source of dampness. BRE Digest 245 states that the most satisfactory approach is to obtain samples of mortar in the affected wall using a drill and then analysing these samples to determine their moisture and salt content to assist in providing appropriate remedial building solutions.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The fact that this technique is destructive to the wall finish often makes it unacceptable to homeowners. It is for this reason that electrical moisture meters are often used when surveying for rising damp. These instruments are unable to accurately measure the moisture content of masonry, as they were developed for use on timber, but the reading patterns that are achieved can provide useful indicators of the source of dampness.<ref name=\"Graham Coleman\"/>\n\n===Rising damp treatment===\nIn many cases, damp is caused by \"bridging\" of a damp-proof course that is otherwise working effectively. For example, a flower bed next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled up against the wall above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the flower bed to below DPC level.\n\nWhere a rising damp problem is caused by a lack of a damp-proof course (common in buildings over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed damp-proof course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include:\n* Replacement physical damp proof course\n* Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)\n* Damp-proofing rods\n* Porous tubes / other evaporative\n* Land drainage\n* Electrical-osmotic systems\n\n====Replacement physical damp proof course====\n[[File:Brickwork 8.png|thumb|right|An example of a damp proof course of slate in a brick wall intended to prevent rising damp]]\nA physical damp proof course made from plastic can be installed into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the damp proof course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment.\n\n====Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)====\nInjection of a liquid or cream into bricks or mortar is the most common method of treating rising damp.\n\nLiquid-injection products were introduced in the 1950s and were typically installed using funnels (gravity feed method) or pressured injection pumps. The effectiveness of liquid injection damp proofing products is dependent on the type of formulation and the skill of the installer. In practice injection times tend to be lower than those required to provide a damp proof course of optimum effectiveness. A paper published in Building and Environment in 1990 made the following calculations about injection times:\n\n{{quote|The results of these calculations for a range of bricks and one building stone suggest that when high pressure injection is used the time of injection is unlikely to be less than five minutes per hole and may exceed 20 minutes per hole even for relatively permeable and porous materials. The times calculated for low pressure infusion of repellents range from 8 hours to 44 hours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=I'Anson|first=S J|author2=Hoff|title=Chemical Injection Treatment for Rising Damp - II. Calculation of Injection Times|journal=Building and Environment|year=1990|volume=25|issue=1|pages=63\u201370|doi=10.1016/0360-1323(90)90042-p}}</ref>}}\n\n=====Damp-Proofing Creams=====\n[[File:Dpc-cream.jpg|thumb|Damp-proofing cream leaking from injection holes. This can make is difficult to ascertain whether sufficient cream has remained in the holes for treatment to be successful.]]\nSince the early 2000s, damp-proofing creams have taken over from liquid products due to improved ease of application. As with liquid products these are based on silane/siloxane active ingredients which line the pores of the mortar to repel damp.\n\nThe effectiveness of liquid and cream based rising damp treatments varies considerably between products due to variations in product formulations. Independent test certifications such as British Board of Agreement (BBA) certificates are available for some products, showing that they have met a minimum requirement for product performance - see [[#Damp_(structural)/Effectiveness_of_rising_damp_treatments]]\n\nAs with liquid injection systems, cream based treatments rely on the competence of the installer for treatment to be successful. Injection holes need to be fully cleared of drill dust and debris before the cream is injected, and it is often difficult to know if each injection hole has been completely filled with cream. Furthermore, damp-proofing cream can sometimes drip out of the injection holes after treatment, reducing the effectiveness of the damp-proofing treatment.\n\n====Damp-proofing rods====\n[[File:Damp-proofing rods.jpg|thumb|left|A packet of damp-proofing rods]] [[File:Damp rods in wall.jpg|thumb|right|Damp-proofing rods installed along a mortar course to treat rising damp by forming a damp-proof course (DPC)]]Damp-proofing rods use similar active ingredients to those found in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. Damp-proofing rods are available with BBA approval.\n\nThe rods are placed into holes drilled in the mortar course and the active ingredients diffuse along the mortar line before curing to form a damp-proof course.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.btpreservation.co.uk/news-item/advanced-dryrod-damp-proofing-system-arrives-yorkshire/ | title=The advanced DryRod damp proofing system arrives in Yorkshire | accessdate=26 January 2015 | website=Brick-Tie Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nDamp-proofing rods are usually supplied in 180mm lengths suitable for inserting into a 9-inch thick wall. For treating half-brick thick (4.5 inch) walls, the rods are simply cut in half.\n\nA benefit of damp-proofing rods compared with damp-proofing creams and liquids is that it is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes.\n\n====Porous tubes====\nPorous tubes are installed along a mortar course. In theory these encourage evaporation and reduce the rise of the damp. Independent test certification are available for this type of product and tests carried out by the Building Research Establishment suggest that they are effective at controlling rising damp.\n[[File:Porous-tubes-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Porous tubes used to treat rising damp are visible on the outside of this Victorian house.]]\n{{quote|Porous ceramic tubes were an early technic to produce a method of combating rising damp; in the 1920s this technique was marketed by British Knapen. Tests were written up in the Building Research Station Annual Report of 1930: 'There have been tests to determine the effect on the rate of evaporation of moisture of inclined porous clay tubes set in specimens of brickwork and natural stone. Laboratory experiments and field tests have been carried out. Results indicate an increase of evaporation of moisture results from the use of these tubes.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n====Land drainage====\nIt has been suggested that improving drainage around walls affected by rising damp can help to reduce the height of rise by reducing the amount of water available to be absorbed into the capillaries of the wall. Typically a trench would be excavated around the affected wall into which a porous pipe would be laid. The trench would then be back-filled with a porous material such as a single-sized aggregate, forming a [[French drain]].\n\nSuch a system would obviously have the practical disadvantage of being suitable only for the treatment of outside walls and would be impractical where other buildings are close by or where a building has shallow footings. Although the theory of reducing rising damp by reducing the amount of moisture in the underlying ground would appear to be sound, there is little data to suggest that it is effective in practice. Indeed, G and I Massari stated in the ICCROM publication \"Damp Buildings Old and New\" that little effect was observed with \"open trenching\" and no effect was observed with \"covered trenching.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Electrical-osmotic systems====\nThese attempt to control rising damp through the phenomenon of [[Electro-osmosis|electro osmosis]]. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that these systems can be useful in moving salts in walls <ref name=\"Ottosen\">{{cite book|first=Lisbeth|last=Ottosen |author2=Anne J Pedersen |author3=Inge Rorig-Dalgaard|title=Salt related problems in brick masonry and electrokinetic removal of salts|publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal}}</ref> there is little in the way of independent data to demonstrate effectiveness in treating rising damp. The BRE publication \"Understanding Dampness\" makes the following observations about electro osmotic systems for the treatment of rising damp:\n\n{{quote|There are two types: active and passive; neither has been approved by a recognised laboratory. By far the greater number of systems are of the passive kind, where there is no external source of electricity. They have always been something of a controversial issue. On theoretical grounds, it remains a mystery as to how they can work; their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in the laboratory and field evidence is disappointing.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n===Effectiveness of rising damp treatments===\nBRE Digest 245 suggests that with the exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. [[British Board of Agr\u00e9ment]] Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp. It then goes on to state that the only method of currently satisfying this requirement is DPC injection (liquid or cream&nbsp;\u2013 although damp-proofing rods have subsequently been made available with BBA approval) and that \"this is the only method which BRE considers suitable where insertion of a physical DPC is not possible.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveryors (RICS) publication \"Remedying Damp\" is more cautious about reliance on third party accreditation, casting doubt upon the validity of the test methods employed, arguing that trials are usually conducted using \"specially built masonry panels&nbsp;\u2013 which do not match up in many respects to walls found in real properties,\" and that \"if a DPC were proved {{em|to not}} work in a specially built masonry panel, this would be the more significant result.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\">{{cite book|first=Ralph|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=85|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref> The MOAT No 39 test<ref>{{cite book|title=The Assessment of Damp-proof Course Systems for Existing Buildings, MOAT No.39|publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment}}</ref> employed by the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) in the UK is dismissed as \"quite a clever test idea but in the author's opinion not actually replicating a real wall.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\"/> The author, Ralph Burkinshaw, has developed his own test method which he has published under the title, ''\"The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application.\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jba/journal/v6/n1/full/jba201013a.html |title=The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application. |last1=Burkinshaw |first1=Ralph |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014 the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment confirmed that it would consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates with a view to updating the MOAT No.39 test in light of the fact that it was not originally designed to test damp proofing creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBA Statement on Chemical Damp Proofing Creams |url=http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417023458/http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-17 }}</ref> This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said Damp-proofing creams differ from fluid-based damp-proofing treatments in a number of ways:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/228945025/BBA-Statement-on-Damp-Proofing-Creams|title=BBA Statement on Damp-proofing Creams - October 2013}}</ref>\n\n# Creams are applied at much lower application rates than is typical for fluid injection and are designed to spread through masonry by diffusion without the assistance of pressure injection. Owing to the number of different mortar types and moisture contents, it is necessary to test these materials under a wider range of conditions. Research undertaken by the BBA has indicated that the performance of creams differs with varying test conditions, with not all products performing well under all test conditions.\n# The amount of active material delivered per linear metre varies considerably between cream formulations. Injection systems were typically injected at an application rate of approximately 100g of active ingredient per linear metre of 275&nbsp;mm (9 inch) thick wall. However, because the strength of cream formulations used in the UK can vary widely, the applied amount of delivered active material varied from 22g to 107g per linear metre depending on product strength. As there is limited historical data on the durability of chemical creams with low levels of active material, it is difficult to draw conclusions on their life expectancy in comparison to high strength creams which have similar active material levels to injected systems.\n\nIn his book, Dampness in Buildings, Alan Oliver refers to research carried out in Belgium regarding the effectiveness of different types of rising damp treatments:\n\n{{quote|In Belgium, at the Centre Scientifique et Technique de la Construction (CTSC, 1985), research was carried out on the effectiveness of the main retrofit DPCs found in Europe. It was generally found that physical DPCs performed best, followed by the various chemical DPCs, with electro osmosis and atmospheric syphons being the least effective.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Oliver|title=Dampness in Buildings - Second Edition|publisher=Blackwall Science|page=206|isbn=0-632-04085-8|date=1997-01-30}}</ref>}}\n\n===Replastering===\nReplastering will often be carried out as part of a rising damp treatment. Where plaster has become severely damaged by ground salts there is little argument about the need to replaster. However, there is considerable debate about:\n\n# The extent of replastering required\n# The use of hard sand:cement renders to replaster as part of a rising damp treatment\n\n[[File:Plaster-removed-rising-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaster removed from a wall as part of a rising damp treatment. The wall was replastered using a sand-cement render.]]\n\nBS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\">{{cite book|title=BS6576:2005, Code of practice for diagnosis of rising damp in walls of buildings and installation of chemical damp proof courses|publisher=BSI|page=9|isbn=0-580-46867-4}}</ref> states that \"the function of the new plaster is to prevent hygroscopic salts that might be present in the wall from migrating through to its surface, while still allowing the wall to dry.\" However, writing in the RICS publication \"Remedying Damp\", Ralph Burkinshaw claims that, \"the plaster is really there for {{em|two}} main reasons.\" He accepts the need for replastering when significant amounts of ground salts have built up in the existing plaster, but he then goes on to say that replastering is often carried out to make up for an unreliable chemical DPC. He also suggests that damp-proofers have an incentive to carry out more replastering than is strictly necessary as it allows them to finish the job without having to wait for walls to dry out, resulting in faster payment.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=81|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sand-cement-render.jpg|thumbnail|left|Application of a sand:cement render to a wall as part of a rising damp treatment]]\nAlthough the sand-cement renders typically installed as part of a rising damp treatment are very effective at holding back damp and ground salts, they have a number of disadvantages. These include an incompatibility with the soft bricks and mortars encountered in older buildings and a lack of insulation properties compared with more traditional plasters, resulting in an increased risk of condensation. Replastering is also one of the most expensive parts of a rising damp treatment.\n\nPorous renders to German WTA specification 2-2-91 can be used as an alternative to dense sand-cement renders. These have a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume. Salts crystallise in these pores rather than on the plaster surface, avoiding decorative spoiling. Such plasters offer a better solution than dense sand-cement renders when used on moderately salt-contaminated walls as their porous nature gives them insulation properties, resulting in a warmer surface temperature and making condensation problems less likely to occur. However, when used on heavily salt contaminated walls they may need to be replaced frequently as they lose effectiveness once all the pores have become filled with crystallised salt.<ref>WTA Merkblatt 2-6-99/D. Endg\u00fcltige Fassung Juli 2001 - {{ISBN|978-3-8167-6794-7}}</ref> The \"Renovation Mortars\" described in EN998-1:2003<ref>{{cite book|title=BS EN 998-1:2003 Specification for mortar for masonry - Part 1:Rendering and plastering mortar|publisher=British Standards Institution |page=7|isbn=0-580-42780-3}}</ref> are described as being designed for use on \"moist masonry walls containing soluble salts.\" The performance requirements for these types of mortars are based on German WTA specification 2-2-91 but without the requirement for a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume.\n\nMore recently, systems have become available that allow plasterboard or insulation board to be used to replaster walls affected by rising damp. After the existing plaster has been hacked off the wall, a salt and moisture retardant cream is applied to the wall. The plasterboard is then applied to the wall using a salt/moisture-proof adhesive. Such systems have the advantage that they can be decorated straight away, rather than having to wait several days or weeks (as would be the case with standard plasters). They also provide a warmer surface that is less prone to condensation than would be the case with a standard sand:cement render.\n\nReplastering may not be necessary where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\"/> states that \"Where the plaster appears to be in sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete.\" Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial damp-proof course will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the damp-proofing system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out.\n\n====Redecoration====\nIt is best practice to delay replastering and redecoration for as long as possible following rising damp treatment, but this obviously creates inconvenience to the occupants of the affected building. BRE Digest 245 states that \"While the wall should be allowed to dry for as long as possible, replastering can follow, providing porous decorations are selected. These are usually matt emulsions and water-based paints, both of which will allow the wall to breathe. Application of gloss and vinyl paints or wallpapers should be delayed for at least one year.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nPlasterboard-based replastering systems have the advantage that immediate redecoration is possible irrespective of which decorative finish is chosen.\n\nDue to the fact that rising damp often co-exists with other forms of dampness such as condensation, the use of a mould resistant emulsion paint is often recommended.\n\n===In popular culture===\nIn [[Calling All Cars (The Sopranos)|''The Sopranos'' episode \"Calling All Cars\"]], [[Janice Soprano]] adopts the identity \"Rising Damp\" (along with the AOL username \"Vlad666\") to instant message [[Bobby Baccalieri]]'s children, Little Bobby and Sophia, who are grieving for their newly departed mother, and to direct them to communicate further via [[Ouija board]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling All Cars (4.11) |website= Sopranos Autopsy|url=https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* Institute of Specialist Surveyors and Engineers (ISSE - UK) [http://www.isse.org.uk The UK - based international institute specialising in structural damp, committed to creating & raising standards and representing the highest of standards within this industry]\n* Howell, Jeff.
