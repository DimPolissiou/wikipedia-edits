The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century eclipse<!--Different word should be used-->, from the 1950s the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious addresses<!--The entire road? Maybe location?-->.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}}.<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref>Through these streets, towards the bottleneck of the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]], [[procession]]s squeezed through almost daily since the [[Middle Ages]]<!--Until when?-->. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge. As an unintended consequence<!--Is it? I'm assuming here-->, the bridge connected the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century eclipse<!--Different word should be used-->, from the 1950s the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious addresses<!--The entire road? Maybe location?-->.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}}.<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref>Through these streets, towards the bottleneck of the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]], [[procession]]s squeezed through almost daily since the [[Middle Ages]]<!--Until when?-->. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge. As an unintended consequence<!--Is it? I'm assuming here-->, the bridge connected the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]],  Julius II implemented many projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae''), a task which was started forty years before<!--What year?--> by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484), in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]''.<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref>One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new representative<!--I feel like this is lost in translation; is it similar to ''strada nazionale''?--> street through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.

{"title_page": "Penal Code of Argentina", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2018}}\n \n'''The Argentine Penal Code''' is the law that governs crimes and its sanction in the Argentine Republic.\n\n== Background ==\n'''Hispanic period'''\nBefore and after 1810, until the initiation of the codification of criminal law with the Tejedor Project, the exclusive source of the repressive legislation in force in the territory of the R\u00edo de la Plata, which for the most part became the United Provinces and then that of the Argentine Republic, were the Spanish penal laws prior to the Penal Code of 1822. The new Compilation, the Laws of the Indies, The Parties, the Jurisdiction, the Laws of Bull and the Newly Compiled1, which constitute that source, reflected the reception of Roman and canon law.\n\n'''May revolution'''\nAs of 1810, together with the Spanish laws that subsisted as common repressive legislation, special laws governed, mostly with local validity in the different provinces. The most important law of national scope was n\u00ba 49 (14-09-1863) that designated the crimes whose judgment competed with the national courts and established its penalty. This law, recognizing the power of the provinces to dictate their own penal codes, declared them to be supplementary in respect of crimes against the Nation not foreseen in it and common crimes committed in the places subject to their jurisdiction (Article 93). He thus acknowledged, in an express way, the double source of common criminal law existing at that time in the country.\n\n'''The Project of Carlos Tejedor'''\nFirst attempt of general criminal codification, was written by commission of the National Executive Power (05-12-1864), by [[Carlos Tejedor (politician)|Carlos Tejedor]], professor of the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. In the general provisions of its General Part, the Project follows, to a great extent, the Bavarian Penal Code of 1813, the work of [[Paul Johann Anselm von Feuerbach|Paul Johann Anselm Von Feuerbach]]. To a lesser extent he received the contribution of the Spanish doctrine through [[Joaqu\u00edn Francisco Pacheco y Guti\u00e9rrez-Calder\u00f3n|Joaqu\u00edn Francisco Pacheco]], commentator of the Spanish Code of 1848/50 and of the French doctrine through Chauveau. In Part Two, the Peruvian code of 1862 and the aforementioned Spanish predominate as immediate sources. The Tejedor Project was not sanctioned as a national code, but by virtue of the authorization granted by art. 108 of the National Constitution, was adopted as a criminal code by eleven provinces, with some modifications made in Buenos Aires. It represents, through the 1886 code, an important precedent of many provisions of the current code.\n\n'''The project of 1881'''\nIn the Project of 1881 (03-01-1880), written by Sixto Villegas, Andr\u00e9s Ugarriza and Juan A. Garc\u00eda, in charge of examining the Tejedor Project by the National Executive Power, the influence of the Spanish Code of 1870 predominates. C\u00f3rdoba adopted it as a penal code, with some modifications (14-08-1882). Presented this project to the Chamber of Deputies (11-05-1881) was not accepted.\n\n== The Code of 1886 ==\nThe first Penal Code for the Nation (Law 1920 - 07-12-1886) was sanctioned by Congress on the basis of the Tejedor project and came into force on February 1, 1887. It does not include criminal legislation in its entirety, but rather that leaves to the margin, contained in the Law n\u00ba 49, the federal legislation on crimes and crimes against the Nation.\n\n'''The reform of 1890'''\nOn June 7, 1890, the National Executive Power commissioned Norberto Pi\u00f1ero, Rodolfo Rivarola and Jos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s Matienzo to plan the reform of the Code. The Project, presented in June 1891, legislated on national crimes and misdemeanors, unified the common criminal legislation. In addition to reviewing the list of crimes of the 1886 Code, it filled its gaps regarding the application of criminal law in space. He kept the sources of Spanish origin. This Project presented the preponderant contribution of the Italian codes of 1889, Hungarian of 1878, Dutch of 1881 and Belgian of 1867, which contained the latest and best criminal legislation. Your text is a valuable precedent for interpreting the original text of the current code. The 1891 Project, which only obtained a favorable opinion from the Committee of Deputies, served as the basis for the reforms introduced in the 1886 Code by Law 4,189 (09/21/1903). Opinion, especially from the positivists, was adverse to the reform.\n\n'''1906 reform project'''\nFaced with the situation described above, the Executive Power ordered the revision of the 1886 Code by a commission formed, in addition to Pi\u00f1ero and Rivarola, drafters of the 1891 Project, by F. Beagley, D. Saavedra, Moyano Gacit\u00faa and Ramos Mej\u00eda (09 -12-1904). The Project that is denominated of 1906, and was presented to the National Executive Power, on March 10 of that year and sent to the Congress on September 1, follows the orientation of 1891. The Deputy Rodolfo Moreno (h) was the one who gave the last impulse to the long reform process of the 1886 Code. With some modifications. He presented the reform project of 1906, on which a commission of deputies, headed by Moreno, drafted the 1917 Project. It only legislated on crimes. It was criticized by the positivist sector, \"because it makes a clean slate of the crimes of the advances produced in criminal law during the twentieth century.\n\n== The code of 1921 ==\nThe 1917 Project, which was subject to reforms in the Senate that did not alter its structure, was sanctioned as a Criminal Code on September 30, 1921. It was promulgated as Law 11,179 on October 29 of the same year and entered into force as of April 30, 1922. This Code, born in full swing of the Positive School in the country, in its first quarter of the century was the subject of more critical consideration than a positive interpretation. Incorporated into positive law institutions such as: probation and conditional condemnation, the measures applicable to those charged, minors and recidivists, as well as the extenuating and aggravating of the penalty.\n\n'''Reform projects after 1921'''\nThere have been numerous projects of reforms to the Code among others, the partial ones on the dangerous state of 1924, 1926, 1928 and 1932 and the one of the senate of 1933 and those of total reform of Coll - Gomez (1936), of positivist orientation; de Peco (1941), neo - positivist and with an important Statement of Motives; 1951, authoritarian and positivist; and that of 1960, written by Soler and reviewed by an advisory commission. After the Project of 1960, came the one of 1963, drafted by a commission appointed by the Executive Power; the 1973 draft, prepared by the commission designated by ministerial resolution of 19-12-2000, adopted by a subcommission, which in general departs less from the Criminal Code than the two previous ones. Finally there are the Soler Project of 1979 (Soler - Aguirre Cabral and Rizzi) and the one that in 1994 propitiated the Executive Power, on the basis of the innovations suggested by Professor Eugenio Ra\u00fal Zaffaroni in his preliminary draft of reforms submitted to the Ministry of Justice of the Nation on August 15, 1991. As of that year, the Penal Code, although it has resisted the multiple attempts of general reform, has suffered them to a great extent, through laws, decrees - laws and the so-called laws . Law 17,567 (of January 12, 1968) reformed the Penal Code, inspired by the Soler Project. Law 21,338 (of June 25, 1976) restored all the reforms that Law 17,567 made to the Penal Code in 1967. Finally, the National Congress, through Law 23,077, of August 27, 1984, restored the most of the texts of Law 11,179.\n\n== Systematization ==\nThe Criminal Code consists of two books:\n'''Book one, general provisions'''\nIt is the general part of the code and it describes the legal principles that will govern, consists of 13 titles that deal with:\nTITLE I\nApplication of criminal law Arts.1 to 4\nTITLE II\nOf the penalties Arts. 5 to 25\nTITLE III\nConditional condemnation Arts. 26 to 29\nTITLE IV\nRepair of damages Arts. 30 to 33\nTITLE V\nImputability Arts. 34 to 41\nTITLE VI\nArts Attempt 42 to 44\nTITLE VII\nCriminal participation Arts. 45 to 49\nTITLE VIII\nRecidivism Arts. 50 to 53\nTITLE IX\nArts Crimes Contest. 54 to 58\nTITLE X\nExtinction of actions and penalties Arts. 59 to 70\nTITLE XI\nOf the exercise of the actions Arts. 71 to 76\nTITLE XII\nFrom the suspension of the trial to trial Arts. 76 bis to 76 quater\nTITLE XIII\nSignificance of the concepts used in the Arts code. 77 to 78 bis\n'''Book two, of crimes'''\n\nIt is the special part of the code and it describes all the crimes in their different modalities and the corresponding criminal graduation, consists of 13 titles and a section of complementary provisions that deal with:\nTITLE I\nCrimes against people Arts. 79 to 108\nTITLE II\nCrimes against honor Arts. 109 a 117 bis\nTITLE III\nCrimes against sexual integrity Arts. 118 to 133\nTITLE IV\nCrimes against civil status Arts. 134 a 139 bis\nTITLE V\nCrimes against freedom Arts. 140 to 161\nTITLE VI\nCrimes against property Arts. 162 to 185\nTITLE VII\nCrimes against public safety Arts. 186 to 208\nTITLE VIII\nCrimes against public order Arts. 209 to 213 bis\nTITLE IX\nCrimes against the security of the Nation Arts. 214 to 225\nTITLE X\nCrimes against the public powers and the constitutional order Arts. 226 to 236\nTITLE XI\nCrimes against public administration Arts. 237 a 281 bis\nTITLE XII\nCrimes against the public faith Arts. 282 to 302\nTITLE XIII\nCrimes against the economic and financial order Art. 303 to 313\nCOMPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS\nArts. 303 to 305\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/15000-19999/16546/texact.htm Penal Code of Argentina]\n\n\n\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Legal codes of Argentina|Penal]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2018}}\n \n'''The Argentine Penal Code''' is the law that governs crimes and its sanction in the Argentine Republic.\n\n== Background ==\n'''Hispanic period'''\nBefore and after 1810, until the initiation of the codification of criminal law with the Tejedor Project, the exclusive source of the repressive legislation in force in the territory of the R\u00edo de la Plata, which for the most part became the United Provinces and then that of the Argentine Republic, were the Spanish penal laws prior to the Penal Code of 1822.

His father wished him to enter business, but he was eventually (by 1848) able to enroll in the Medical School of [[University College London]]. He obtained his medical degree in 1851 with the highest honours in [[anatomy]] and surgery.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1853 he was appointed assistant surgeon at [[University College Hospital]], becoming full surgeon in 1863, professor of clinical surgery in 1866, and consulting surgeon in 1874. In 1884 he became professor of surgery and pathology in the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. Specializing in surgery of the [[genito-urinary tract]], and in particular in that of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], he studied in Paris under [[Jean Civiale]], who in the first quarter of the 19th century had developed a procedure to crush a [[Kidney stone|stone]] within the human bladder and who had invented an instrument for this [[minimally invasive]] surgery.\n\nAfter his return from Paris, Thompson soon acquired a reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:SirHenryThompsonBt.jpg|thumb|right|Thompson in a portrait painted by [[John Everett Millais]]]]\nIn 1863, when King [[Leopold I of Belgium]] was suffering from [[kidney stones]], Thompson was called to [[Brussels]] to consult in the case, and after some difficulties was allowed to perform the operation of [[lithotripsy]]. It was successful, and in recognition of his skill Thompson was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the King,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Sir Henry Thompson|journal=Medical Press and Circular|year=1904|volume=77|page=463|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UxoCAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=28 June 2008}}</ref> an appointment which was continued by [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]]. Nearly ten years later Thompson carried out a similar operation on the former Emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]]; however, the Emperor died four days after, not from the surgical procedure, as was proved by the [[autopsy|post-mortem examination]], but from [[uremia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1874 Thompson helped in founding the ''[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]'', of which he was the first president; he also did much toward the removal of the legal restrictions on [[cremation]]. He denounced the prevailing methods of [[death certificate|death certification]] in Great Britain; and in 1892 a select committee was appointed to inquire into the matter; its report, published the following year, was generally in line with his thinking. [[Woking Crematorium]] finally became the first of its kind in the UK. Thompson's last public duty for the society, in 1903, was to open [[Birmingham Crematorium]],<ref name=\"CSGB-History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html|title=History of the Society|date=1 January 1999|publisher=[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]|accessdate=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224133412/http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html|archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref> the country's ninth.<ref name=\"Dignity-110\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dignityfunerals.co.uk/crematoria/index.asp?pageid=17&storyid=41|title=Birmingham Crematorium commemorates 110th anniversary|publisher=Dignity plc|accessdate=21 December 2013}}</ref> He died in April 1904; his body was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html#thompson|title=History of the Society: Death of Sir Henry Thompson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]|accessdate=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224133412/http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html#thompson|archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref> the first in London, which he had opened in 1902.<ref name=\"garden\">{{NHLE|num=1001575 |desc=Golders Green Crematorium |accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Carlo Pellegrini by Sir Henry Thompson.jpg|thumb|right|Thompson's portrait of [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]]]]\nThompson was also an artist, producing sketches and paintings, some of which were hung at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the [[Paris Salon]]. About 1870 he began to collect Chinese [[porcelain]], in particular of old blue and white [[Nanking]]; in time his collection became so large that he could no longer find room for it, and most of it was sold. A catalogue of it, illustrated by himself and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], was published in 1878.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe was also interested in [[astronomy]], and for a time maintained a private [[observatory]] in his house at [[Molesey]]. He presented the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] several instruments, including a photographic [[heliograph]] of 9-inch [[aperture]]; a 30-inch [[reflecting telescope]], and a large [[refracting telescope]] with a 26-inch object glass (of 22 feet [[focal length]]). The offer of the last instrument was made in 1894. Its manufacture was undertaken by [[Howard Grubb|Sir Howard Grubb]] of Dublin, and its erection was completed in 1897.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nSir Henry Thompson, [[knight]]ed in 1867, received a [[baronet]]cy in 1899, in connection with his telescope gifts to the National Observatory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1851 he married [[Kate Loder]], a pianist, who was stricken with [[paralysis]] soon afterwards. On his death, his only son, [[Henry Francis Herbert Thompson|Herbert]], a [[barrister]] and [[Egyptologist]], succeeded to the baronetcy. Of his two daughters, the elder (author of a valuable ''Handbook to the Public Picture Galleries of Europe'', first published in 1877) married [[Henry William Watkins]], [[Archdeacon of Durham]].  The younger daughter, Frances (Sophia) Cornwall Thompson, married the Rev. [[Henry de Candole]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  the only sibling of the WW1 poet [[Alec de Candole]]<ref>http://www.spanglefish.com/AlecdeCandole</ref>  They had no children.\n\n==Debate over vegetarianism==\n\nThompson was incorrectly cited and misquoted by vegetarians as being a supporter of [[vegetarianism]].<ref>{{cite journal|year=1898|title=The Anti-Kreophagists|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1953|pages=1475-1476}}</ref> For example, he is cited as supporting a vegetarian diet in [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s essay ''The Superiority of Vegetarianism''. Thompson rejected excessive meat consumption and promoted a \"lighter\" diet but was not a vegetarian. He was involved in a debate over vegetarianism which led to controversy in the ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'' magazine.<ref>Gregory, James. (2007). ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians: The Vegetarian Movement in Nineteenth-Century Britain''.

His father wished him to enter business, but he was eventually (by 1848) able to enroll in the Medical School of [[University College London]]. He obtained his medical degree in 1851 with the highest honours in [[anatomy]] and surgery.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1853 he was appointed assistant surgeon at [[University College Hospital]], becoming full surgeon in 1863, professor of clinical surgery in 1866, and consulting surgeon in 1874. In 1884 he became professor of surgery and pathology in the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. Specializing in surgery of the [[genito-urinary tract]], and in particular in that of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], he studied in Paris under [[Jean Civiale]], who in the first quarter of the 19th century had developed a procedure to crush a [[Kidney stone|stone]] within the human bladder and who had invented an instrument for this [[minimally invasive]] surgery.\n\nAfter his return from Paris, Thompson soon acquired a reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:SirHenryThompsonBt.jpg|thumb|right|Thompson in a portrait painted by [[John Everett Millais]]]]\nIn 1863, when King [[Leopold I of Belgium]] was suffering from [[kidney stones]], Thompson was called to [[Brussels]] to consult in the case, and after some difficulties was allowed to perform the operation of [[lithotripsy]]. It was successful, and in recognition of his skill Thompson was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the King,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Sir Henry Thompson|journal=Medical Press and Circular|year=1904|volume=77|page=463|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UxoCAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=28 June 2008}}</ref> an appointment which was continued by [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]]. Nearly ten years later Thompson carried out a similar operation on the former Emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]]; however, the Emperor died four days after, not from the surgical procedure, as was proved by the [[autopsy|post-mortem examination]], but from [[uremia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1874 Thompson helped in founding the ''[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]'', of which he was the first president; he also did much toward the removal of the legal restrictions on [[cremation]]. He denounced the prevailing methods of [[death certificate|death certification]] in Great Britain; and in 1892 a select committee was appointed to inquire into the matter; its report, published the following year, was generally in line with his thinking. [[Woking Crematorium]] finally became the first of its kind in the UK.

About 1870 he began to collect Chinese [[porcelain]], in particular of old blue and white [[Nanking]]; in time his collection became so large that he could no longer find room for it, and most of it was sold. A catalogue of it, illustrated by himself and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], was published in 1878.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe was also interested in [[astronomy]], and for a time maintained a private [[observatory]] in his house at [[Molesey]]. He presented the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] several instruments, including a photographic [[heliograph]] of 9-inch [[aperture]]; a 30-inch [[reflecting telescope]], and a large [[refracting telescope]] with a 26-inch object glass (of 22 feet [[focal length]]). The offer of the last instrument was made in 1894. Its manufacture was undertaken by [[Howard Grubb|Sir Howard Grubb]] of Dublin, and its erection was completed in 1897.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nSir Henry Thompson, [[knight]]ed in 1867, received a [[baronet]]cy in 1899, in connection with his telescope gifts to the National Observatory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1851 he married [[Kate Loder]], a pianist, who was stricken with [[paralysis]] soon afterwards. On his death, his only son, [[Henry Francis Herbert Thompson|Herbert]], a [[barrister]] and [[Egyptologist]], succeeded to the baronetcy. Of his two daughters, the elder (author of a valuable ''Handbook to the Public Picture Galleries of Europe'', first published in 1877) married [[Henry William Watkins]], [[Archdeacon of Durham]].  The younger daughter, Frances (Sophia) Cornwall Thompson, married the Rev.

Thompson rejected excessive meat consumption and promoted a \"lighter\" diet but was not a vegetarian. He was involved in a debate over vegetarianism which led to controversy in the ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'' magazine.<ref>Gregory, James. (2007).
