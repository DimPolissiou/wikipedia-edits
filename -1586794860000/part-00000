The Saints aimed to retain their [[FAI Cup]], [[President of Ireland's Cup|President's Cup]] and [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]] titles that were won during the [[2014 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2014 season]]. Pats also competed in the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] and the [[2015 League of Ireland Cup|EA Sports Cup]]. The [[2015 League of Ireland]] fixtures were released on 16 December 2014, with the Saints' first game being an away fixture against [[South Dublin]] rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 6 March 2015.<ref name=\"stpatsfc1\">http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=6587</ref> The season turned out to be a very disappointing one for players, management and fans alike as the Saints finished of way off the top of the league, only securing European football on the final day, were knocked out of the [[FAI Cup]] at the early stages and failed to get past the first hurdle in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. However they did win the [[2015 League of Ireland Cup]] on penalties versus [[Galway United F.C. (2013)|Galway United]] on 19 September 2015, completing the set of trophies for manager [[Liam Buckley]], meaning he has won every trophy possible to win with the Saints in the last three seasons. During the season, the team also set a club record winning streak in the league that stretched 9 games, beating the previous record of 8.\n\n==Squad==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Name\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Position(s)\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white; width:55px;\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Hometown\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Date of Birth (Age)\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Previous Club\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Year Signed\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Club Apps.\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Club Goals\n|-\n! colspan=\"14\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Goalkeepers\n|-\n|1||[[Brendan Clarke]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|IRL}}||[[Celbridge]], [[County Kildare|Kildare]]||{{Birth date and age|1985|9|17|df=y}}||{{flagicon|IRL}} [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]]\n||[[2012 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2012]]||169||0\n|-\n|16||[[Conor O'Malley]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|IRL}}||[[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]]||{{Birth date and age|1994|8|1|df=y}}||{{flagicon|IRL}} [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.

It was the fourth year that [[Liam Buckley]] was the teams manager (in his current spell), following replacing [[Pete Mahon]] in December 2011. The Saints aimed to retain their [[FAI Cup]], [[President of Ireland's Cup|President's Cup]] and [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]] titles that were won during the [[2014 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2014 season]]. Pats also competed in the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] and the [[2015 League of Ireland Cup|EA Sports Cup]]. The [[2015 League of Ireland]] fixtures were released on 16 December 2014, with the Saints' first game being an away fixture against [[South Dublin]] rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 6 March 2015.<ref name=\"stpatsfc1\">http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=6587</ref> The season turned out to be a very disappointing one for players, management and fans alike as the Saints finished of way off the top of the league, only securing European football on the final day, were knocked out of the [[FAI Cup]] at the early stages and failed to get past the first hurdle in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. However they did win the [[2015 League of Ireland Cup]] on penalties versus [[Galway United F.C. (2013)|Galway United]] on 19 September 2015, completing the set of trophies for manager [[Liam Buckley]], meaning he has won every trophy possible to win with the Saints in the last three seasons. During the season, the team also set a club record winning streak in the league that stretched 9 games, beating the previous record of 8.\n\n==Squad==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Name\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Position(s)\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white; width:55px;\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Hometown\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Date of Birth (Age)\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Previous Club\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Year Signed\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Club Apps.\n! style=\"background:#d50000; color:white;\"| Club Goals\n|-\n! colspan=\"14\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Goalkeepers\n|-\n|1||[[Brendan Clarke]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|IRL}}||[[Celbridge]], [[County Kildare|Kildare]]||{{Birth date and age|1985|9|17|df=y}}||{{flagicon|IRL}} [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]]\n||[[2012 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2012]]||169||0\n|-\n|16||[[Conor O'Malley]]||[[Goalkeeper (association football)|GK]]||{{flagicon|IRL}}||[[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]]||{{Birth date and age|1994|8|1|df=y}}||{{flagicon|IRL}} [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.

There he befriends [[Norman Bates]] and ends up inheriting the Bates Motel. It was originally produced as a [[television pilot|pilot]] for a proposed TV series set in the Bates Motel, but it was not picked up by the network.\n\n==Plot==\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) at the state lunatic asylum nearly twenty years for killing his abusive stepfather, and they became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest.\n\nAlex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by.
