Chewing gum was causing maintenance problems in high-rise [[Housing and Development Board|public-housing]] apartments, with vandals disposing of spent gum in mailboxes, inside keyholes, and on lift buttons. Chewing gum left on the ground, stairways, and pavements in public areas increased the cost of cleaning and damaged cleaning equipment. Gum stuck on the seats of public buses was also considered a problem. However, Lee thought that a ban would be \"too drastic\".\n\n===Mass rapid transport and implementation===\nIn 1987, the $5 billion local railway system, the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT), started running. It was then the largest public project ever implemented in Singapore.\n\nIt was reported that vandals had begun sticking chewing gum on the door sensors of MRT trains, preventing doors from functioning properly and causing disruption to train services. Such incidents were rare but costly and culprits were difficult to apprehend. In January 1992, [[Goh Chok Tong]], who had just taken over as Prime Minister, decided on a ban. The restriction on the distribution of chewing gum was enacted in Singapore Statute Chapter 57, the ''Control of Manufacture Act'', which also governs the restriction of certain [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] products.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CMA1959 | title=Control of Manufacture Act - Singapore Statutes Online | access-date=2018-04-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405153243/https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CMA1959 | archive-date=2018-04-05 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n\nAfter the ban was announced, the import of chewing gum was immediately halted. After a transition period allowing shops to clear existing stock, the sale of chewing gum was completely banned.\n\nWhen first introduced, the ban caused much controversy and some open defiance. Some people took the trouble of travelling to neighbouring [[Johor Bahru]], [[Malaysia]], to purchase chewing gum. Offenders were publicly \"named and shamed\" by the government, to serve as a deterrent to other would-be smugglers. No [[black market]] for chewing gum in Singapore ever emerged, though some Singaporeans occasionally still manage to smuggle some chewing gum from Johor Bahru for their own consumption. The ban has been partially lifted, as some types of gum are allowable, such as gum chewed for dental health. However, the government refuses to completely lift the ban due to the risk of gum littering again.\n\n==International attention==\nIn the mid 1990s, Singapore's laws began to receive international press coverage. US media paid great attention to the case of [[Michael P. Fay]], an American teenager sentenced in 1994 to [[caning]] in Singapore for [[vandalism]] (using spray paint, not chewing gum). They also drew attention to some of Singapore's other laws, including the \"mandatory flushing of public toilets\" rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32090420|title=Why Singapore banned chewing gum - BBC News|last=Metz|first=Elle|date=28 March 2015|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=31 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701044729/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32090420|archivedate=1 July 2016}}</ref> Confused reporting about these issues led to the myth that the use or importation of chewing gum is itself punishable with caning.

More broadly, there was the loss of a central role of the British Empire: the defence of the Empire. That role was no longer militarily or financially feasible, as [[Truman Doctrine|Britain's withdrawal from Greece in 1947]] had painfully demonstrated. Britain itself was now just one part of the [[NATO]] military alliance in which the Commonwealth had no role apart from Canada. The ANZUS treaty of 1955 linked Australia, New Zealand, and the [[United States of America|United States]] in a defensive alliance, with Britain and the Commonwealth left out. The second major function of the Empire made London the financial centre of the system. After the Second World War, the British treasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the United States. The loss of defence and financial roles, furthermore, undermined [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph Chamberlain's]] early 20th century vision of a world empire that could combine Imperial preference, mutual defence, and social growth. Furthermore, Britain's cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly limited, especially with the losses of India and Singapore.<ref>Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951\u20141970'', p. 103.</ref> While British politicians at first hoped the Commonwealth would preserve and project British influence, they gradually lost their enthusiasm, argues Krishnan Srinivasan. Early enthusiasm waned as British policies came under fire at Commonwealth meetings. Public opinion became troubled as immigration from non-white member states became large-scale.<ref>Krishnan Srinivasan,  \"Nobody's Commonwealth?

The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers' meeting in London. Under the [[London Declaration]], [[India]] agreed that, when it became a republic in January 1950, it would accept the British Sovereign as a \"symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth\". Upon hearing this, King [[George VI]] told the Indian politician [[Krishna Menon]]: \"So, I've become 'as such'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/staying-loyal-to-george/581730/0|title=Staying loyal to George|work=indianexpress.com}}</ref> The other Commonwealth countries recognised India's continuing membership of the association.

Following India's precedent, other nations became republics, or [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] with their own monarchs. While some countries retained the same monarch as the United Kingdom, their monarchies developed differently and soon became essentially independent of the British monarchy.

It is responsible to member governments collectively. The Commonwealth of Nations is represented in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] by the secretariat as an [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]]. The secretariat organises Commonwealth summits, meetings of ministers, consultative meetings and technical discussions; it assists policy development and provides policy advice, and facilitates multilateral communication among the member governments. It also provides technical assistance to help governments in the social and economic development of their countries and in support of the Commonwealth's fundamental political values.<ref name=\"Paxton, 1978\">Cook and Paxton, ''Commonwealth Political Facts'' (1978) part 3.</ref>\n\nThe secretariat is headed by the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] who is elected by [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Commonwealth heads of government]] for no more than two four-year terms. The secretary-general and two deputy secretaries-general direct the divisions of the Secretariat. The present secretary-general is [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal]], from [[Dominica]], who took office on 1 April 2016, succeeding [[Kamalesh Sharma]] of [[India]] (2008\u20132016). The first secretary-general was [[Arnold Smith]] of [[Canada]] (1965\u201375), followed by Sir [[Shridath Ramphal]] of [[Guyana]] (1975\u201390), Chief [[Emeka Anyaoku]] of [[Nigeria]] (1990\u201399), and [[Don McKinnon]] of [[New Zealand]] (2000\u20132008).<ref name=\"Paxton, 1978\" />\n\n=== Commonwealth citizenship and high commissioners ===\n{{Main|Commonwealth citizen|High commissioner (Commonwealth)}}\n\nIn recognition of their shared heritage and culture, Commonwealth countries are not considered to be \"foreign\" to each other,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=William|date=July 1982|title=Is the Commonwealth an International Organisation?|journal=[[International and Comparative Law Quarterly]]|volume=31|issue=3|pages=451\u201373|doi=10.1093/iclqaj/31.3.451}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Clute|first1=Robert E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Robert R.|date=July 1958|title=Commonwealth and Favored-Nation Usage|journal=[[American Journal of International Law]]|volume=52|issue=3|pages=455\u2013468|doi=10.2307/2195461|jstor=2195461}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hedley|first=Bull|date=July 1959|title=What is the Commonwealth?|journal=[[World Politics]]|volume=11|issue=4|pages=577\u201387|doi=10.2307/2009593|jstor=2009593}}</ref> although the technical extent of this concept varies in different countries.

The first of these was set out in 1961, when it was decided that respect for [[racial equality]] would be a requirement for membership, leading directly to the withdrawal of South Africa's re-application (which they were required to make under the formula of the London Declaration upon becoming a republic).

Foreign exchange reserves were pooled in London, to be used to fight the war.  In effect Britain procured \u00a32.3&nbsp;billion, of which \u00a31.3&nbsp;billion was from India.  The debt was held in the form of British government securities and became known as \"sterling balances\". By 1950, India, Pakistan and Ceylon had spent much of their sterling, while other countries accumulated more. The sterling area that included all of the Commonwealth except for Canada, together with some smaller countries especially in the Persian Gulf.  They held their foreign-exchange in sterling, protecting that currency from runs, and facilitating trade and investment inside the Commonwealth.  It was a formal relationship with fixed exchange rates, and periodic meetings at Commonwealth summits to coordinate trade policy, and domestic economic policies.  Britain ran a trade surplus, and the other countries were mostly producers of raw materials sold to Britain.  However the commercial rationale was gradually less attractive to the Commonwealth.  Access to the growing London capital market, however, remained an important advantage to the newly independent nations.  As Britain moved increasingly close to Europe, however, the long-term ties began to be in doubt.<ref>Catherine R.

Support for the Commonwealth was twice as high in developing countries as in developed countries; it was lowest in Britain.<ref>[https://thercs.org/assets/Research-/Commonwealth-Conversation-Final-Report.pdf Royal Commonwealth Society, ''An Uncommon Association, a Wealth of Potential:  Final Report of the Commonwealth Conversation'' (London, Royal Commonwealth Society, 2010)]</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/canada-commonwealth-and-the-key-to-relevance/article4279734/ |title=Canada, Commonwealth and the key to relevance |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Renzetti |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/commonwealth-quaint-historical-relic-or-meaningful-bloc/article4279618/ |title=Commonwealth: quaint historical relic or meaningful bloc? |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7931706.stm |title=Queen marks Commonwealth launch |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Commonwealth Anthem===\nAlso to mark the 60th anniversary (Diamond Jubilee) of the Commonwealth in 2009, the Commonwealth Secretariat commissioned Paul Carroll to compose \"The Commonwealth Anthem\".

More broadly, there was the loss of a central role of the British Empire: the defence of the Empire. That role was no longer militarily or financially feasible, as [[Truman Doctrine|Britain's withdrawal from Greece in 1947]] had painfully demonstrated. Britain itself was now just one part of the [[NATO]] military alliance in which the Commonwealth had no role apart from Canada. The ANZUS treaty of 1955 linked Australia, New Zealand, and the [[United States of America|United States]] in a defensive alliance, with Britain and the Commonwealth left out. The second major function of the Empire made London the financial centre of the system. After the Second World War, the British treasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the United States. The loss of defence and financial roles, furthermore, undermined [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph Chamberlain's]] early 20th century vision of a world empire that could combine Imperial preference, mutual defence, and social growth.

This was granted. Now, the majority of the Commonwealth members, including all those from Africa, are republics or have their own native monarch.\n\n[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] withdrew from participation in the Commonwealth in the 1930s, attending its last Commonwealth governmental heads' meeting in 1932.

Its treatment as a member ended on 18 April 1949 when Irish legislation that the Commonwealth chose to regard as having caused Ireland to become a republic became law. It is the only country whose membership terminated without any declaration withdrawing from the organisation. Instead, it was (with its own tacit support) excluded from the organisation.\n\n[[South Africa]] was barred from continuing as a member after it became a republic in 1961, due to hostility from many members, particularly those in Africa and Asia as well as Canada, to its policy of racial [[apartheid]]. The South African government withdrew its application to remain in the organisation as a republic when it became clear at the [[1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] that any such application would be rejected.

Foreign exchange reserves were pooled in London, to be used to fight the war.  In effect Britain procured \u00a32.3&nbsp;billion, of which \u00a31.3&nbsp;billion was from India.  The debt was held in the form of British government securities and became known as \"sterling balances\". By 1950, India, Pakistan and Ceylon had spent much of their sterling, while other countries accumulated more. The sterling area that included all of the Commonwealth except for Canada, together with some smaller countries especially in the Persian Gulf.  They held their foreign-exchange in sterling, protecting that currency from runs, and facilitating trade and investment inside the Commonwealth.  It was a formal relationship with fixed exchange rates, and periodic meetings at Commonwealth summits to coordinate trade policy, and domestic economic policies.  Britain ran a trade surplus, and the other countries were mostly producers of raw materials sold to Britain.  However the commercial rationale was gradually less attractive to the Commonwealth.  Access to the growing London capital market, however, remained an important advantage to the newly independent nations.  As Britain moved increasingly close to Europe, however, the long-term ties began to be in doubt.<ref>Catherine R.

By the 1960s with a sluggish economy Britain tried repeatedly to join the [[European Economic Community]], but this was repeatedly vetoed by [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref>Alan S.

She tried to reassure the other countries that the Commonwealth family was joining forces with the Europeans, and that the new links would not replace the old Commonwealth ties based on historical attachments, which were too sacred to break.  Historian [[Ben Pimlott]] argues that she was mistaken, for joining Europe, \"constituted the most decisive step yet in the progress of severance of familial ties between Britain and its former Empire....It reduced the remaining links to sentimental and cultural ones, and legal niceties.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ben Pimlott|title=The Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkhSn5Fi7c4C|year=1998|page=416|isbn=9780471283300}}</ref>\n\nThe newly independent countries of Africa and Asia concentrated on their own internal political and economic development, and sometimes with their role in the [[Cold War]].  The United States, international agencies, and the Soviet Union became important players, and the British role receded. Indeed, the British considered them burdensome and were themselves alienated from traditional imperialism. Many former colonies saw Britain as a declining loner and would rather have a prosperous Britain linked to a prosperous Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gill Bennett|title=Six Moments of Crisis: Inside British Foreign Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1_EUTmXbDwC&pg=PP87|year=2013|page=87|isbn=9780191641633}}</ref> The dominions saw that their historic ties with Britain were rapidly fraying. The Canadian economy was increasingly integrated with the United States, and had less and less to do with Britain or other Commonwealth nations.
