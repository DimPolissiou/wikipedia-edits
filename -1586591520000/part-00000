{"title_page": "Music Schemata Theory", "text_new": "Music schemata (singular: Music schema) are identifi-able multi-stage musical patterns. Examples of musical patterns are referred to as ''exemplars''. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== David Heinichen ===\n\n=== Joseph Riepel ===\n\n=== The Penn School ===\n\n=== Satzmodelle ===\n\n== Romanesca ==\nThe Romanesca was used primarily as an opening gambit. Its period of great- est currency was the 1720s and 1730s, though it remained an option throughout the cen- tury. As the first schema for an Adagio, the galant Romanesca was so common as to be almost a clich\u00e9 during the first half of the century.\n\n== Prinner ==\n\nThe Prinner was often used as the riposte or answer to an opening gambit. Its period of greatest currency was the 1720s to the 1770s, though it remained an option throughout the century. The presence of a Prinner riposte is one of the best indications of a musical style grounded in the Italian galant.\n\n== Fonte ==\nThe Fonte served to digress from, and then return to, a main key. It was used throughout the eighteenth century, being especially common immediately after the dou- ble bar in minuets or other short movements. In concertos, arias, and other long works, large Fontes often function as digressive episodes.\n\n== Do-Re-Mi == \nThe Do-Re-Mi was one of the most frequent opening gambits in galant music. It was used in every decade and in every genre. It often had its normal bass part in the upper voice and its \u201cmelody\u201d in the bass. The ease with which it could be thus inverted made it a favorite schema for movements in which the bass begins with an imitation of the melody, a procedure especially common early in the eighteenth century.\n\n== Monte ==\nThe Monte was the preferred schema for an ascending sequence. In the earlier eighteenth century, Montes of three or more sections could effect relatively distant modulations. In the later eighteenth century, Montes usually had only two sections that highlighted the subdominant and dominant keys, often in advance of an important cadence.\n\n== Meyer ==\nThe Meyer was often chosen for important themes. Its period of greatest currency was the 1760s through the 1780s. In earlier, shorter examples, the core melodic tones constitute a major fraction of the perceived melody. In later, longer examples, the two paired events constitute brief moments of punctuation amid a profusion of decorative melodic figures.\n\n== Quiescenza ==\nThe Quiescenza marks a short period of quiescence following an important cadence at the end of an important section. As a framing device, it could also appear as an opening gambit (usually not repeated), though this usage was less common. The Quiescenza\u2019s period of greatest currency was the 1760s to the 1790s, and it was especially favored in music written for Vienna or Paris.\n\n== Ponte ==\nThe Ponte was a \u201cbridge\u201d built on the repetition or extension of the domi- nant triad or seventh chord. In minuets, this bridge was placed immediately after the double bar and connected the just-cadenced \u201csecond\u201d key with a return to the original tonic key. More generally, in the latter half of the eighteenth century the Ponte was part of various delaying tactics employed to heighten expectation prior to an important entry or return.\n\n== Fenaroli ==\nThe Fenaroli usually repeated, was most often introduced following a mod- ulation to the dominant key. In the nineteenth-century sense, it was thus one of the earliest types of \u201csecond theme,\u201d though it was too processive to meet the Romantic expectations for a \u201ctrue\u201d theme. A Fenaroli could be initiated on either event one or event two, so a given event could be metrically weak or strong depending on the choice of starting point.\n\n== Sol-Fa-Mi ==\nThe Sol-Fa-Mi was often chosen for important themes. Its period of greatest currency was the 1750s through the 1790s. With its descending melody perceived as per- haps less assertive than, say, a Do-Re-Mi, the Sol-Fa-Mi was most common in movements of slow or moderate tempo, or as a \u201csecond theme\u201d in fast movements. It was a favorite schema for Adagios in the minor mode.\n\n== Indugio ==\nThe Indugio (It., \u201ctarrying\u201d or \u201clingering\u201dA) served as a teasing delay of the approach to a Converging cadence. Uncommon in the first half of the eighteenth century, it quickly became a clich\u00e9 in the second half. For compositions in the major mode, the Indugio allowed, as does the Fonte, the insertion of a brief passage in the minor mode. Often associated with this \u201cdarkening\u201d are \u201cstorm and stress\u201d syncopations.\n\n== Fonte-Romanesca == \nThis schema results from a combination of features belonging to the Romanesca and the Fonte. This schema uses the Long Comma in a descending sequence. (The Long Comma, as named by Robert Gjerdingen, is a cadential gesture in which the bass approaches the tonic from below, tracing scale degrees 6 \u2013 7 \u2013 1, while an upper part descends from 4 to 3.) The Fonte\u2013Romanesca typically presents the Long Comma twice: first in the major mode and then, a third lower, in the minor mode.  Sometimes composers extended the sequence another step, moving a third lower still. {{sfn|Byros|2017|p=77}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|3}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{citation |last=Gjerdingen |title=Music in the Galant Style |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007|isbn=978-0195313710}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Towards an \u201cArchaeology\u201d of Hearing: Schemata and Eighteenth-Century Consciousness |publisher=Korean Institute for Musicology, Musica Humana, Autumn 2009, Vol. 1, No. 2, 235\u2013306 |url= https://www.academia.edu/893638/Towards_an_Archaeology_of_Hearing_Schemata_and_Eighteenth-Century_Consciousness._Musica_Humana_1_2_2009_235_306 |year=2009}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Meyer's Anvil: Revisiting the Schema Concept |publisher=Musical Analysis, 31/iii, Blackwell Publishing Ltd |url= https://www.academia.edu/2477056/Meyers_Anvil_Revisiting_the_Schema_Concept._Music_Analysis_31_3_2012_273_346 |DOI= 10.1111/j.1468-2249.2012.00344.x|year=2012}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Topics and Harmonic Schemata: A Case from Beethoven |publisher=The Oxford Handbook of Topic Theory, pp. 381\u2013414 |url= https://www.academia.edu/9050311/Topics_and_Harmonic_Schemata_A_Case_from_Beethoven._In_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Topic_Theory._Ed._Danuta_Mirka_2014_pp._381_414 |year=2014}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=\"'Hauptruhepuncte des Geistes': Punctuation Schemas and the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata,\" In *What Is a Cadence?: Theoretical and Analytical Perspectives on Cadences in the Classical Repertoire |publisher=Leuven University Press, pp. 215\u2013251 |url= https://www.academia.edu/12618637/_Hauptruhepuncte_des_Geistes_Punctuation_Schemas_and_the_Late-Eighteenth-Century_Sonata_In_What_Is_a_Cadence_Theoretical_and_Analytical_Perspectives_on_Cadences_in_the_Classical_Repertoire._Ed._by_Markus_Neuwirth_and_Pieter_Berg%C3%A9_Leuven_University_Press_2015_215_251 |year=2015}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Mozart's Vintage Corelli: The Microstory of a Fonte-Romanesca |publisher=Int\u00e9gral, 31, 63-89 |url= https://www.academia.edu/36154658/Mozarts_Vintage_Corelli_The_Microstory_of_a_Fonte-Romanesca |year=2017}}\n* {{citation |last=Gjerdingen |title=Child Composers in the Old Conservatories: How Orphans Became Elite Musicians | publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2020|isbn=9780190653590}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://partimenti.org/schemas/index.html Compendia of Schemas] \n* [http://openmusictheory.com/schemataOpensAndCloses Open Music Theory]\n\n[[Category:Classical music]]\n[[Category:Musical analysis]]\n[[Category:Musical improvisation]]\n[[Category:Classical period (music)]]\n[[Category:Baroque music]]\n[[Category:18th century in music]]\n[[Category:17th century in music]]\n[[Category:19th century in music]]\n[[Category:18th-century Italian musicians]]\n[[Category:Accompaniment]]\n[[Category:Neapolitan school composers]]\n[[Category:Music theory]]\n[[Category:Musicology]]\n[[Category:Music history]]\n", "text_old": "Music schemata (singular: Music schema) are identifi-able multi-stage musical patterns.

Sometimes composers extended the sequence another step, moving a third lower still. {{sfn|Byros|2017|p=77}}}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|3}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|3}}\n* {{citation |last=Gjerdingen |title=Music in the Galant Style |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007|isbn=978-0195313710}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Towards an \u201cArchaeology\u201d of Hearing: Schemata and Eighteenth-Century Consciousness |publisher=Korean Institute for Musicology, Musica Humana, Autumn 2009, Vol. 1, No. 2, 235\u2013306 |url= https://www.academia.edu/893638/Towards_an_Archaeology_of_Hearing_Schemata_and_Eighteenth-Century_Consciousness._Musica_Humana_1_2_2009_235_306 |year=2009}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Meyer's Anvil: Revisiting the Schema Concept |publisher=Musical Analysis, 31/iii, Blackwell Publishing Ltd |url= https://www.academia.edu/2477056/Meyers_Anvil_Revisiting_the_Schema_Concept._Music_Analysis_31_3_2012_273_346 |DOI= 10.1111/j.1468-2249.2012.00344.x|year=2012}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Topics and Harmonic Schemata: A Case from Beethoven |publisher=The Oxford Handbook of Topic Theory, pp. 381\u2013414 |url= https://www.academia.edu/9050311/Topics_and_Harmonic_Schemata_A_Case_from_Beethoven._In_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Topic_Theory._Ed._Danuta_Mirka_2014_pp._381_414 |year=2014}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=\"'Hauptruhepuncte des Geistes': Punctuation Schemas and the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata,\" In *What Is a Cadence?: Theoretical and Analytical Perspectives on Cadences in the Classical Repertoire |publisher=Leuven University Press, pp. 215\u2013251 |url= https://www.academia.edu/12618637/_Hauptruhepuncte_des_Geistes_Punctuation_Schemas_and_the_Late-Eighteenth-Century_Sonata_In_What_Is_a_Cadence_Theoretical_and_Analytical_Perspectives_on_Cadences_in_the_Classical_Repertoire._Ed._by_Markus_Neuwirth_and_Pieter_Berg%C3%A9_Leuven_University_Press_2015_215_251 |year=2015}}\n* {{citation |last=Byros |title=Mozart's Vintage Corelli: The Microstory of a Fonte-Romanesca |publisher=Int\u00e9gral, 31, 63-89 |url= https://www.academia.edu/36154658/Mozarts_Vintage_Corelli_The_Microstory_of_a_Fonte-Romanesca |year=2017}}\n* {{citation |last=Gjerdingen |title=Child Composers in the Old Conservatories: How Orphans Became Elite Musicians | publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2020|isbn=9780190653590}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://partimenti.org/schemas/index.html Compendia of Schemas] \n* [http://openmusictheory.com/schemataOpensAndCloses Open Music Theory]\n\n[[Category:Classical music]]\n[[Category:Musical analysis]]\n[[Category:Musical improvisation]]\n[[Category:Classical period (music)]]\n[[Category:Baroque music]]\n[[Category:18th century in music]]\n[[Category:17th century in music]]\n[[Category:19th century in music]]\n[[Category:18th-century Italian musicians]]\n[[Category:Accompaniment]]\n[[Category:Neapolitan school composers]]\n[[Category:Music theory]]\n[[Category:Musicology]]\n[[Category:Music history]]\n", "name_user": "Ronster2019", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Schemata_Theory"}

Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or \"[[qubit]]\", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or they can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with [[quantum logic gate]]s, which are somewhat analogous to [[logic gate|classical logic gates]].\n\n<!--Physical implementations-->\nThere are currently two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer: analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], [[quantum annealing]], and [[adiabatic quantum computation]]. Digital quantum computers use [[quantum logic gate]]s to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or [[qubit]]s.<ref name=2018Report/>{{rp|2\u201313}}\n\n<!-- Computability and complexity -->\nThe study of the [[computational complexity]] of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as [[quantum complexity theory]]. While all [[computational problem]]s solvable by quantum computers are also solvable by classical computers (and conversely all problems solvable by classical computers are also solvable by quantum computers), quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems significantly faster than classical computers. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers when it comes to which problems can, in principle, be solved, they do provide additional power when it comes to the [[time complexity]] of certain problems. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer can solve in ''any feasible amount of time''\u2014a feat known as \"[[quantum supremacy]]\".\n\n== Quantum operations ==\n[[File:Bloch Sphere.svg|thumb|The [[Bloch sphere]] is a representation of a [[qubit]], the fundamental building block of quantum computers.]]\n\nThe prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of [[quantum logic gate]]s.<ref name=\"Nielson-Chuang\">{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last=Nielsen|first=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511976667|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976667|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/465953}}</ref>\n\nA memory consisting of <math display=\"inline\">n</math> bits of information has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a ''[[probability vector]]'' and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state.\n\nIn the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero.  \nIn quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to [[Density matrix|density operators]]. This is the technically rigorous [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates]], but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler. This article focuses on the quantum state vector formalism for simplicity.\n\nWe begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.

Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or \"[[qubit]]\", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or they can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with [[quantum logic gate]]s, which are somewhat analogous to [[logic gate|classical logic gates]].\n\n<!--Physical implementations-->\nThere are currently two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer: analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], [[quantum annealing]], and [[adiabatic quantum computation]]. Digital quantum computers use [[quantum logic gate]]s to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or [[qubit]]s.<ref name=2018Report/>{{rp|2\u201313}}\n\n<!-- Computability and complexity -->\nThe study of the [[computational complexity]] of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as [[quantum complexity theory]]. While all [[computational problem]]s solvable by quantum computers are also solvable by classical computers (and conversely all problems solvable by classical computers are also solvable by quantum computers), quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems significantly faster than classical computers. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers when it comes to which problems can, in principle, be solved, they do provide additional power when it comes to the [[time complexity]] of certain problems. In particular, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer can solve in ''any feasible amount of time''\u2014a feat known as \"[[quantum supremacy]]\".\n\n== Quantum operations ==\n[[File:Bloch Sphere.svg|thumb|The [[Bloch sphere]] is a representation of a [[qubit]], the fundamental building block of quantum computers.]]\n\nThe prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of [[quantum logic gate]]s.<ref name=\"Nielson-Chuang\">{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last=Nielsen|first=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511976667|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976667|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/465953}}</ref>\n\nA memory consisting of <math display=\"inline\">n</math> bits of information has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a ''[[probability vector]]'' and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state.\n\nIn the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero.  \nIn quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to [[Density matrix|density operators]]. This is the technically rigorous [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates]], but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler. This article focuses on the quantum state vector formalism for simplicity.\n\nWe begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.
