Mussoorie-Landour was widely known as the \"Queen of the Hills\". The name Landour is drawn from [[Llanddowror]], a village in [[Carmarthenshire]] in southwest [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Mussoorie blues |work= The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/mussoorie-blues/article3634898.ece |date=July 14, 2012| accessdate = 2017-03-01 |authorlink=Rakhshanda Jalil| first = Rakhshanda | last = Jalil  }}</ref> During the Raj, it was common to give nostalgic English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish names to one's home (or even to British-founded towns), reflecting one's ethnicity. Names drawn from literary works were also common, as from those by [[Robert Burns]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and many others.\n\n== Location and climate ==\n[[File:Landour, Mussoorie, 1869.jpg|thumb|Landour 1869]] [[File:LandourRain.jpg|right|thumb|Landour]]\nLandour is located in the Lower [[Western Himalaya]], in the '''[[Mussoorie]] Range''', the second of the five parallel folds of the [[Himalaya]]. On average, Landour is about 984&nbsp;ft (300 m) above Mussoorie, which itself is mostly at an altitude of 6,800 to 7,798&nbsp;ft (2,250 to 2,377m). The town lies largely on an east-west ridge, with a prominent southerly spur connecting its western end to Mussoorie. The altitude differential, aided by Landour being partly [[Tibet]]-facing, has a marked effect on the temperature, which can be 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b0C lower than in Mussoorie. During the [[monsoon]], Landour receives almost daily rainfall, often heavy. Additionally, pre- and post-monsoon showers mean a rainy season that can run from May to September, though it can be shorter. Before the rains arrive, April\u2013May is the warmest period, with the temperatures rising to over 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. (~85&nbsp;\u00b0F) on hotter days. December to February is downright cold, especially if one does not receive enough direct sunlight, as on the northern slopes. It can snow anywhere between 3 and 15 times in the winter, at times heavily. In a given year Landour receives perhaps twice the snow that Mussoorie does; it also takes longer to melt especially on the north-facing slopes.\n\nIf one travels the {{convert|290|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Landour from [[New Delhi]] by train or bus, a switch at Dehradun is needed. Buses and taxis, and even \"shared taxis\", are easily available. There are also direct buses from New Delhi, and one can easily negotiate with taxis at any of New Delhi's railway stations or at the Delhi airport. One can also fly from Delhi in just 40 min to Jolly Grant Airport east of Dehradun, which saves a lot of time, but it takes another 90 minutes to drive up to Landour from the airport.\n\nEast of Landour lie the small hamlet of [[Dhanaulti]] and the [[Surkhanda Devi]] temple; further east are [[Kanatal]], [[Tehri]] (now submerged by the [[Tehri dam]]) and [[Chamba, Uttarakhand|Chamba]] (not to be confused with the town and district of the same name in Himachal Pradesh). And to the West lie the [[tourist trap]] of [[Kempty Falls]], the military town of [[Chakrata]] and the region of [[Jaunsar]] bordering Himachal Pradesh.\n\n== Early history ==\nLandour is within [[Dehradun District]] of the former [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]]. The United Provinces themselves were carved out of the former Northwest Province of the vast [[Bengal Presidency]], which stretched from Burma to the Khyber Pass; accordingly, early accounts show Landour as part of \"Bengal\", which was technically true though the description was incomplete.\n\nLandour was initially built by and for the [[British Indian Army]]. From 1827 when a [[sanatorium]] was built in Landour,<ref name=ency/> the town was a convalescent station for the military, and hence much of Landour is a [[Cantonment]]. The original sanatorium is now occupied by the Institute of Technology Management (\"ITM\") of the [[DRDO]]; it is at the eastern end of the Landour ridge. In the early 20th century, a full British Military Hospital (BMH) was opened, with a medical staff that specialized in [[tropical diseases]]; the hospital closed soon after 1947. Also within the ITM premises is the former Soldiers' Furlough Home, a holiday home for British and Irish soldiers and JCOs in Indian regiments who lacked the means to return to Europe regularly. Or, the holidaying soldiers were serving in British regiments on rotation in India, their tours of duty lasting anywhere from 6 to 48 months. In terms of area, Landour Cantonment comprises about two-thirds of Landour; the remainder includes Landour Bazaar, which stretches along the spur that connects to Mussoorie.\n\n[[File:Mussoorie and Landour, 1860s.jpg|thumb|[[Mussoorie]] and Landour, 1860s]]\nThe first permanent building in all of Mussoorie-Landour was also built in Landour in 1825. The house was built by [[Frederick Young (East India Company officer)|Captain Frederick Young]], the \"discoverer\" of Mussoorie, who was also the Commandant of the first [[Gurkha]] (or Gorkha) battalion raised by the British after prevailing in the Gurkha War. Young's house, \"[[Mullingar]]\" (hinting at his Irish blood), was the family home during the hot summers in the plains. Young's Dehradun-based battalion, then called the Sirmour (or Sirmoor) Rifles, was initially raised in a Gurkha POW camp in [[Paonta Sahib]] in Sirmour District \u2013 hence the name. The huge L-shaped building, with an outsized courtyard inside the bend of the \"L\", sits prominently atop Mullingar Hill in Landour Cantonment.\n\nAmong distinguished house guests at Mullingar in the early decades were [[Emily Eden]] (see below). Mullingar was expanded, changed hands several times and by the early 20th century had become the Mullingar Estate Hotel. During [[World War II]], Mullingar was leased by the army to house the overflow of convalescing soldiers from the sanatorium, given the huge increase in war-related injuries. The hotel was bursting at the seams, as a number of British civilian evacuees from Burma, the Andamans, Manipur & Nagaland, which were occupied by Japanese forces, were also housed in Mullingar before being shipped out elsewhere. Mullingar finally fell into disuse after 1947 when Britons began to leave India, with the army already having vacated it after the postwar [[demobilization]] of 1945\u201346. The building soon fell into disrepair, occupied largely if not entirely by squatters (see below). A number of the families now living in Mullingar are [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]. Prayer flags flutter in the wind every day, and [[Losar]] celebrations are held in the courtyard every year.\n\nThe legal distinction between Mussoorie and Landour did not arise until the 1860s, when after the historic events of 1857 cantonments were properly surveyed and formalized. In particular, control of the ridge-lines and water sources was crucial, given rising British anxieties over their grip on India. The defensibility of garrisons was critical, especially in hill stations with large European populations. The [[Cantonments Act of 1924]] further clarified the rights of the property owners; new construction of any kind, especially of private homes, was virtually banned. Conservation was also a key goal, given the excesses of the 19th century (see below); the Act clearly states that title to all trees remains with the army, hence there has been no logging in Landour since in over a century, as can be seen. By definition, all non-military and non-governmental buildings built after 1924 are 'illegal'. Therefore, there are few 'modern' homes in Landour, though renovations and reconstruction of pre-existing houses are permitted. Thanks to the 1924 Act, Landour Cantonment is\u2014unlike Landour Bazaar\u2014largely free of the crass commercialization that has scarred much of Mussoorie proper, especially along the 'main drag' of Mall Road where budget tourists throng in the summer. (Proximity to [[Delhi]], [[Chandigarh]] and [[Ambala]] is both a blessing and a curse).\n\nRacially, Landour was distinctly more European than Mussoorie. It was no accident. First, the army presence (albeit non-regimental) offered an excuse to 'keep out' Indians. Second, [[Maharaja]]s were encouraged to build grand summer homes, but were directed towards Mussoorie. Among them were the ruling families of Kapurthala, Nabha, Alwar, Jind, Baroda, Kasmanda, Katesar, Kuchesar and other [[princely states]]. And this despite Maharajas being hand-in-glove with the Raj in terms of ruling the Indian masses; the former, who remained nominally 'autonomous', legitimized the rule of the latter. Tellingly, ''not a single'' princely residence was ''ever'' built in Landour. (The only 'exception' was The Castle, see below, but it was built by the British as a quasi-prison). Even the ruling family of [[Tehri-Garhwal]] (from whom the region was seized by the British) had no residence in Landour, though the family later did acquire some properties from Britons who sold out. These racial barriers, while quite real were more informal than formal; they began to weaken after World War I as the Indian freedom movement gained steam. The author [[Emily Eden]], sister of the [[Governor-General]] [[Lord Auckland]], wrote incisively about the biting racism of Britons towards all Indians (except Maharajas, whose over-the-top hospitality they craved), after spending much time in Landour, Shimla and Ooty in the late 1830s. Many [[Anglo-Indian]] families also put down roots in Landour, and in Barlowganj just below Mussoorie, in the 19th century. They were attracted in part by the schools, and by the sense of 'otherness' versus quotidian India. A handful remain, most having emigrated after 1947, but the few who remain (most are in their golden years) are treasure troves of local lore.\n\nIndeed, the events of 1857 led to a spurt in the European population of Mussoorie-Landour, with many families leaving the 'exposed' towns of the Gangetic Plain. Among the Britons who thus moved to Landour were the parents of [[Jim Corbett]]. Both had lost their spouses, and would meet and remarry in Landour (see below). His mother had moved from Meerut, where her first husband had been killed in action in 1857. Thousands of Europeans, mostly Britons, are buried in the twin towns. The Cantonment has adjacent Protestant and Catholic cemeteries, though due to overcrowding in the former, the latter has of late become non-denominational \u2013 they are managed by the same committee. In 1901, the town had a population of 1720, which climbed up to 3700 in the summers, when the heat of the Indian plains became unbearable.<ref name=ency>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Landour |volume=16 |page=162}}</ref>\n\n== Civic Administration ==\nSince Landour is a cantonment town, it is administered by the [[cantonment board]] which is under the control of the Ministry of Defence. The Station Commander of the Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Board, and an officer an officer of the IDES or Defence Estates Organisation is the Chief Executive Officer who is also the Member-Secretary of the Board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dgde.gov.in/cantonments|title=DGDE|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The President of Landour Cantonment Board is Brig.

The towns have had several schools and \"orphanages\" for both European and mixed-race [[Anglo-Indian]] children since the mid-19th century. (Hint: \"Orphanage\" was often a Raj-era euphemism for a school for illegitimate mixed-race children). Also, there were many missionary-run schools, of which the most well-known was (and remains) [[Woodstock School]], founded in 1854 for the children of American missionaries. Practically all of the other prominent schools including [[Wynberg Allen School]], St. George's School, Mussoorie Public School, Waverley Convent (now CJM) and Vincent Hill (now Guru Nanak 5th Centenary School) are in Mussoorie, not Landour. The [[Indian Army]] also runs a primary school in Landour Cantonment.\n\n[[File:Landour Community Hospital (5290860887).jpg|thumb|right|Landour Community Hospital, originally established 1931]]\nThere are under 100 detached private homes in the Cantonment, and under 200 buildings overall. The non-residential buildings belong to either the military, or to the state-owned broadcasters [[Doordarshan]] and [[All India Radio]], who have repeater stations atop [[Lal Tibba]] hill, at over 7,700&nbsp;ft. the highest point in all of Mussoorie-Landour. The transmitters are mounted on Landour's answer to Paris, an Eiffel-inspired orange-and-white tower that is the most recognizable feature in all of Landour. Lal Tibba was also known as Depot Hill, referring to the convalescent depot. Nearby Sisters Bazaar likewise referred to the nurses' dormitory at the location; nurses are still addressed as 'Sister' in the Subcontinent, from a time in the 19th century when most nurses were Anglican, Methodist or Catholic nuns. The Cantonment is also home to the well-known Landour Community Hospital, founded by American missionaries. At the time of its founding in 1931 it was one of the first good non-military hospitals in the region. It has been run by the Emmanuel Hospital Association, an indigenous Christian health and development agency, since 1981, and continues to provide affordable (or free) medical care to the people of Landour and the surrounding hills.\n[[File:Sisters Bazaar (5275305385).jpg|thumb|left|Sisters Bazaar]]\nAmong natural features in the area, the local peaks are the most prominent. ('Tibba' is a local word for hill/peak). Other than \"Old\" Lal Tibba and Landour hill themselves (which lie within the Cantonment), there is the hunched, heavily forested Pari Tibba (also called Fairy Hill or Witches' Hill), lurking due south of Woodstock School and due east of Wynberg-Allen School. Once a private hunting estate of the ruling family of [[Tehri-Garhwal]], it was not deforested for that very reason. It is also called Burnt Hill, referring to the unusual number of lightning strikes it has taken over the years, which has given rise to local superstitions and also helped keep it free of humans. The hill remains a popular hiking spot for the local boarding schools, but not having motorable roads is blessedly free of \"tourism\". Due north of Landour, {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} away as the crow flies is [[Nag Tibba]] ('Serpent's Peak'), at 3,022 m (9,972&nbsp;ft) the highest peak in the local region. It lends its name to the [[Nag Tibba Range]], itself the next-northerly of the five folds of the Himalaya. To the east of Landour are Tope Tibba and the oddly shaped Pepperpot mountain; both are hiking destinations.\n\nThere are no commercial hotels in Landour Cantonment, and only a handful of rudimentary, quasi-legal \"guest houses\". Landour Bazaar has fewer than 10 equally rudimentary hotels, none of which would merit a single star, with all of them together having perhaps 125 rooms. (Mussoorie proper has over a hundred hotels at various price points, though). There were never any entertainments in Landour \u2013 all the Raj-era theaters, cinemas, dance halls, skating rinks and public gardens were in Mussoorie. Accordingly, the decibel level was \u2013 and is \u2013 markedly lower (thanks to the military's zoning rules) than in Mussoorie, where it is ever-rising thanks to the explosion in middle-class tourism.\n\n== Americana in the Himalaya ==\nAside from the obvious British legacy, Landour has a thick vein of Americana too, with American missionaries having had a strong footing in the town since the 1830s, when the policy changes introduced by the English administrator [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] prompted the rapid growth of American missions across India, particularly those of the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] churches. Generations of American [[missionary]] children (see [[Third Culture Kid]]s) were educated at Woodstock School and/or born in Landour (see [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], below). Of late,{{when|date=May 2019}} their descendants have been deeming a ''dekko'' worthwhile. Nowadays, many young Americans on gap years or on exchange programs spend time learning Hindi at the popular [[Landour Language School]], which was founded in the late 19th century to teach newly arrived missionaries. Another durable reminder of the American connection is the ubiquitous Landour Community Cookbook (1st ''formal'' edition: 1938; informal stencil copies since c. 1900) though the Landour Community Center\u2014once the locus of Anglo-American community life\u2014is itself moribund. A half-dozen bakers in Landour still offer various breads, cookies/biscuits and cakes from 'The Cookbook', though with the rise of packaged foods and the departure of most missionaries, the bakeries are a pale shadow of their former selves. Landour was also one of the first places in India where an American classic such as [[peanut butter]] was made commercially; Plausibly, a number of houses in Landour have American (rather than British) names, among them ''Aloha, Hollywood'' and ''Roanoke''.\n\n== Ecology and environment ==\nLandour is for the most part (unlike largely deforested Mussoorie) carpeted by old-growth forests of [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]] cedar, Himalayan [[oak]], [[chir pine]], [[blue pine]], [[West Himalayan fir]], Himalayan [[maple]], [[rhododendron]], Himalayan manna [[ash tree|ash]] and other tree species. Landour's north-facing slopes have more deodar and fir than other species; the south-facing slopes have more oak than other species. Pines are at lower elevations than deodar and fir, true to form. Among introduced species, the adaptable ''[[Platycladus]]'' (Hindi: ''morpankhi'') does well, and [[Oriental plane]] (Hindi: ''chinar'') too are seen. A logging ban has long been in place in the [[reserved forest]]s around Landour, and the ban is reasonably well enforced.\n\n[[File:Swargarohini and Bandarpunch in the Himalaya, from Landour.jpg|right|thumb|[[Swargarohini]] and [[Bandarpunch]] in the [[Himalaya]], from Landour]]\nLandour offers striking views of the [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] [[Himalaya]], with a wide vista of up to {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} visible on a clear day. The visible massifs and peaks include (West to East) [[Swargarohini]], [[Bandarpunch]], [[Yamnotri]], Jaonli, [[Gangotri]], Srikanta, [[Kedarnath]], Satopanth, Chaukhamba ([[Badrinath]]) and even [[Nanda Devi]]. At its closest point, [[Tibet]] is about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away as the crow flies; it is through Landour that [[Heinrich Harrer]] escaped to Tibet during World War II after breaking out of a British internment camp in [[Dehradun]].\n\nBirdlife is outstanding in its breadth of species; over 350 species may comfortably be seen at various elevations over the course of the year, including both [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species and migratory species from [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Siberia]]. Quite a few endemic species of [[pheasant]]s and [[bird of prey|raptors]] are among the more charismatic species that can be easily seen. As for wild mammals, [[leopard]]s transit the area from time to time; their prey are mainly dogs, including strays from Landour-Mussoorie and the neighboring villages. Also present are some [[jackal]]s, [[barking deer]] (muntjac), [[goral]] (goat-antelope) and the secretive [[sloth bear]]. Among smaller mammals, yellow-throated [[martens]], [[civet]]s, [[jungle cat]]s, and Himalayan [[weasels]] are seen, and the occasional [[flying squirrel]]. Pesky [[rhesus macaques]] and Hanuman [[langur]]s are as present in Landour as anywhere. [[Poaching]] has severely reduced the numbers of the larger wild mammals, though the habitat itself could support larger populations. Of course, most [[charismatic megafauna]] had already been wiped out by the British in the 19th century. Unsurprising, given the British penchant for 'blood sport', especially among the soldiery. After all, Mussoorie was first 'discovered' by Captain Young on a shooting expedition from his garrison in Dehradun. The ecology of the area clearly shows that [[tiger]], [[Himalayan black bear]], [[striped hyena]], [[sambar deer|sambar]], [[serow]], [[Himalayan tahr]], [[gaur]] and other impressive species (all are now locally extinct) were well represented in Mussoorie-Landour before British colonization; 19th-century writings by British hunters boast of the countless trophies they collected in the area.\n\nDeforestation itself dates from British times. There was also an early myth that \"Indian forests are full of germs, which European constitutions cannot take\"; [[clear-felling]] ([[clear-cutting]]) was the answer, as even a casual observer can still see, except in the Cantonment, thanks to the 1924 Act (see above). Many reforestation initiatives began in various hill stations in the late 19th century, thanks to some enlightened Raj administrators, but not in Mussoorie. Of late, the Indian Army has done yeoman service via its 'Eco-Battalions' in terms of re-forestation.\n\nAnother local menace is non-[[biodegradable]] refuse. While there have been some steps by the citizenry (without much help from the authorities) to combat this, it remains a challenge. Much refuse is just dumped down hillsides by many locals\u2014langurs, macaques, civets, stray dogs and other animals forage these open dumps. While the Indian Army has a somewhat better record, Doordarshan and All India Radio (both state-owned, revealingly) are notorious for calmly dumping most of their garbage down the hillsides of the Cantonment. Few in Landour Bazaar seem to take the environment seriously; that is for the \"rich\" of the Cantonment to worry about. Woodstock School, which remains the largest landowner in Landour behind the Indian Army, has sought to be progressive on this score (e.g., by collecting used plastics from across Landour) but its efforts are more effective within and around their own large campus than elsewhere in Landour.\n\n== The citizenry ==\nThe year-round population of the Cantonment is under 1,200, and if you include Landour Bazaar it is under 4,000. The summertime population of Mussoorie triples to perhaps 90,000 with the influx of budget tourists (and hotel staff, shopkeepers, tradesmen etc. to service them), but the population of Landour Bazaar only goes up by perhaps 1,000, given the paucity of hotels. But the summertime population of the Cantonment goes up by only 500, if that; there is no place for outsiders to stay. Indeed, the weekend population of Mussoorie proper too now spurts\u2014year-round\u2014to near-summertime levels, given the improvements in India's highways and the ever-rising numbers of private cars.\n\n[[File:Mussoorie 2002.jpg|right|thumb|The Himalayas from near ''Char Dukan'' in Landour, upper [[Mussoorie]]]]\n\nThe ethnic mix of Landour has changed dramatically since 1947, and since the 1970s\u20131980s due to the departure of most missionaries, and also via the recent Indian economic boom.  Many of the shopkeepers and small-business owners of Landour Bazaar and the Cantonment are descended from ''[[Bania (caste)|bania]]'' merchants who came from far afield in the 19th century\u2014as far away as Gujarat and Bombay\u2014to service the then-growing Anglo-American community.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2001 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Landour had an \"official\" population of roughly 3,500. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Landour has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 70%. In Landour, 8% of the population is under 6 years of age. However, these statistics do not account for the transient population of the Cantonment, which includes military personnel on study tours, or the \"second home\" crowd that owns many of the properties in Landour Cantonment. Nor does it account for the student population at Woodstock or the language school.\n\n== Architecture ==\nArchitecturally speaking, Landour is akin to other Raj-era hill stations of Northern India. Since Mussoorie-Landour never rivalled [[Shimla]] in administrative, political or military terms, there are few 'grand official buildings' to speak of. The private homes are largely the common Raj-era ''[[pastiches]]'', with pitched roofs (often painted a dull red) and large [[verandah]]s, important given the heavy monsoons. Most houses contain architectural echoes both of [[Home Counties]] England and of the resort towns of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Many have well-kept gardens.\n[[File:Char Dhukan (5283961771).jpg|thumb|left|''Char Dukan'' literally Four Shops, Landour]]\n[[File:Landour - Castle Hill.jpg|thumb|right|Castle Hill and The Castle, Landour by [[Samuel Bourne]] (1865)]]\nAbout the only \"architecturally significant\" building was The Castle on the aptly named Castle Hill, now part of [[Survey of India]], where the deposed boy-king [[Duleep Singh]] of Punjab, the son of the iconic [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]], was often \"kept\" for convalescent purposes between 1849 and 1853. (Sadly, The Castle was heavily modified in an ''ad hoc'' manner over the decades, rendering it unrecognizable as compared to early photographs). The [[Amir]] of [[Afghanistan]] too was in the town in quasi-exile at various times in the early 20th century as Raj officials engaged in their customary machinations of map-drawing and re-drawing across the Subcontinent.\n\nA prominent local landmark was the Clock Tower at the start of Landour Bazaar. It was of little architectural merit, but informally marked the boundary between Landour and Mussoorie (others say it is the former Picture Palace movie theater a bit lower down).  Demolished in 2011, the tower is expected to be rebuilt sometime in the future, having been delayed by local political wrangling.\n[[File:Saint Paul Church.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Saint Paul Church, built 1839]]\nLandour has four Raj-era churches, two of them distinctly Indo-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. Of the four, two remain very much in use: Kellogg Church (built 1903, once American [[Presbyterian]], now non-denominational, and also home to the Landour Language School) and the [[St. Paul's Church, Landour|St. Paul's Church]] (built 1840, once [[Anglican]], now non-denominational) in Char Dukan,<ref>[http://www1.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Features/The_Sunday_ET/As_You_Like_It/Landour_Candour/articleshow/2848608.cms Landour Candour] [[The Economic Times]], 9 March 2008.</ref> where [[Jim Corbett]]'s parents, Christopher and Mary Corbett, married on 13 October 1859. A third [[Methodist]] church in Landour Bazaar fell into disuse after the Raj ended and was eventually seized by squatters for commercial purposes by way of '[[kabza]]'. The fourth church is the once-Anglican [[St. Peter's Church, Landour|St. Peter's Church]], latterly [[Catholic]], and now is disuse and occupied by squatters apparently with the 'permission' of the church committee; it is atop Landour hill.\n\n== Residents ==\n[[File:Kellogg Memorial Church, Mussoorie.jpg|right|thumb|Kellogg Memorial Church, Landour, built 1903.]]\nLandour also has an outsized presence on the cultural map of India, its most famous resident being the [[Anglo-Indian]] author [[Ruskin Bond]].<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050423/asp/weekend/story_4623293.asp Haven in the hills] [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]], Calcutta, 23 April 2005.</ref>  Another thespian [[Tom Alter]], himself Landour-raised and a [[Woodstock School]] graduate, was a part-year resident, spending the remainder of his time in [[Bollywood]]. His cousin Stephen Alter, also a [[Woodstock School|Woodstock]] alum and an \"[[Indo-nostalgic]]\" author, is often in town for long stretches . Stephen's father Rev. Bob Alter had been principal of [[Woodstock School|Woodstock]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The media moguls [[Prannoy Roy]] and [[Radhika Roy]], founders of [[NDTV]], also maintain a second home in Landour. The Hindi film director [[Vishal Bhardwaj]] has a house in Landour and is the next door neighbour to Ruskin Bond. Another famous resident of this quaint town is the Indian actor [[Victor Banerjee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Walk the Talk with Vishal Bhardwaj|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnwbrhJBcuU|website=You Tube|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nLandour was home in the 1850s and 1860s to the multi-talented  [[John Lang (writer)|John Lang]], seen as the \"first Australian novelist\". Lang's 1864 grave was rediscovered by Ruskin Bond in Camel's Back Cemetery in Mussoorie and was restored by the Australian High Commission in Delhi (which also has a bolthole nearby).\n\nOther [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] who call Mussoorie (but not Landour) home are the writer  [[William McKay Aitken|Bill Aitken]] and the husband-wife travel-writing team of [[Hugh and Colleen Gantzer]]. And then there is [[Allan Sealy]] of Trotter-Nama fame, down in the valley in Dehradun. And finally, Landour was the unlikely birthplace in 1918 of  [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], in whose name the controversial arch-conservative [[John Birch Society]] would be founded in America, after his murder in China at the hand of [[Communists]]. Landour has, in large part, survived \"untouched\" thanks to the military presence and also due to its small size.\n\n== Sources ==\n* Landour Days: A Writer's Journal by Ruskin Bond.

Mussoorie-Landour was widely known as the \"Queen of the Hills\". The name Landour is drawn from [[Llanddowror]], a village in [[Carmarthenshire]] in southwest [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Mussoorie blues |work= The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/mussoorie-blues/article3634898.ece |date=July 14, 2012| accessdate = 2017-03-01 |authorlink=Rakhshanda Jalil| first = Rakhshanda | last = Jalil  }}</ref> During the Raj, it was common to give nostalgic English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish names to one's home (or even to British-founded towns), reflecting one's ethnicity. Names drawn from literary works were also common, as from those by [[Robert Burns]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and many others.\n\n== Location and climate ==\n[[File:Landour, Mussoorie, 1869.jpg|thumb|Landour 1869]] [[File:LandourRain.jpg|right|thumb|Landour]]\nLandour is located in the Lower [[Western Himalaya]], in the '''[[Mussoorie]] Range''', the second of the five parallel folds of the [[Himalaya]]. On average, Landour is about 984&nbsp;ft (300 m) above Mussoorie, which itself is mostly at an altitude of 6,800 to 7,798&nbsp;ft (2,250 to 2,377m). The town lies largely on an east-west ridge, with a prominent southerly spur connecting its western end to Mussoorie. The altitude differential, aided by Landour being partly [[Tibet]]-facing, has a marked effect on the temperature, which can be 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b0C lower than in Mussoorie. During the [[monsoon]], Landour receives almost daily rainfall, often heavy. Additionally, pre- and post-monsoon showers mean a rainy season that can run from May to September, though it can be shorter. Before the rains arrive, April\u2013May is the warmest period, with the temperatures rising to over 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. (~85&nbsp;\u00b0F) on hotter days. December to February is downright cold, especially if one does not receive enough direct sunlight, as on the northern slopes. It can snow anywhere between 3 and 15 times in the winter, at times heavily. In a given year Landour receives perhaps twice the snow that Mussoorie does; it also takes longer to melt especially on the north-facing slopes.\n\nIf one travels the {{convert|290|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Landour from [[New Delhi]] by train or bus, a switch at Dehradun is needed. Buses and taxis, and even \"shared taxis\", are easily available. There are also direct buses from New Delhi, and one can easily negotiate with taxis at any of New Delhi's railway stations or at the Delhi airport. One can also fly from Delhi in just 40 min to Jolly Grant Airport east of Dehradun, which saves a lot of time, but it takes another 90 minutes to drive up to Landour from the airport.\n\nEast of Landour lie the small hamlet of [[Dhanaulti]] and the [[Surkhanda Devi]] temple; further east are [[Kanatal]], [[Tehri]] (now submerged by the [[Tehri dam]]) and [[Chamba, Uttarakhand|Chamba]] (not to be confused with the town and district of the same name in Himachal Pradesh). And to the West lie the [[tourist trap]] of [[Kempty Falls]], the military town of [[Chakrata]] and the region of [[Jaunsar]] bordering Himachal Pradesh.\n\n== Early history ==\nLandour is within [[Dehradun District]] of the former [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]]. The United Provinces themselves were carved out of the former Northwest Province of the vast [[Bengal Presidency]], which stretched from Burma to the Khyber Pass; accordingly, early accounts show Landour as part of \"Bengal\", which was technically true though the description was incomplete.\n\nLandour was initially built by and for the [[British Indian Army]]. From 1827 when a [[sanatorium]] was built in Landour,<ref name=ency/> the town was a convalescent station for the military, and hence much of Landour is a [[Cantonment]]. The original sanatorium is now occupied by the Institute of Technology Management (\"ITM\") of the [[DRDO]]; it is at the eastern end of the Landour ridge. In the early 20th century, a full British Military Hospital (BMH) was opened, with a medical staff that specialized in [[tropical diseases]]; the hospital closed soon after 1947. Also within the ITM premises is the former Soldiers' Furlough Home, a holiday home for British and Irish soldiers and JCOs in Indian regiments who lacked the means to return to Europe regularly. Or, the holidaying soldiers were serving in British regiments on rotation in India, their tours of duty lasting anywhere from 6 to 48 months. In terms of area, Landour Cantonment comprises about two-thirds of Landour; the remainder includes Landour Bazaar, which stretches along the spur that connects to Mussoorie.\n\n[[File:Mussoorie and Landour, 1860s.jpg|thumb|[[Mussoorie]] and Landour, 1860s]]\nThe first permanent building in all of Mussoorie-Landour was also built in Landour in 1825. The house was built by [[Frederick Young (East India Company officer)|Captain Frederick Young]], the \"discoverer\" of Mussoorie, who was also the Commandant of the first [[Gurkha]] (or Gorkha) battalion raised by the British after prevailing in the Gurkha War. Young's house, \"[[Mullingar]]\" (hinting at his Irish blood), was the family home during the hot summers in the plains. Young's Dehradun-based battalion, then called the Sirmour (or Sirmoor) Rifles, was initially raised in a Gurkha POW camp in [[Paonta Sahib]] in Sirmour District \u2013 hence the name. The huge L-shaped building, with an outsized courtyard inside the bend of the \"L\", sits prominently atop Mullingar Hill in Landour Cantonment.\n\nAmong distinguished house guests at Mullingar in the early decades were [[Emily Eden]] (see below). Mullingar was expanded, changed hands several times and by the early 20th century had become the Mullingar Estate Hotel. During [[World War II]], Mullingar was leased by the army to house the overflow of convalescing soldiers from the sanatorium, given the huge increase in war-related injuries. The hotel was bursting at the seams, as a number of British civilian evacuees from Burma, the Andamans, Manipur & Nagaland, which were occupied by Japanese forces, were also housed in Mullingar before being shipped out elsewhere. Mullingar finally fell into disuse after 1947 when Britons began to leave India, with the army already having vacated it after the postwar [[demobilization]] of 1945\u201346. The building soon fell into disrepair, occupied largely if not entirely by squatters (see below). A number of the families now living in Mullingar are [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]. Prayer flags flutter in the wind every day, and [[Losar]] celebrations are held in the courtyard every year.\n\nThe legal distinction between Mussoorie and Landour did not arise until the 1860s, when after the historic events of 1857 cantonments were properly surveyed and formalized. In particular, control of the ridge-lines and water sources was crucial, given rising British anxieties over their grip on India. The defensibility of garrisons was critical, especially in hill stations with large European populations. The [[Cantonments Act of 1924]] further clarified the rights of the property owners; new construction of any kind, especially of private homes, was virtually banned. Conservation was also a key goal, given the excesses of the 19th century (see below); the Act clearly states that title to all trees remains with the army, hence there has been no logging in Landour since in over a century, as can be seen. By definition, all non-military and non-governmental buildings built after 1924 are 'illegal'. Therefore, there are few 'modern' homes in Landour, though renovations and reconstruction of pre-existing houses are permitted. Thanks to the 1924 Act, Landour Cantonment is\u2014unlike Landour Bazaar\u2014largely free of the crass commercialization that has scarred much of Mussoorie proper, especially along the 'main drag' of Mall Road where budget tourists throng in the summer. (Proximity to [[Delhi]], [[Chandigarh]] and [[Ambala]] is both a blessing and a curse).\n\nRacially, Landour was distinctly more European than Mussoorie. It was no accident. First, the army presence (albeit non-regimental) offered an excuse to 'keep out' Indians. Second, [[Maharaja]]s were encouraged to build grand summer homes, but were directed towards Mussoorie. Among them were the ruling families of Kapurthala, Nabha, Alwar, Jind, Baroda, Kasmanda, Katesar, Kuchesar and other [[princely states]]. And this despite Maharajas being hand-in-glove with the Raj in terms of ruling the Indian masses; the former, who remained nominally 'autonomous', legitimized the rule of the latter. Tellingly, ''not a single'' princely residence was ''ever'' built in Landour. (The only 'exception' was The Castle, see below, but it was built by the British as a quasi-prison). Even the ruling family of [[Tehri-Garhwal]] (from whom the region was seized by the British) had no residence in Landour, though the family later did acquire some properties from Britons who sold out. These racial barriers, while quite real were more informal than formal; they began to weaken after World War I as the Indian freedom movement gained steam. The author [[Emily Eden]], sister of the [[Governor-General]] [[Lord Auckland]], wrote incisively about the biting racism of Britons towards all Indians (except Maharajas, whose over-the-top hospitality they craved), after spending much time in Landour, Shimla and Ooty in the late 1830s. Many [[Anglo-Indian]] families also put down roots in Landour, and in Barlowganj just below Mussoorie, in the 19th century. They were attracted in part by the schools, and by the sense of 'otherness' versus quotidian India. A handful remain, most having emigrated after 1947, but the few who remain (most are in their golden years) are treasure troves of local lore.\n\nIndeed, the events of 1857 led to a spurt in the European population of Mussoorie-Landour, with many families leaving the 'exposed' towns of the Gangetic Plain. Among the Britons who thus moved to Landour were the parents of [[Jim Corbett]]. Both had lost their spouses, and would meet and remarry in Landour (see below). His mother had moved from Meerut, where her first husband had been killed in action in 1857. Thousands of Europeans, mostly Britons, are buried in the twin towns. The Cantonment has adjacent Protestant and Catholic cemeteries, though due to overcrowding in the former, the latter has of late become non-denominational \u2013 they are managed by the same committee. In 1901, the town had a population of 1720, which climbed up to 3700 in the summers, when the heat of the Indian plains became unbearable.<ref name=ency>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Landour |volume=16 |page=162}}</ref>\n\n== Civic Administration ==\nSince Landour is a cantonment town, it is administered by the [[cantonment board]] which is under the control of the Ministry of Defence. The Station Commander of the Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Board, and an officer an officer of the IDES or Defence Estates Organisation is the Chief Executive Officer who is also the Member-Secretary of the Board<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dgde.gov.in/cantonments|title=DGDE|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

Neeraj Gosain while the CEO is Shri Abhishek Rathour, IDES.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cblandour.org.in/administration/|title=CBLandour|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Councillors, or representatives of citizens, are elected from 6 wards in Landour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/DoGLuiAOItRGcQysRAf47I/Landour-Uttarakhand--Writer-on-the-hill.html|title=Landour, Uttarakhand {{!}} Writer on the hill|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== A few local facts ==\n[[File:Dehradun Valley from Landour, Uttarakhand India November 2010.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the valley from Landour, Uttarakhand]]\nLike Mussoorie and Dehradun, Landour has long been a center of secondary education. The towns have had several schools and \"orphanages\" for both European and mixed-race [[Anglo-Indian]] children since the mid-19th century. (Hint: \"Orphanage\" was often a Raj-era euphemism for a school for illegitimate mixed-race children). Also, there were many missionary-run schools, of which the most well-known was (and remains) [[Woodstock School]], founded in 1854 for the children of American missionaries. Practically all of the other prominent schools including [[Wynberg Allen School]], St. George's School, Mussoorie Public School, Waverley Convent (now CJM) and Vincent Hill (now Guru Nanak 5th Centenary School) are in Mussoorie, not Landour. The [[Indian Army]] also runs a primary school in Landour Cantonment.\n\n[[File:Landour Community Hospital (5290860887).jpg|thumb|right|Landour Community Hospital, originally established 1931]]\nThere are under 100 detached private homes in the Cantonment, and under 200 buildings overall. The non-residential buildings belong to either the military, or to the state-owned broadcasters [[Doordarshan]] and [[All India Radio]], who have repeater stations atop [[Lal Tibba]] hill, at over 7,700&nbsp;ft. the highest point in all of Mussoorie-Landour. The transmitters are mounted on Landour's answer to Paris, an Eiffel-inspired orange-and-white tower that is the most recognizable feature in all of Landour. Lal Tibba was also known as Depot Hill, referring to the convalescent depot. Nearby Sisters Bazaar likewise referred to the nurses' dormitory at the location; nurses are still addressed as 'Sister' in the Subcontinent, from a time in the 19th century when most nurses were Anglican, Methodist or Catholic nuns. The Cantonment is also home to the well-known Landour Community Hospital, founded by American missionaries. At the time of its founding in 1931 it was one of the first good non-military hospitals in the region. It has been run by the Emmanuel Hospital Association, an indigenous Christian health and development agency, since 1981, and continues to provide affordable (or free) medical care to the people of Landour and the surrounding hills.\n[[File:Sisters Bazaar (5275305385).jpg|thumb|left|Sisters Bazaar]]\nAmong natural features in the area, the local peaks are the most prominent. ('Tibba' is a local word for hill/peak). Other than \"Old\" Lal Tibba and Landour hill themselves (which lie within the Cantonment), there is the hunched, heavily forested Pari Tibba (also called Fairy Hill or Witches' Hill), lurking due south of Woodstock School and due east of Wynberg-Allen School. Once a private hunting estate of the ruling family of [[Tehri-Garhwal]], it was not deforested for that very reason. It is also called Burnt Hill, referring to the unusual number of lightning strikes it has taken over the years, which has given rise to local superstitions and also helped keep it free of humans. The hill remains a popular hiking spot for the local boarding schools, but not having motorable roads is blessedly free of \"tourism\". Due north of Landour, {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} away as the crow flies is [[Nag Tibba]] ('Serpent's Peak'), at 3,022 m (9,972&nbsp;ft) the highest peak in the local region. It lends its name to the [[Nag Tibba Range]], itself the next-northerly of the five folds of the Himalaya. To the east of Landour are Tope Tibba and the oddly shaped Pepperpot mountain; both are hiking destinations.\n\nThere are no commercial hotels in Landour Cantonment, and only a handful of rudimentary, quasi-legal \"guest houses\". Landour Bazaar has fewer than 10 equally rudimentary hotels, none of which would merit a single star, with all of them together having perhaps 125 rooms. (Mussoorie proper has over a hundred hotels at various price points, though). There were never any entertainments in Landour \u2013 all the Raj-era theaters, cinemas, dance halls, skating rinks and public gardens were in Mussoorie. Accordingly, the decibel level was \u2013 and is \u2013 markedly lower (thanks to the military's zoning rules) than in Mussoorie, where it is ever-rising thanks to the explosion in middle-class tourism.\n\n== Americana in the Himalaya ==\nAside from the obvious British legacy, Landour has a thick vein of Americana too, with American missionaries having had a strong footing in the town since the 1830s, when the policy changes introduced by the English administrator [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] prompted the rapid growth of American missions across India, particularly those of the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] churches. Generations of American [[missionary]] children (see [[Third Culture Kid]]s) were educated at Woodstock School and/or born in Landour (see [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], below). Of late,{{when|date=May 2019}} their descendants have been deeming a ''dekko'' worthwhile. Nowadays, many young Americans on gap years or on exchange programs spend time learning Hindi at the popular [[Landour Language School]], which was founded in the late 19th century to teach newly arrived missionaries. Another durable reminder of the American connection is the ubiquitous Landour Community Cookbook (1st ''formal'' edition: 1938; informal stencil copies since c. 1900) though the Landour Community Center\u2014once the locus of Anglo-American community life\u2014is itself moribund. A half-dozen bakers in Landour still offer various breads, cookies/biscuits and cakes from 'The Cookbook', though with the rise of packaged foods and the departure of most missionaries, the bakeries are a pale shadow of their former selves. Landour was also one of the first places in India where an American classic such as [[peanut butter]] was made commercially; Plausibly, a number of houses in Landour have American (rather than British) names, among them ''Aloha, Hollywood'' and ''Roanoke''.\n\n== Ecology and environment ==\nLandour is for the most part (unlike largely deforested Mussoorie) carpeted by old-growth forests of [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]] cedar, Himalayan [[oak]], [[chir pine]], [[blue pine]], [[West Himalayan fir]], Himalayan [[maple]], [[rhododendron]], Himalayan manna [[ash tree|ash]] and other tree species. Landour's north-facing slopes have more deodar and fir than other species; the south-facing slopes have more oak than other species. Pines are at lower elevations than deodar and fir, true to form. Among introduced species, the adaptable ''[[Platycladus]]'' (Hindi: ''morpankhi'') does well, and [[Oriental plane]] (Hindi: ''chinar'') too are seen. A logging ban has long been in place in the [[reserved forest]]s around Landour, and the ban is reasonably well enforced.\n\n[[File:Swargarohini and Bandarpunch in the Himalaya, from Landour.jpg|right|thumb|[[Swargarohini]] and [[Bandarpunch]] in the [[Himalaya]], from Landour]]\nLandour offers striking views of the [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] [[Himalaya]], with a wide vista of up to {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} visible on a clear day. The visible massifs and peaks include (West to East) [[Swargarohini]], [[Bandarpunch]], [[Yamnotri]], Jaonli, [[Gangotri]], Srikanta, [[Kedarnath]], Satopanth, Chaukhamba ([[Badrinath]]) and even [[Nanda Devi]]. At its closest point, [[Tibet]] is about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away as the crow flies; it is through Landour that [[Heinrich Harrer]] escaped to Tibet during World War II after breaking out of a British internment camp in [[Dehradun]].\n\nBirdlife is outstanding in its breadth of species; over 350 species may comfortably be seen at various elevations over the course of the year, including both [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species and migratory species from [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Siberia]]. Quite a few endemic species of [[pheasant]]s and [[bird of prey|raptors]] are among the more charismatic species that can be easily seen. As for wild mammals, [[leopard]]s transit the area from time to time; their prey are mainly dogs, including strays from Landour-Mussoorie and the neighboring villages. Also present are some [[jackal]]s, [[barking deer]] (muntjac), [[goral]] (goat-antelope) and the secretive [[sloth bear]]. Among smaller mammals, yellow-throated [[martens]], [[civet]]s, [[jungle cat]]s, and Himalayan [[weasels]] are seen, and the occasional [[flying squirrel]]. Pesky [[rhesus macaques]] and Hanuman [[langur]]s are as present in Landour as anywhere. [[Poaching]] has severely reduced the numbers of the larger wild mammals, though the habitat itself could support larger populations. Of course, most [[charismatic megafauna]] had already been wiped out by the British in the 19th century. Unsurprising, given the British penchant for 'blood sport', especially among the soldiery. After all, Mussoorie was first 'discovered' by Captain Young on a shooting expedition from his garrison in Dehradun. The ecology of the area clearly shows that [[tiger]], [[Himalayan black bear]], [[striped hyena]], [[sambar deer|sambar]], [[serow]], [[Himalayan tahr]], [[gaur]] and other impressive species (all are now locally extinct) were well represented in Mussoorie-Landour before British colonization; 19th-century writings by British hunters boast of the countless trophies they collected in the area.\n\nDeforestation itself dates from British times. There was also an early myth that \"Indian forests are full of germs, which European constitutions cannot take\"; [[clear-felling]] ([[clear-cutting]]) was the answer, as even a casual observer can still see, except in the Cantonment, thanks to the 1924 Act (see above). Many reforestation initiatives began in various hill stations in the late 19th century, thanks to some enlightened Raj administrators, but not in Mussoorie. Of late, the Indian Army has done yeoman service via its 'Eco-Battalions' in terms of re-forestation.\n\nAnother local menace is non-[[biodegradable]] refuse. While there have been some steps by the citizenry (without much help from the authorities) to combat this, it remains a challenge. Much refuse is just dumped down hillsides by many locals\u2014langurs, macaques, civets, stray dogs and other animals forage these open dumps. While the Indian Army has a somewhat better record, Doordarshan and All India Radio (both state-owned, revealingly) are notorious for calmly dumping most of their garbage down the hillsides of the Cantonment. Few in Landour Bazaar seem to take the environment seriously; that is for the \"rich\" of the Cantonment to worry about. Woodstock School, which remains the largest landowner in Landour behind the Indian Army, has sought to be progressive on this score (e.g., by collecting used plastics from across Landour) but its efforts are more effective within and around their own large campus than elsewhere in Landour.\n\n== The citizenry ==\nThe year-round population of the Cantonment is under 1,200, and if you include Landour Bazaar it is under 4,000. The summertime population of Mussoorie triples to perhaps 90,000 with the influx of budget tourists (and hotel staff, shopkeepers, tradesmen etc. to service them), but the population of Landour Bazaar only goes up by perhaps 1,000, given the paucity of hotels. But the summertime population of the Cantonment goes up by only 500, if that; there is no place for outsiders to stay. Indeed, the weekend population of Mussoorie proper too now spurts\u2014year-round\u2014to near-summertime levels, given the improvements in India's highways and the ever-rising numbers of private cars.\n\n[[File:Mussoorie 2002.jpg|right|thumb|The Himalayas from near ''Char Dukan'' in Landour, upper [[Mussoorie]]]]\n\nThe ethnic mix of Landour has changed dramatically since 1947, and since the 1970s\u20131980s due to the departure of most missionaries, and also via the recent Indian economic boom.  Many of the shopkeepers and small-business owners of Landour Bazaar and the Cantonment are descended from ''[[Bania (caste)|bania]]'' merchants who came from far afield in the 19th century\u2014as far away as Gujarat and Bombay\u2014to service the then-growing Anglo-American community.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2001 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Landour had an \"official\" population of roughly 3,500. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Landour has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 85%, and female literacy is 70%. In Landour, 8% of the population is under 6 years of age. However, these statistics do not account for the transient population of the Cantonment, which includes military personnel on study tours, or the \"second home\" crowd that owns many of the properties in Landour Cantonment. Nor does it account for the student population at Woodstock or the language school.\n\n== Architecture ==\nArchitecturally speaking, Landour is akin to other Raj-era hill stations of Northern India. Since Mussoorie-Landour never rivalled [[Shimla]] in administrative, political or military terms, there are few 'grand official buildings' to speak of. The private homes are largely the common Raj-era ''[[pastiches]]'', with pitched roofs (often painted a dull red) and large [[verandah]]s, important given the heavy monsoons. Most houses contain architectural echoes both of [[Home Counties]] England and of the resort towns of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Many have well-kept gardens.\n[[File:Char Dhukan (5283961771).jpg|thumb|left|''Char Dukan'' literally Four Shops, Landour]]\n[[File:Landour - Castle Hill.jpg|thumb|right|Castle Hill and The Castle, Landour by [[Samuel Bourne]] (1865)]]\nAbout the only \"architecturally significant\" building was The Castle on the aptly named Castle Hill, now part of [[Survey of India]], where the deposed boy-king [[Duleep Singh]] of Punjab, the son of the iconic [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]], was often \"kept\" for convalescent purposes between 1849 and 1853. (Sadly, The Castle was heavily modified in an ''ad hoc'' manner over the decades, rendering it unrecognizable as compared to early photographs). The [[Amir]] of [[Afghanistan]] too was in the town in quasi-exile at various times in the early 20th century as Raj officials engaged in their customary machinations of map-drawing and re-drawing across the Subcontinent.\n\nA prominent local landmark was the Clock Tower at the start of Landour Bazaar. It was of little architectural merit, but informally marked the boundary between Landour and Mussoorie (others say it is the former Picture Palace movie theater a bit lower down).  Demolished in 2011, the tower is expected to be rebuilt sometime in the future, having been delayed by local political wrangling.\n[[File:Saint Paul Church.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Saint Paul Church, built 1839]]\nLandour has four Raj-era churches, two of them distinctly Indo-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. Of the four, two remain very much in use: Kellogg Church (built 1903, once American [[Presbyterian]], now non-denominational, and also home to the Landour Language School) and the [[St. Paul's Church, Landour|St. Paul's Church]] (built 1840, once [[Anglican]], now non-denominational) in Char Dukan,<ref>[http://www1.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Features/The_Sunday_ET/As_You_Like_It/Landour_Candour/articleshow/2848608.cms Landour Candour] [[The Economic Times]], 9 March 2008.</ref> where [[Jim Corbett]]'s parents, Christopher and Mary Corbett, married on 13 October 1859. A third [[Methodist]] church in Landour Bazaar fell into disuse after the Raj ended and was eventually seized by squatters for commercial purposes by way of '[[kabza]]'. The fourth church is the once-Anglican [[St. Peter's Church, Landour|St. Peter's Church]], latterly [[Catholic]], and now is disuse and occupied by squatters apparently with the 'permission' of the church committee; it is atop Landour hill.\n\n== Residents ==\n[[File:Kellogg Memorial Church, Mussoorie.jpg|right|thumb|Kellogg Memorial Church, Landour, built 1903.]]\nLandour also has an outsized presence on the cultural map of India, its most famous resident being the [[Anglo-Indian]] author [[Ruskin Bond]].<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050423/asp/weekend/story_4623293.asp Haven in the hills] [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]], Calcutta, 23 April 2005.</ref>  Another thespian [[Tom Alter]], himself Landour-raised and a [[Woodstock School]] graduate, was a part-year resident, spending the remainder of his time in [[Bollywood]]. His cousin Stephen Alter, also a [[Woodstock School|Woodstock]] alum and an \"[[Indo-nostalgic]]\" author, is often in town for long stretches . Stephen's father Rev. Bob Alter had been principal of [[Woodstock School|Woodstock]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The media moguls [[Prannoy Roy]] and [[Radhika Roy]], founders of [[NDTV]], also maintain a second home in Landour. The Hindi film director [[Vishal Bhardwaj]] has a house in Landour and is the next door neighbour to Ruskin Bond. Another famous resident of this quaint town is the Indian actor [[Victor Banerjee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Walk the Talk with Vishal Bhardwaj|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnwbrhJBcuU|website=You Tube|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nLandour was home in the 1850s and 1860s to the multi-talented  [[John Lang (writer)|John Lang]], seen as the \"first Australian novelist\". Lang's 1864 grave was rediscovered by Ruskin Bond in Camel's Back Cemetery in Mussoorie and was restored by the Australian High Commission in Delhi (which also has a bolthole nearby).\n\nOther [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] who call Mussoorie (but not Landour) home are the writer  [[William McKay Aitken|Bill Aitken]] and the husband-wife travel-writing team of [[Hugh and Colleen Gantzer]]. And then there is [[Allan Sealy]] of Trotter-Nama fame, down in the valley in Dehradun. And finally, Landour was the unlikely birthplace in 1918 of  [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], in whose name the controversial arch-conservative [[John Birch Society]] would be founded in America, after his murder in China at the hand of [[Communists]]. Landour has, in large part, survived \"untouched\" thanks to the military presence and also due to its small size.\n\n== Sources ==\n* Landour Days: A Writer's Journal by Ruskin Bond.

Under [[Akbar]], he was placed in charge of [[Agra]]. Later, he was made governor of [[Gujarat]]. At various times, he also managed Akbar's Mint at [[Bengal]] and served in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Todar Mal's most significant contribution, which is appreciated even today, is that he overhauled the revenue system of Akbar's Mughal empire. Raja Todarmal built a fortress-palace at [[Laharpur]] in the [[Sitapur]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]].\n\nBeveridge records that Raja Todar Mal had got leave from Akbar and was on his way to [[Haridwar]], but he received a letter from Akbar in which the latter is said to have written that \"it was better to go on working and doing good to the world than to go on a pilgrimage.\" Todar Mal also translated [[Bhagavata Purana]] into [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nFollowing Todar Mal's death on 8 November 1589 in [[Lahore]], his body was cremated according to the Hindu traditions. Raja Bhagwan Das, his colleague in the charge of Lahore, was present at the ceremony. Of his two sons, Dhari was killed in a battle in [[Sindh]]. Another son, Kalyan Das, was sent by Todar Mal to subdue the Raja of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] in the [[Himalayas]].

On this basis, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with their own rates of revenue and a schedule of individual crops. This system was prevalent where the Mughal administration could survey the land and keep careful accounts. For the revenue system, Akbar's territory was divided into 15 Subahs, which were further subdivided into a total of 187 Sarkars across 15 subahs, and those 197 sarkars (sirkar) were further subdivided into a total of 3367 Mahals or [[Pargana]]. Several Mahals were grouped into Dasturs, a unit between Mahal and Sirkar. Portion of larger Mahal or Pargana was called ''taraf''. Mahals was subdivided into standardised Bighas. A Bigha was made of 3600 Ilahi Gaj, which is roughly half of modern acre. Unit of measurement was standardised to ''Ilahi Gaj'', which was equivalent to 41 fingers (29-32 inches). Lead measuring rope, called Tenab, was also standardised by joining pieces of Bamboo with iron rings so that the length of Tenab did not vary with seasonal changes.<ref name=tod1>[Indian History, VK Agnihotri, pp.B249 ]</ref><ref name=tod2>[The Challenges of Indian Management, B R Virmani pp.57]</ref>\n\nThis system was not applicable in the provinces like Gujarat and Bengal.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Death==\nTodar Mal died in [[Lahore]] on 8 November 1589.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=00701023&ct=206&rqs=94&rqs=95&rqs=282&rqs=283&rqs=344&rqs=345&rqs=769&rqs=770\n|title = The Akbarnama of Abu Fazl, Volume 3, chpt. 207}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] was rebuilt in 1585 by Todar Mal.<ref>http://www.bhu.ac.in/Centre/temples.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tirupati temple - Medieval history|url=http://www.aptourism.in/index.php/k2-separator/k2/item/37-tirupatitemple#.UqpsBif_lic|publisher=A.P Tourism|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nTodar Mal is featured in the video games ''[[Civilization IV|Sid Meier's Civilization IV]]: Beyond the Sword'', ''[[Civilization V|Sid Meier's Civilization V]]: Gods and Kings'', and most recently in [[Civilization VI|Sid Meier's Civilization VI]] as a \"great merchant\".\nHe has also\n\nIn the Indian historical fiction television series [[Jodha Akbar]], Todar Mal is portrayed by [[Shaurya Singh]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bengali calendar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Resources==\n* [http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main \"Ab\u016b al-Fa\u017cl \u201c\u02bfAll\u0101m\u012b\u201d ibn Mub\u0101rak, \u0160ay\u1e2b\" and \"The Ain i Akbari\", vol. 1.]  Persian Texts in Translation, The Packard Humanities Institute.\n* The Akbarnama also is available online at: http://persian.packhum.org/persian/\n\n==External links==\n* http://sitapur.nic.in/\n* http://sitapur.nic.in/newpage6.htm{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}\n* http://www.kayastha.org/kayastha_chitragupta.html\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095001/http://www.acesun.com/rishisriv/kayasthacanada/Article3.htm\n* http://www.engr.mun.ca/~asharan/TODARMAL/TODARMALV6.pdf\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Todar Mal, Raja}}\n[[Category:Mughal nobility]]\n[[Category:Medieval India]]\n[[Category:16th-century Indian monarchs]]\n[[Category:1589 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindus]]\n[[Category:Akbar]]\n[[Category:1500 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|finance minister of Akbar|the Jain scholar|Pandit Todarmal}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=February 2016}}\n{{Infobox royalty\n| image        = Raja Todar Mall, Finance Minister of Akbar.jpg\n| birth_date   = 1 January 1500\n| caption      =\n| birth_place  = [[Udaipurwati]], [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]\n| death_date   = {{death date|1589|11|08|df=y}}\n| death_place  = Present-day [[Lahore]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]]\n| religion     = [[Hinduism]]\n| occupation   = Finance minister of the [[Mughal Empire]] during the reign of [[Akbar]]\n| spouse       =\n| parents      =\n| children     =\n}}\n[[Raja]] '''Todar Mal''' was the [[Finance Minister]] of the [[Mughal empire]] during [[Akbar]]'s reign.

Raja Bhagwan Das, his colleague in the charge of Lahore, was present at the ceremony. Of his two sons, Dhari was killed in a battle in [[Sindh]]. Another son, Kalyan Das, was sent by Todar Mal to subdue the Raja of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] in the [[Himalayas]]. He rose to become the Finance Minister in Akbar's Darbar.\n\n==As a soldier==\nTodar Mal is recognized as an able warrior, who led in various battles.\n{{quote|text=In 971, he was employed under Muzaffar and in 972, he served under Akbar against Khan Zaman (vide no 61).<ref name=\"Ain\">The Ain i Akbari by Abul Fazlallami, translated from the original Persian, by [[Heinrich Blochmann]] and Colonel Henry Sullivan Jarret, Volume 1, Page 376, Low Price Publications India</ref>}}\n \n{{quote|text=In the 19th year, after the conquest of Patna, he got an Salam and naqqara (A'in 19) and was ordered to accompany MunSim Khan to Bengal. He was the soul of the expedition. In the battle with Da'ud Khan-i-Kharani, when Khan Alam had been killed, and Munsim Khan's horse had run away, the Raja held his ground bravely, and not only was there no defeat but an actual victory. \"What harm\" said Todar Mal, \"if Khan Alam is dead; what fear if the Khan Khanan's horse has run away, the empire is ours!\"<ref name=\"Ain\" />}}\n\n==As a Finance minister of Akbar==\nTodar Mal succeeded Khwaja Malik I'timad Khan in 1560. Raja Todar Mal introduced standard weights and measures, a land survey and settlement system, revenue districts and officers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This system of maintenance by Patwari is still used in Indian Subcontinent which was improved by British Raj and Government of India.\n\nRaja Todar Mal, as finance minister of Akbar, introduced a new system of revenue known as ''zabt'' and a system of taxation called ''dahshala''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Todar Mal|url=http://reflectiveindian.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/raja-todar-mal/|work=The Reflective Indian|publisher=wordpress.com|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe took a careful survey of crop yields and prices cultivated for a 10-year period 1570\u20131580. On this basis, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with their own rates of revenue and a schedule of individual crops. This system was prevalent where the Mughal administration could survey the land and keep careful accounts. For the revenue system, Akbar's territory was divided into 15 Subahs, which were further subdivided into a total of 187 Sarkars across 15 subahs, and those 197 sarkars (sirkar) were further subdivided into a total of 3367 Mahals or [[Pargana]]. Several Mahals were grouped into Dasturs, a unit between Mahal and Sirkar. Portion of larger Mahal or Pargana was called ''taraf''. Mahals was subdivided into standardised Bighas. A Bigha was made of 3600 Ilahi Gaj, which is roughly half of modern acre. Unit of measurement was standardised to ''Ilahi Gaj'', which was equivalent to 41 fingers (29-32 inches). Lead measuring rope, called Tenab, was also standardised by joining pieces of Bamboo with iron rings so that the length of Tenab did not vary with seasonal changes.<ref name=tod1>[Indian History, VK Agnihotri, pp.B249 ]</ref><ref name=tod2>[The Challenges of Indian Management, B R Virmani pp.57]</ref>\n\nThis system was not applicable in the provinces like Gujarat and Bengal.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Death==\nTodar Mal died in [[Lahore]] on 8 November 1589.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=00701023&ct=206&rqs=94&rqs=95&rqs=282&rqs=283&rqs=344&rqs=345&rqs=769&rqs=770\n|title = The Akbarnama of Abu Fazl, Volume 3, chpt. 207}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] was rebuilt in 1585 by Todar Mal.<ref>http://www.bhu.ac.in/Centre/temples.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tirupati temple - Medieval history|url=http://www.aptourism.in/index.php/k2-separator/k2/item/37-tirupatitemple#.UqpsBif_lic|publisher=A.P Tourism|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nTodar Mal is featured in the video games ''[[Civilization IV|Sid Meier's Civilization IV]]: Beyond the Sword'', ''[[Civilization V|Sid Meier's Civilization V]]: Gods and Kings'', and most recently in [[Civilization VI|Sid Meier's Civilization VI]] as a \"great merchant\".\nHe has also\n\nIn the Indian historical fiction television series [[Jodha Akbar]], Todar Mal is portrayed by [[Shaurya Singh]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bengali calendar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Resources==\n* [http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main \"Ab\u016b al-Fa\u017cl \u201c\u02bfAll\u0101m\u012b\u201d ibn Mub\u0101rak, \u0160ay\u1e2b\" and \"The Ain i Akbari\", vol. 1.]  Persian Texts in Translation, The Packard Humanities Institute.\n* The Akbarnama also is available online at: http://persian.packhum.org/persian/\n\n==External links==\n* http://sitapur.nic.in/\n* http://sitapur.nic.in/newpage6.htm{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}\n* http://www.kayastha.org/kayastha_chitragupta.html\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095001/http://www.acesun.com/rishisriv/kayasthacanada/Article3.htm\n* http://www.engr.mun.ca/~asharan/TODARMAL/TODARMALV6.pdf\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Todar Mal, Raja}}\n[[Category:Mughal nobility]]\n[[Category:Medieval India]]\n[[Category:16th-century Indian monarchs]]\n[[Category:1589 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindus]]\n[[Category:Akbar]]\n[[Category:1500 births]]\n", "name_user": "122.166.135.43", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLife)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todar_Mal"}

In the Trust's early years, prior to the incorporation of the charity, properties were often bought with the support of the Manifold Trust.  The Trust's current portfolio also includes properties bequeathed to the Trust, leased, or operated through a management agreement on behalf of other owners.  Dates of acquisition and first lettings are shown where available from Landmark Trust or other published sources; time differences between dates often reflect previous/current ownership and the extent of restoration required.\n\nDetailed histories of each building are prepared by the Trust's Historian during its renovation.

Off-road walkers typically walk about {{convert|1200|mi|km}} and take two or three months for the expedition.  Two much-photographed signposts indicate the traditional distance at each end.\n\n* [[Land's End]] is the traditionally acknowledged extreme southern point of mainland England. It is in western Cornwall at the end of the Penwith peninsula. The O.S. Grid Reference of the road end is SW342250, Post Code TR19 7AA. In fact it, or strictly speaking Dr Syntax's Head, SW341253, a few hundred yards NW of the road end, is mainland England's most ''westerly'' point.<ref>Streetmap http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=134150&y=25450&z=0&sv=SW341254&st=5&mapp=map.srf&searchp=ids.srf</ref> The most southerly point is [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], about {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} further south. Land's End  is sometimes reckoned incorrectly as mainland England's most southwesterly point. This accolade belongs to Gwennap Head, SW365215, which is at least {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} further south than Dr Syntax's Head but only about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} less west.<ref>Streetmap http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=136650&y=21550&z=0&sv=SW366215&st=5&mapp=map.srf&searchp=ids.srf</ref>\n* [[John o' Groats]] is the traditionally acknowledged extreme northern point of mainland Scotland, in northeastern [[Caithness]], O.S. Grid Reference ND380735, Post Code KW1 4YR. The actual northernmost point is [[Dunnet Head]] about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} further north. The point that is farthest by road from Land's End is [[Duncansby Head]], about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} east of John o' Groats. Duncansby Head is also the most northeasterly point of the Scottish mainland.<ref>Streetmap http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=340568&y=973320&z=120&sv=340568,973320&st=4&ar=y&mapp=map.srf&searchp=ids.srf&dn=639&ax=340568&ay=973320&lm=0</ref>\n\nThe straight-line distance from Land's End to John o' Groats is {{convert|603|mi|km}} as determined from O.S. Grid References, but such a route passes over a series of stretches of water in the [[Irish Sea]].  Google Earth reports a distance of 602.70 miles between the two iconic marker points.\n\nAccording to a 1964 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was {{convert|847|mi|km}} but in a 2008 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was {{convert|838|mi|km}}. An online route planner in 2011 also calculated the quickest route by road as {{convert|838|mi|km}}, estimating a time of 15 hours 48 minutes for the journey (this uses the [[A30 road|A30]], [[M5 motorway|M5]], [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M), M74]], [[M73 motorway|M73]], [[M80 motorway|M80]], [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9]], [[A9 road (Scotland)|A9]] & [[A99 road|A99]]) but the overall shortest route by road, using minor roads in numerous places and utilising modern bridges, is only about {{convert|814|mi|km}}.  This route is roughly as follows: Land's End, [[Bodmin]], [[Okehampton]], [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], [[Taunton]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Avonmouth Bridge|the M5 Avon Bridge]], the [[M48 motorway|M48]] [[Severn Bridge]], [[Monmouth]], [[Hereford]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Tarporley]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Beattock]], [[Carstairs, South Lanarkshire|Carstairs]], [[Whitburn, West Lothian|Whitburn]], [[Falkirk]], [[Stirling]], [[Crieff]], [[Kenmore, Perth and Kinross|Kenmore]], Dalchalloch, A9, [[Inverness]], [[Kessock Bridge]], [[Cromarty Bridge]], [[Dornoch Firth Bridge]], [[Latheron]], [[Wick, Highland|Wick]], John o' Groats.\n\n[[Google Maps]], on 2 August 2017, calculated the fastest route by car, from the Land's End Visitor Centre to John o' Groats as being 837 miles and taking 14 hours 40 minutes.  It also showed a walking route of 811 miles, which it suggested would take 268 hours, and involve an elevation gain of 30,148 ft and an elevation fall of 30,272 ft.\n\n== Methods ==\n\nThere are many ways to go from Land's End to John o' Groats. Traditionally considered to be a walk, the route is now traversed in a number of ways, with cycling and multi-modal expeditions being particularly popular in recent years.\n\nMost trips are done by individuals or small groups for personal fulfilment. Some expeditions are organised as charity fundraisers, sometimes involving celebrities: examples include cricketer [[Ian Botham]]'s 1985 walk and athlete [[Jane Tomlinson]] in 2003. In recent history the route has been used as a rite of passage by cyclists taking on the most iconic cycling challenge in Britain.\n\n=== Walking ===\nThe first recorded end-to-end walk (actually from John o' Groats to Land's End) was undertaken by the brothers John and Robert Naylor in 1871.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14415 |title=Naylor, J. and R. (1916) '&#39;From John o' Groats to Land's End'&#39; on Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=22 December 2004 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>  Since then the walk has been undertaken many times, more particularly since 1960, after a well-publicised road walk by [[Barbara Moore (vegetarian)|Dr Barbara Moore]].  In 1960 the entrepreneur [[Billy Butlin]] organised a road walking race, which gave further impetus to the idea.\n\nSince the 1960s, walkers have mostly chosen off-road routes, using the growing network of [[long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom|long-distance footpaths]].  A classic account is from 1966 by the travel writer [[John Hillaby]].<ref>Hillaby, J. (1966) ''Journey Through Britain'' Republished by Constable in 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-09-474990-0}}</ref> Off-road walkers usually complete the journey in two to three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually {{convert|1200|mi|km}} or more.  The walk is still undertaken by road walkers, often doing the walk, like [[Sir Ian Botham]], for charity, or as a \"challenge walk\".  They typically take a month or even less.\n\nSome walkers aim to complete the route piecemeal, perhaps over several years, to achieve the walk within the time constraints of a working life and before the possible health problems of retirement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=John|title=End to end in bits : a story of a walk from Lands End to John O'Groats|date=2011|publisher=Alewords|location=Leeds|isbn=0951904760|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/163212607/Final-Version-of-End-to-End}}</ref>\n\n==== Routes ====\n\nThere is no continuous long-distance path from Land's End to John o' Groats.  There are long-distance paths for substantial sections of the route, and where they do not exist walkers connect them by [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] and minor roads.

These events were also known as the End to End. In 2006, [[BBC Television]] ran a series of three programmes called ''[[The Lost World of Friese-Greene]]'' covering [[Claude Friese-Greene]]'s 1920s-era road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats.  The trip had originally been filmed using the Biocolour process, developed by Claude's father [[William Friese-Greene]] and the film had degraded. The original print of Claude's film was subjected to computer enhancement by the [[British Film Institute]] to remove the flickering problem inherent in the Biocolour process.\n\nIn September 1983 rally and trials driver Dennis Greenslade from Cornwall created a new sole driver non-stop record drive from Land's End to John O'Groats and return using the newly released Audi 80 Quattro.

The traditional distance by road is {{convert|874|mi|km}} and takes most cyclists 10 to 14 days; the record for running the route is nine days. Off-road walkers typically walk about {{convert|1200|mi|km}} and take two or three months for the expedition.  Two much-photographed signposts indicate the traditional distance at each end.\n\n* [[Land's End]] is the traditionally acknowledged extreme southern point of mainland England. It is in western Cornwall at the end of the Penwith peninsula. The O.S. Grid Reference of the road end is SW342250, Post Code TR19 7AA. In fact it, or strictly speaking Dr Syntax's Head, SW341253, a few hundred yards NW of the road end, is mainland England's most ''westerly'' point.<ref>Streetmap http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=134150&y=25450&z=0&sv=SW341254&st=5&mapp=map.srf&searchp=ids.srf</ref> The most southerly point is [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], about {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} further south.

Grid Reference ND380735, Post Code KW1 4YR. The actual northernmost point is [[Dunnet Head]] about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} further north. The point that is farthest by road from Land's End is [[Duncansby Head]], about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} east of John o' Groats.

Grid References, but such a route passes over a series of stretches of water in the [[Irish Sea]].  Google Earth reports a distance of 602.70 miles between the two iconic marker points.\n\nAccording to a 1964 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was {{convert|847|mi|km}} but in a 2008 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was {{convert|838|mi|km}}. An online route planner in 2011 also calculated the quickest route by road as {{convert|838|mi|km}}, estimating a time of 15 hours 48 minutes for the journey (this uses the [[A30 road|A30]], [[M5 motorway|M5]], [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M), M74]], [[M73 motorway|M73]], [[M80 motorway|M80]], [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9]], [[A9 road (Scotland)|A9]] & [[A99 road|A99]]) but the overall shortest route by road, using minor roads in numerous places and utilising modern bridges, is only about {{convert|814|mi|km}}.  This route is roughly as follows: Land's End, [[Bodmin]], [[Okehampton]], [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], [[Taunton]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Avonmouth Bridge|the M5 Avon Bridge]], the [[M48 motorway|M48]] [[Severn Bridge]], [[Monmouth]], [[Hereford]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Tarporley]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Beattock]], [[Carstairs, South Lanarkshire|Carstairs]], [[Whitburn, West Lothian|Whitburn]], [[Falkirk]], [[Stirling]], [[Crieff]], [[Kenmore, Perth and Kinross|Kenmore]], Dalchalloch, A9, [[Inverness]], [[Kessock Bridge]], [[Cromarty Bridge]], [[Dornoch Firth Bridge]], [[Latheron]], [[Wick, Highland|Wick]], John o' Groats.\n\n[[Google Maps]], on 2 August 2017, calculated the fastest route by car, from the Land's End Visitor Centre to John o' Groats as being 837 miles and taking 14 hours 40 minutes.  It also showed a walking route of 811 miles, which it suggested would take 268 hours, and involve an elevation gain of 30,148 ft and an elevation fall of 30,272 ft.\n\n== Methods ==\n\nThere are many ways to go from Land's End to John o' Groats. Traditionally considered to be a walk, the route is now traversed in a number of ways, with cycling and multi-modal expeditions being particularly popular in recent years.\n\nMost trips are done by individuals or small groups for personal fulfilment. Some expeditions are organised as charity fundraisers, sometimes involving celebrities: examples include cricketer [[Ian Botham]]'s 1985 walk and athlete [[Jane Tomlinson]] in 2003. In recent history the route has been used as a rite of passage by cyclists taking on the most iconic cycling challenge in Britain.\n\n=== Walking ===\nThe first recorded end-to-end walk (actually from John o' Groats to Land's End) was undertaken by the brothers John and Robert Naylor in 1871.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14415 |title=Naylor, J. and R. (1916) '&#39;From John o' Groats to Land's End'&#39; on Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=22 December 2004 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>  Since then the walk has been undertaken many times, more particularly since 1960, after a well-publicised road walk by [[Barbara Moore (vegetarian)|Dr Barbara Moore]].  In 1960 the entrepreneur [[Billy Butlin]] organised a road walking race, which gave further impetus to the idea.\n\nSince the 1960s, walkers have mostly chosen off-road routes, using the growing network of [[long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom|long-distance footpaths]].  A classic account is from 1966 by the travel writer [[John Hillaby]].<ref>Hillaby, J. (1966) ''Journey Through Britain'' Republished by Constable in 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-09-474990-0}}</ref> Off-road walkers usually complete the journey in two to three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually {{convert|1200|mi|km}} or more.  The walk is still undertaken by road walkers, often doing the walk, like [[Sir Ian Botham]], for charity, or as a \"challenge walk\".  They typically take a month or even less.\n\nSome walkers aim to complete the route piecemeal, perhaps over several years, to achieve the walk within the time constraints of a working life and before the possible health problems of retirement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=John|title=End to end in bits : a story of a walk from Lands End to John O'Groats|date=2011|publisher=Alewords|location=Leeds|isbn=0951904760|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/163212607/Final-Version-of-End-to-End}}</ref>\n\n==== Routes ====\n\nThere is no continuous long-distance path from Land's End to John o' Groats.  There are long-distance paths for substantial sections of the route, and where they do not exist walkers connect them by [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] and minor roads.

It was first adapted during the [[Russian Revolution]], the hammer representing the workers and the [[sickle]] representing the [[peasants]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics|title=Flag of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|language=en|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] (from which [[Russian Empire|Russia]] withdrew in the year 1917) and the [[Russian Civil War]], the hammer and sickle became more widely used as a symbol for labor within the [[Soviet Union]] and for [[Proletarian internationalism|international proletarian unity]]. It was taken up by many [[History of communism|communist movements]] around the world, some with local variations. Today, even after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the hammer and sickle remains commonplace in [[Russia]] and other [[Post-Soviet states|former union republics]], but its display is [[Decommunization|prohibited]] in some other former [[communist countries]] as well as in countries where [[communism]] is [[Bans on Communist symbols|banned]] by law. The hammer and sickle also remains commonplace in countries like [[Vietnam]] and [[China]] which are still officially communist states.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Peso_Chileno_1933.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[chilean peso]] used the hammer and sickle symbol between 1895 and 1940]]\n\n=== Worker symbolism ===\nFarm and worker instruments and tools have long been used as symbols for [[Proletariat|proletarian]] struggle.\n\nThe combination of hammer and sickle symbolised the combination of farmers and construction workers. One example of use prior to its political instrumentalisation by the Soviet Union is found in [[Chilean peso|Chilean currency]] circulating since 1895.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chilean peso design, 1894|url=http://www.moneta-coins.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=598&title=chile-1894-pattern|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative example is the combination of a hammer and a [[plough]], with the same meaning (unity of peasants and workers). In Ireland, the symbol of the plough remains in use. The [[Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] banner was originally used by the [[Irish Citizen Army]], a socialist republican workers' militia. [[James Connolly]], co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with [[Jack White (trade unionist)|Jack White]], said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. A sword is forged into the plough to symbolise the end of war with the establishment of a Socialist International. This was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].\n\n[[File:Starry Plough flag (1914).svg|thumb|150px|The [[Starry Plough (flag)|Plough flag]] from 1914 and flown during the [[Easter Rising]]]]\n\n=== Inception ===\nIn 1917, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] held a competition to create a Soviet emblem. The winning design was a hammer and sickle on top of a globe in rays of the sun, surrounded by a wreath of grain and under a five-pointed star, with the inscription \"[[Workers of the world, unite!|proletariats of the world, unite!]]\" in six languages ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]). It originally featured a sword, but Lenin strongly objected, disliking the violent connotations.<ref name=\"HS Role and Symbolism\">{{cite web|title=The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution|url=https://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/?parent=2514&detail=4475&content=4797|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> The winning designer was [[Yevgeny Ivanovich Kamzolkin]] (1885\u20131957).<ref>[http://1965tribunal.org/the-spectre-of-hammer-and-sickle/ International People's Tribunal 1965, \"The Spectre of Hammer and Sickle\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914194725/http://1965tribunal.org/the-spectre-of-hammer-and-sickle/ |date=14 September 2015 }}. {{retrieved|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.picture-russia.com/en/painter/582 International Gallery of Contemporary Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816163416/http://www.picture-russia.com/en/painter/582|date=16 August 2016}}. {{retrieved|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 July 1923, the 2nd session of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] (CIK) adopted this emblem.<ref name=\"HS Role and Symbolism\"/>\n\n=== Usage in the Soviet Union ===\n* The [[Coat of Arms of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Coats of Arms of the Soviet Republics]] showed the hammer and sickle, which also appeared on the [[red star]] badge on the uniform cap of the [[Red Army]] uniform and in many other places.\n* ''Serp i Molot'' ([[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]] of {{lang-ru|c\u0435\u0440\u043f \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442}}, \"sickle and hammer\") is the name of the [[Moscow Metallurgical Plant]].\n* ''Serp i Molot'' is also the name of a stop on the [[electric railway]] line from Kurski [[railway station]] in [[Moscow]] to [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]], featured in [[Venedikt Yerofeyev]]'s novel, ''[[Moscow-Petushki]]''.\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of the Soviet Union 1923\u20131936.svg|thumb|150px|The first [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]] (1923\u20131936)]]\n\n== Meaning ==\nAt the time of creation, the hammer and sickle stood for worker-peasant alliance, with the hammer a traditional symbol of the industrial proletariat (who dominated the proletariat of Russia) and the sickle a traditional symbol for the peasantry, but the meaning has since broadened to a globally recognizable symbol for [[Marxism]], [[Communist party|Marxist parties]], or [[socialist state]]s.<ref name=\"HS Role and Symbolism\"/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle came to take on a gendered meaning, with the sickle coming to be associated with women and the hammer men.<ref name=\"HS Role and Symbolism\"/>\n\nContrary to the popular belief, the symbol is also widely used as a [[World War II]] resistance symbol against Nazism in which the Soviet soldiers and citizens died during the war.\n\n== Current usage ==\n=== Post-Soviet states ===\n[[File:Flag of Transnistria (state).svg|thumb|The flag of [[Transnistria]] is based on the flag formerly used by the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]]]\n[[File:Flag of Oryol (city).svg|thumb|The flag of [[Oryol]] incorporates the flag formerly used by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]]]\nTwo federal subjects of the post-Soviet Russian Federation use the hammer and sickle in their symbols: the [[Vladimir Oblast]] has them on its flag and the [[Bryansk Oblast]] has them on its flag and coat of arms, which is also the central element of its flag. In addition, the Russian city of [[Oryol]] also uses the hammer and sickle on its flag.\n\nThe former Soviet (now Russian) national airline, [[Aeroflot]], continues to use the hammer and sickle in its symbol.\n\nThe hammer and sickle can be found as a logo on most [[ushanka]] hats, usually the Soviet-styled ones.\n\nThe ''de facto'' government of [[Transnistria]] uses (with minor modifications) the flag and the emblem of the former [[Moldavian SSR]], which includes the hammer and sickle. The flag can also appear without the hammer and sickle in some circumstances, for example on Transnistrian-issued [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]].\n\n=== Communist parties ===\nThree out of the five currently ruling Communist parties use a hammer and sickle as the party symbol: the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. All of these use the yellow-on-red colour scheme. In Laos and Vietnam, the hammer and sickle party flags can often be seen flying side-by-side with their respective national flags.\n\nMany communist parties around the world also use it, including the [[Communist Party of Greece]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kke.gr/|title=KKE - \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|work=kke.gr}}</ref>, the [[Communist Party of Chile]], the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], the [[Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party]] from Bangladesh, the [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka]], the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) Liberation]], the [[Communist Party of India]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]], the Indian [[Communist Marxist Party]], the [[Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)]], the [[Egyptian Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]], the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]], the [[Communist Party of Denmark]], the [[Nepal Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Norway]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]], the [[Lebanese Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and the [[Shining Path]]. The [[Communist Party (Sweden)|Communist Party of Sweden]], the [[Portuguese Communist Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcp.pt/estatutos-do-pcp#cap_13|title=Estatutos do PCP, art. 72|work=pcp.pt/estatutos-do-pcp}}</ref>  and the [[Mexican Communist Party]] use the hammer and sickle imposed on the red star. The hammer and sickle accompanied by the yellow star is used by the [[Communist Refoundation Party]], the main communist party in Italy.\n\n== Variations ==\nMany symbols having similar structures and messages to the original have been designed. For example, the [[flag of Angola|Angolan flag]] shows a segment of a [[gear|cog]], crossed by a [[machete]] and crowned with a [[red star|socialist star]] while the [[flag of Mozambique]] features an [[AK-47]] crossed by a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. In the logo of the [[Communist Party USA]], a circle is formed by a half cog and a [[Semicircle|semicircular]] sickle-blade. A hammer is laid directly over the sickle's handle with the hammer's [[Hammer#Designs and variations|head]] at the logo's center. The logo of the [[Communist Party of Turkey (current)|Communist Party of Turkey]] consists of half a cog wheel crossed by a hammer, with a star on the top.\n\nTools represented in other designs include: the [[Ink brush|brush]], sickle and hammer of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]; the [[spade]], [[torch|flaming torch]] and [[quill]] used prior to 1984 by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (which is a socialist and not a communist party); the [[pickaxe]] and [[rifle]] used in [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|communist Albania]]; and the hammer and [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]] of the [[East Germany|East German]] emblem and flag. The [[Far Eastern Republic]] of Russia used an [[anchor]] crossed over a spade or pickaxe, symbolising the union of the fishermen and miners. The [[Fourth International]], founded by [[Leon Trotsky]], uses a hammer and sickle symbol on which the number 4 is superimposed. The hammer and sickle in the Fourth International symbol are the opposite of other hammer and sickle symbols in that the head of the hammer is on the right side and the sickle end tip on the left. The [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[League for the Fifth International]] merges a hammer with the number 5, using the number's lower arch to form the sickle. A sickle with a rifle is also used by the Marxist and Islamist group [[People's Mojahedin of Iran]].\n\nThe [[Communist Party of Britain]] (CGB) uses the hammer and [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|dove symbol]]. Designed in 1988 by Michal Boncza, it is intended to highlight the party's connection to the peace movement. It is usually used in conjunction with the hammer and sickle and it appears on all of the CPB's publications. Some members of the CPB prefer one symbol over the other, although the party's 1994 congress reaffirmed the hammer and dove's position as the official emblem of the party. Similarly, the [[Communist Party of Israel]] uses a dove over the hammer and sickle as its symbol. The flag of the [[Guadeloupe Communist Party]] uses a sickle, turned to look like a [[capital letters|majuscule G]], to represent [[Guadeloupe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/gp%7Dpcg.html|title=Parti Communiste Guadeloup\u00e9en|work=flagspot.net}}</ref>\n\nThe flag of the [[Black Front]], a [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] group founded by early Nazi Party members and expelled around the time of the [[Night of the Long Knives]] purge, along with his supporters and the [[Sturmabteilung]] and originator of the ideology and the Black Front himself [[Otto Strasser]], featured a crossed hammer and sword, symbolizing the unity of the workers and military.\n\nThe [[flag of Burma]] (from 1974\u20132010) featured a bushel of [[rice]] superimposed on a [[cogwheel]].\n\nThe flag of [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, Party of the Revolution in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]), currently the ruling political party of [[Tanzania]], has a slightly different symbol with a hammer and a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] (''jembe'') instead of a sickle to represent the most common farm tool in Africa.\n\nThe [[National Bolshevik Party]] used the hammer and sickle in their flag, but colored black instead of gold and in a design similar to the [[Nazi flag]], a brighter red flag than the USSR, with a black hammer and sickle on a white disk in the center.\n\n== Art ==\nThe hammer and sickle has long been a common theme in socialist realism, but it has also seen some depiction in non-Marxist popular culture. [[Andy Warhol]] who created many drawings and photographs of the hammer and sickle is the most famous example of this.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Lenpl_06.jpg|The metro station, ''Ploshchad Lenina'', [[Minsk]]\nFile:BWHammerSickle.jpg|S\u00e1ndor Pinczehelyi, ''Hammer and Sickle''\nFile:Hammer and Sickle - Kerala.jpg|A [[Tableau vivant|tableau]] in a communist rally in [[Kerala]], [[India]]\nFile:Moscow_Statue_-_panoramio.jpg|''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', [[Moscow]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Legal status ==\n{{see also|Red star#Legal status|l1=Red star \u00a7 Legal status|Bans on Communist symbols}}\nIn several countries in the former [[Eastern Bloc]], there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a \"[[totalitarian]] and criminal ideology\" and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence.

It was first adapted during the [[Russian Revolution]], the hammer representing the workers and the [[sickle]] representing the [[peasants]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics|title=Flag of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|language=en|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] (from which [[Russian Empire|Russia]] withdrew in the year 1917) and the [[Russian Civil War]], the hammer and sickle became more widely used as a symbol for labor within the [[Soviet Union]] and for [[Proletarian internationalism|international proletarian unity]]. It was taken up by many [[History of communism|communist movements]] around the world, some with local variations. Today, even after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the hammer and sickle remains commonplace in [[Russia]] and other [[Post-Soviet states|former union republics]], but its display is [[Decommunization|prohibited]] in some other former [[communist countries]] as well as in countries where [[communism]] is [[Bans on Communist symbols|banned]] by law. The hammer and sickle also remains commonplace in countries like [[Vietnam]] and [[China]] which are still officially communist states.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Peso_Chileno_1933.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[chilean peso]] used the hammer and sickle symbol between 1895 and 1940]]\n\n=== Worker symbolism ===\nFarm and worker instruments and tools have long been used as symbols for [[Proletariat|proletarian]] struggle.\n\nThe combination of hammer and sickle symbolised the combination of farmers and construction workers. One example of use prior to its political instrumentalisation by the Soviet Union is found in [[Chilean peso|Chilean currency]] circulating since 1895.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chilean peso design, 1894|url=http://www.moneta-coins.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=598&title=chile-1894-pattern|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative example is the combination of a hammer and a [[plough]], with the same meaning (unity of peasants and workers). In Ireland, the symbol of the plough remains in use. The [[Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]] banner was originally used by the [[Irish Citizen Army]], a socialist republican workers' militia. [[James Connolly]], co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with [[Jack White (trade unionist)|Jack White]], said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. A sword is forged into the plough to symbolise the end of war with the establishment of a Socialist International. This was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].\n\n[[File:Starry Plough flag (1914).svg|thumb|150px|The [[Starry Plough (flag)|Plough flag]] from 1914 and flown during the [[Easter Rising]]]]\n\n=== Inception ===\nIn 1917, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] held a competition to create a Soviet emblem. The winning design was a hammer and sickle on top of a globe in rays of the sun, surrounded by a wreath of grain and under a five-pointed star, with the inscription \"[[Workers of the world, unite!|proletariats of the world, unite!]]\" in six languages ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]).

In addition, the Russian city of [[Oryol]] also uses the hammer and sickle on its flag.\n\nThe former Soviet (now Russian) national airline, [[Aeroflot]], continues to use the hammer and sickle in its symbol.\n\nThe hammer and sickle can be found as a logo on most [[ushanka]] hats, usually the Soviet-styled ones.\n\nThe ''de facto'' government of [[Transnistria]] uses (with minor modifications) the flag and the emblem of the former [[Moldavian SSR]], which includes the hammer and sickle. The flag can also appear without the hammer and sickle in some circumstances, for example on Transnistrian-issued [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]].\n\n=== Communist parties ===\nThree out of the five currently ruling Communist parties use a hammer and sickle as the party symbol: the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] and the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. All of these use the yellow-on-red colour scheme. In Laos and Vietnam, the hammer and sickle party flags can often be seen flying side-by-side with their respective national flags.\n\nMany communist parties around the world also use it, including the [[Communist Party of Greece]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kke.gr/|title=KKE - \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|work=kke.gr}}</ref>, the [[Communist Party of Chile]], the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], the [[Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party]] from Bangladesh, the [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka]], the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) Liberation]], the [[Communist Party of India]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]], the Indian [[Communist Marxist Party]], the [[Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)]], the [[Egyptian Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]], the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]], the [[Communist Party of Denmark]], the [[Nepal Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of Norway]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]], the [[Lebanese Communist Party]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and the [[Shining Path]].

The hammer and sickle accompanied by the yellow star is used by the [[Communist Refoundation Party]], the main communist party in Italy.\n\n== Variations ==\nMany symbols having similar structures and messages to the original have been designed. For example, the [[flag of Angola|Angolan flag]] shows a segment of a [[gear|cog]], crossed by a [[machete]] and crowned with a [[red star|socialist star]] while the [[flag of Mozambique]] features an [[AK-47]] crossed by a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. In the logo of the [[Communist Party USA]], a circle is formed by a half cog and a [[Semicircle|semicircular]] sickle-blade. A hammer is laid directly over the sickle's handle with the hammer's [[Hammer#Designs and variations|head]] at the logo's center. The logo of the [[Communist Party of Turkey (current)|Communist Party of Turkey]] consists of half a cog wheel crossed by a hammer, with a star on the top.\n\nTools represented in other designs include: the [[Ink brush|brush]], sickle and hammer of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]; the [[spade]], [[torch|flaming torch]] and [[quill]] used prior to 1984 by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (which is a socialist and not a communist party); the [[pickaxe]] and [[rifle]] used in [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|communist Albania]]; and the hammer and [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]] of the [[East Germany|East German]] emblem and flag. The [[Far Eastern Republic]] of Russia used an [[anchor]] crossed over a spade or pickaxe, symbolising the union of the fishermen and miners. The [[Fourth International]], founded by [[Leon Trotsky]], uses a hammer and sickle symbol on which the number 4 is superimposed. The hammer and sickle in the Fourth International symbol are the opposite of other hammer and sickle symbols in that the head of the hammer is on the right side and the sickle end tip on the left. The [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[League for the Fifth International]] merges a hammer with the number 5, using the number's lower arch to form the sickle. A sickle with a rifle is also used by the Marxist and Islamist group [[People's Mojahedin of Iran]].\n\nThe [[Communist Party of Britain]] (CGB) uses the hammer and [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|dove symbol]]. Designed in 1988 by Michal Boncza, it is intended to highlight the party's connection to the peace movement. It is usually used in conjunction with the hammer and sickle and it appears on all of the CPB's publications. Some members of the CPB prefer one symbol over the other, although the party's 1994 congress reaffirmed the hammer and dove's position as the official emblem of the party. Similarly, the [[Communist Party of Israel]] uses a dove over the hammer and sickle as its symbol. The flag of the [[Guadeloupe Communist Party]] uses a sickle, turned to look like a [[capital letters|majuscule G]], to represent [[Guadeloupe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/gp%7Dpcg.html|title=Parti Communiste Guadeloup\u00e9en|work=flagspot.net}}</ref>\n\nThe flag of the [[Black Front]], a [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] group founded by early Nazi Party members and expelled around the time of the [[Night of the Long Knives]] purge, along with his supporters and the [[Sturmabteilung]] and originator of the ideology and the Black Front himself [[Otto Strasser]], featured a crossed hammer and sword, symbolizing the unity of the workers and military.\n\nThe [[flag of Burma]] (from 1974\u20132010) featured a bushel of [[rice]] superimposed on a [[cogwheel]].\n\nThe flag of [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, Party of the Revolution in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]), currently the ruling political party of [[Tanzania]], has a slightly different symbol with a hammer and a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] (''jembe'') instead of a sickle to represent the most common farm tool in Africa.\n\nThe [[National Bolshevik Party]] used the hammer and sickle in their flag, but colored black instead of gold and in a design similar to the [[Nazi flag]], a brighter red flag than the USSR, with a black hammer and sickle on a white disk in the center.\n\n== Art ==\nThe hammer and sickle has long been a common theme in socialist realism, but it has also seen some depiction in non-Marxist popular culture. [[Andy Warhol]] who created many drawings and photographs of the hammer and sickle is the most famous example of this.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Lenpl_06.jpg|The metro station, ''Ploshchad Lenina'', [[Minsk]]\nFile:BWHammerSickle.jpg|S\u00e1ndor Pinczehelyi, ''Hammer and Sickle''\nFile:Hammer and Sickle - Kerala.jpg|A [[Tableau vivant|tableau]] in a communist rally in [[Kerala]], [[India]]\nFile:Moscow_Statue_-_panoramio.jpg|''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', [[Moscow]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Legal status ==\n{{see also|Red star#Legal status|l1=Red star \u00a7 Legal status|Bans on Communist symbols}}\nIn several countries in the former [[Eastern Bloc]], there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a \"[[totalitarian]] and criminal ideology\" and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence.

{"title_page": "Lalita Sahasranama", "text_new": "{{Hindu scriptures}}\n'''Lalita [[Sahasranama]]''' (IAST: lalit\u0101sahasran\u0101ma) (Sanskrit: \u0932\u0932\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u0928\u093e\u092e), also known as the ''Lalitha Sahasranamam'', is a [[Hindus|Hindu]] text from the [[Brahmanda Purana]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tagare|first=G.V.|title=The Brahmanda Purana|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brahmanda-purana|year=1958|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Pvt.|isbn=9788120838246|page=1464}}</ref> The ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is the thousand names of the Hindu mother goddess Lalita. It is a sacred text for the Hindu worshippers of the [[Tripura Sundari|Goddess Lalita Devi]], who considered to be a manifestation of the [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]] ([[Shakti]]), and the text is therefore used in the worship of [[Durga]], [[Parvati]], [[Kali]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswati]], [[Bhagavati]], etc. as well. A principal text of [[Shaktism|Shakti worshipers]], it names the goddess's various attributes in the form of names organized in a [[hymn]]. This ''sahasranama'' is used in various modes for the worship of the Divine Mother like ''parayana'' (recitations), [[Archana (Hinduism)|archana]], and [[Homa (ritual)|homa]].\n\n== Etymology and Structure ==\n{{Saktism}}\nThe names are organized as hymns, or [[Stotras|''stotras'']]'','' but are often broken into [[Mantra|mantras]] to represent all 1000 names. Therefore the ''Sahasranama'' can be chanted in stotra form, or namavali form. ''The Lalitha Saharanama'' is one of the only ''sahasranamas'' that does not repeat a single name.\n\nGenerally, ''sahasranama''s use the artifice of adding words like ''tu'', ''api'', ''ca'', and ''hi'', which are conjunctions that do not necessarily add to the meaning of the name except in cases of interpretation. The ''Lalita Sahasranama'' does not use any such auxiliary conjunctions and is unique in being an enumeration of holy names that meets the metrical, poetical and mystic requirements of a ''sahasranama'' by their order throughout the text.\n\nEtymologically, \"''Lalita''\" means \"''She Who Plays''.\" In its root form, the word \"''Lalita''\" means \"''spontaneous''\" from which the meaning \"''easy''\" is derived and implicitly extends to \"''play''\".\n\n== Composition ==\nThe ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is said to have been composed by the eight ''vaag'' [[Devi|devis]](''Vasini'', ''Kameshvari'', ''Aruna'', ''Vimala'', ''Jayani'', ''Modini'', ''Sarveshvari'', and ''Kaulini'') upon the command of the goddess Lalita herself. The ''sahasranama'' says that \"''One can worship Lalitha only if she wishes us to do so.''\" This ''stotra'' occurs in the [[Brahmanda Purana]] (history of the universe) in the chapter of discussion between [[Hayagreeva|Hayagriva]] and Sage [[Agasthya|Agastya]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tagare|first=G.V.|title=Lalitopakhyana (chapters 41-44)|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/lalitopakhyana-lalita-mahatmya/d/doc362983.html|year=1958|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Pvt.|isbn=9788120838246|page=1464}}</ref> Hayagriva is an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] with the head of a horse and is held to be the storehouse of knowledge. Agastya is one of the sages of yore and one of the stars of the constellation [[Saptarishi]] ([[Ursa major]]). At the request of Agastya, Hayagriva is said to have taught him the thousand holiest names of Lalita. The [[Tirumeeyachur Mehanadhar Temple|temple at Thirumeyachur]], near [[Kumbakonam]], is said to be where Agastya was initiated into this ''sahasranama''. An alternative origin is that the ''Upanishad Bramham Mutt'' at [[Kanchipuram]] is where this initiation happened.\n\n== Key Concepts ==\n\n=== '''Dhyana''' ===\nThe start of the ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is characterized by the ''Dhyana'', which are descriptive verses for visualization. There are four ''dhyana'' verses. It describes the [[yogi]](the person reciting the ''Sahasranama'') as meditating upon the form of Lalita and describes the many of the qualities of the goddess. The ''Dhyana'' is said before chanting the thousand names.\n\nThe first verse starts with \"''sinduraruna-vigraham\"'' and is most likely is the verse composed by the eight ''Vaag Devi''s. The second verse beginning with \"''arunam karuna-tarangatakshim\"'' is said to have been composed by [[Dattatreya]]''.'' The fourth, beginning with \"''sakumkuma-vilepanam\"'' was probably composed by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Sankaracharya]]. No known information is available on the origins of the third verse beginning with \"''dhyayet padmasanastham.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/lalitha-sahasranama-introduction-dhyana-verses|title=Lalitha Sahasranama - Introduction to Dhyana Verses|website=www.manblunder.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> In all the ''dhyana'' verses there is a recurring theme on Devi's red complexion, which is said to resemble the sun at dawn, and her compassionate nature.\n\n=== '''Lalita''' ===\nThe ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is organized in such a way that Devi is described from \"Head to Toe\" (''Kesadi Padam''). The names then go on to extoll Devi in all her achievements, powers, and forms.\n\n==== '''Physical Description''' ====\nThe ''Lalita Sahasranama'' goes into great detail describing the physical aspect of the goddess. The beginning of the ''Sahasranama'' describes Lalita in her female form, ''Kameshvari'', along with her consort, ''Kameshvara''. ''Kameshvari'' is described as extremely beautiful, having dark thick long hair adorned with [[champaka]], ''ashoka'', ''punnaga'' and ''saugandha'' flowers (13), having a musk [[Tilaka|tilak]] on her forehead (16), and having eyebrows which appear as if they are the arch gates of [[Kamadeva]]'s abode (17). The next few mantras continue describing Lalita Devi as the ideal feminine form whose splendor is unmatched by any other celestial: with cheeks that shine like a mirror of [[Padmaraga]] (23), having beautiful white teeth resembling the ''shodasakshari'' mantra (25), and having a voice sweeter than the sound emanating from ''Kachchapi'', the [[veena]] of [[Saraswati]]. The last mantra describing Devi's physical appearance is the 46th name, \"''sinjana mani majira mandita sripadambuja''\" (whose feet are adorned with musical anklets filled with gem stones).\n\n==== '''Kameshvara and Kameshvari''' ====\nThe next few names then continue to focus on the union between Lalita as ''Kameshvari,'' and ''Kameshwara''. Devi is described as having a beautiful smile (28), beautiful breasts (33), and perfect thighs (39) which steal the heart of Kameshvara; she wears a [[Mangala sutra|mangal sutra]] and necklaces (30), with succeeding names describing the lower half of Devi's body to her feet. This divine couple continues to stay united throughout the ''Sahasranama''; the penultimate name is \"''sivasakti aikya rupini\"'' (who is the unification of [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti]]). As per [[Hindu philosophy]], it is understood that there is nothing beyond this union of Siva and Shakti, or the Absolute form, except the true goddess Lalita herself. This is why the last name of the ''Sahasranama'' is \"''lalitambika\"'' effectively showing that Devi's form as ''Lalitambika'' is her most absolute form.\n\n=== The City of Sri Nagara ===\n\n==== '''Origins''' ====\nAt the behest of name 57, the divine city of ''Sri Nagara'' is described in all its splendor. The origins of the city can be traced to two different texts. One is in [[Durvasa|Durvasa's]]''Lalithastavaratna'', saying that ''Sri Nagara'' was constructed by celestial architect [[Vishvakarman|Visvakarma]]. The other, in the ''Rudra Yamala'' (as told to ''[[Parvati]]'' by ''[[Shiva]]''), says that ''Sri Nagara'' is in the midst of an [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]] as an island called ''Ratnadvipa'' (island formed out of precious gems). This description fits name 61, \"''sudha sagara madhyasta,''\" which describes Devi as residing in the middle of the ocean of nectar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/lalitha-sahasranamam-59-63|title=Lalitha Sahasranamam 59 - 63|website=www.manblunder.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Description''' ====\n''Sri Nagara'' is surrounded by twenty five walls, each wall representing a [[tattva]]. ''Sri Nagara'' has 25 streets circling it, made of elements, gems, and precious stones. In the eighth street is a forest of [[kadambas]] presided by ''Mantrini'' (60). On the fifteenth street resides the eight directional guardian deities. In the sixteenth resides [[Varahi]](alias Dandini or Dandanadha) who was Lalita's commander in chief in her battle with [[Bhandasura]]. In the seventeenth street resides the different ''Yoginis''. In the eighteenth street resides [[Maha Vishnu]]. In the nineteenth street resides ''Esana'', in the twentieth resides [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] Devi, in twenty first resides [[Varuni]], in the twenty second resides [[Kurukull\u0101|Kurukulla]] who presides over the fort of pride, in twenty third resides [[Bhairava|Marthanda Bhairava]], in twenty fourth resides the moon, and in the twenty fifth resides [[Manmatha]] presiding over the forest of love.\n\nIn the center of ''Sri Nagara'' is the ''Maha Padma Atavi'' (59), the forest of the Great Lotuses, and within it the ''Chintamani Griha'' (57), a palace constructed out of [[Cintamani]], the wish fulfilling gem.  The palace is said to be on the northern side of ''Sri Nagara;'' to its north east is the ''Chid-agni kunda'' and on both sides of its eastern gate are the houses of ''Mantrini'' and ''Dandini''. On its four gates stand the ''Chaduramnaya'' gods for watch and ward.\n\nThe [[Shri Yantra|Sri Chakra]] and Lalita herself are said to reside within the ''Chintamani Griha''. The chakra is said to be made up of the following components, all represented in its decorative features: the square representing ''Trilokya Mohanam'' (Devi as the most beautiful in the three worlds), the sixteen petaled lotus called the ''Sarvasa paripoorakam'' (Devi as the fulfiller of all desires), the eight petaled lotus called the ''Sarvasamksopanam'' (Devi as the cleanser), the sixteen cornered figure representing ''Sarva Saubhagyam'' (luck), the external ten cornered figure called the ''Sarvartha Sadhakam'' (Devi as the giver of all assets), the internal ten cornered figure called ''Sarva Raksha Karam'' (Devi as the protector), the eight cornered figure called the ''Sarva Roga Haram'' (Devi as the cure to all diseases), the triangle called the ''Sarva Siddhi Pradam'' (Devi as the giver of all powers), and the central dot known as the ''Sarvananda Mayam or the Bindu'' (Devi as pleasure). In the center of the Chakra, on the throne of the ''Pancha Brahmas'' (58) on the ''Bindu Peeta'' (380) sits [[Tripura Sundari|Maha Tripura Sundari]].\n\n=== '''Bhandasura''' ===\nOne of the main events extolled in the ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is Devi's battle with the [[asura]] [[Bhandasura]]. According to the story, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|''devas'']] prayed to Devi to kill Bhandasura. As she started for war, the ''Sahasranama'' describes her as being accompanied by the powers of various [[Shakti|shaktis]] and [[Devi|devis]] whose accomplishments are extolled in different names. Names in the ''Sahasranama'' describes ''Sampatkari Devi'' as the captain of the elephant regiment (66) and ''Aswarooda Devi'' as the captain of the cavalry (67). Lalita as [[Adi Parashakti|Para Shakti]] herself is described as riding in the [[Shri Yantra|Sri Chakra]] Chariot (''chakraraja'' or the king of chariots) in name 68. After descriptions of the battle with respects to the various shaktis, Lalita is described as decimating Bhandasura's army using the ''Paashupathastra'' weapon (81), and destroying him and his city with the ''Kameshvarastra'' weapon (82). After praises from the devas (83), she is said to have then gave life back to [[Kamadeva|Manmatha]] (Kamadeva) for the good of the world (84).\n\n=== '''The Five Works of God and the Trimurti''' ===\nIn the ''Lalitha Sahasranama'', Devi herself has been described as \"''pancha krtya parayana''\" (274). This is in reference to the five works of God (''pancha krtyam''): creation (''[[srishti]]''), protection (''[[sthiti]]''), destruction (''samharam''), hiding (''tirodhanam'') and blessing (''anugraham''). The mantras preceding name 274 describe Devi in reference to the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]]:<blockquote>264: ''Om Srishti Kartryai Namah'' // ...who is the Creator.\n\n265: ''Om Brahma Rupayai Namah'' // ...who is in the form of Brahma\n\n266: ''Om Goptryai Namah'' // ...who protects.\n\n267: ''Om Govinda Rupinyai Namah'' // ...who has assumed the form of [[Govinda]] for the preservation of the universe.\n\n268: ''Om Samharinyai Namah'' // ...who is the destroyer of the universe.\n\n269: ''Om Rudra Rupayai Namah'' // ...who has assumed the form of [[Rudra]] for the dissolution of the universe.\n\n270: ''Om Tirodhana Karyai Namah'' // ...who causes the disappearance of all things.\n\n271: ''Om Isvaryai Namah'' // ...who protects and rules everything as [[Ishvara|Ishvar(i)]].\n\n272: ''Om Sada Shivayai Namah'' // ...who causes the disappearance of all things.\n\n273: ''Om Anugraha dayai Namah'' // ...who confers blessing (in the form of liberation).</blockquote>Devi is therefore described as an aspect of [[Brahma]] while creating (''srishti),'' an aspect of [[Govinda]] ([[Vishnu]]) while sustaining (''sthiti),'' an aspect of [[Rudra]] ([[Shiva]]) during dissolution (''samhara),'' an aspect of [[Ishvara]] while concealing (thirodana), and an aspect of [[Sadashiva]] while blessing (liberating). These five entities (Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadashiva) are known as \"''pancha-brahma''\" and \"''pancha-preta.\"'' The goddess is described as \"''pancha-brahma swarupini''\" (she whose form is composed of the five Brahmas) in name 250. Such mantras are interpreted by many ''Shakti-ite'' scholars to show that Devi's power is at par with, if not superior, to the powers of the [[trimurti]]. This idea is furthered by other mantras like \"''Om panca preta manchadi sayinyai namah''\" (who reclines on a couch made of the Five Corpses) in mantra 947; this most likely references the concept of the five ''Brahmas'' as lifeless bodies when Devi performs all the five tasks, mentioned previously, herself.\n\n=== '''The Yoginis''' ===\nThe first 60 names from 475 to 534 discuss the seven [[Chakra|''chakra''s]] of ''[[kundalini]]'' ''and [[sahasrara]]''. Each ''chakra'' is presided over by a deity called a ''yogini'' (with seven in total)''.'' Lalita herself is described as being present in the form of the ''kundalini'' energy (the divine feminine energy at the [[muladhara]] chakra at the bottom of the spine). Since the ''kundalini'' energy has to transcend the other chakras to reach ''the sahasrara'' chakra (a representation of Siva or the divine masculine energy) from the ''muladhara chakra'', worshipping the respective ''yoginis'' of each chakra is paramount. Each of these ''yogini''s have their own mantras describing their complexion, armories, qualities, and sacred foods within the ''Lalita Sahasranama'' as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/lalitha-sahasranamam-introduction-to-yoginis|title=Lalitha Sahasranamam - Introduction to Yoginis|website=www.manblunder.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Devi Mahatmya]]\n* [[Mantra]]\n* [[Lakshmi]]\n* [[Parvati]]\n* [[Saraswati]]\n* [[Tripura Sundari]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*S.K.

''The Lalitha Saharanama'' is one of the only ''sahasranamas'' that does not repeat a single name.\n\nGenerally, ''sahasranama''s use the artifice of adding words like ''tu'', ''api'', ''ca'', and ''hi'', which are conjunctions that do not necessarily add to the meaning of the name except in cases of interpretation. The ''Lalita Sahasranama'' does not use any such auxiliary conjunctions and is unique in being an enumeration of holy names that meets the metrical, poetical and mystic requirements of a ''sahasranama'' by their order throughout the text.\n\nEtymologically, \"''Lalita''\" means \"''She Who Plays''.\" In its root form, the word \"''Lalita''\" means \"''spontaneous''\" from which the meaning \"''easy''\" is derived and implicitly extends to \"''play''\".\n\n== Composition ==\nThe ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is said to have been composed by the eight ''vaag'' [[Devi|devis]](''Vasini'', ''Kameshvari'', ''Aruna'', ''Vimala'', ''Jayani'', ''Modini'', ''Sarveshvari'', and ''Kaulini'') upon the command of the goddess Lalita herself. The ''sahasranama'' says that \"''One can worship Lalitha only if she wishes us to do so.''\" This ''stotra'' occurs in the [[Brahmanda Purana]] (history of the universe) in the chapter of discussion between [[Hayagreeva|Hayagriva]] and Sage [[Agasthya|Agastya]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Tagare|first=G.V.|title=Lalitopakhyana (chapters 41-44)|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/lalitopakhyana-lalita-mahatmya/d/doc362983.html|year=1958|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Pvt.|isbn=9788120838246|page=1464}}</ref>. Hayagriva is an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] with the head of a horse and is held to be the storehouse of knowledge. Agastya is one of the sages of yore and one of the stars of the constellation [[Saptarishi]] ([[Ursa major]]). At the request of Agastya, Hayagriva is said to have taught him the thousand holiest names of Lalita. The [[Tirumeeyachur Mehanadhar Temple|temple at Thirumeyachur]], near [[Kumbakonam]], is said to be where Agastya was initiated into this ''sahasranama''. An alternative origin is that the ''Upanishad Bramham Mutt'' at [[Kanchipuram]] is where this initiation happened.\n\n== Key Concepts ==\n\n=== '''Dhyana''' ===\nThe start of the ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is characterized by the ''Dhyana'', which are descriptive verses for visualization. There are four ''dhyana'' verses. It describes the [[yogi]](the person reciting the ''Sahasranama'') as meditating upon the form of Lalita and describes the many of the qualities of the goddess. The ''Dhyana'' is said before chanting the thousand names.\n\nThe first verse starts with \"''sinduraruna-vigraham\"'' and is most likely is the verse composed by the eight ''Vaag Devi''s. The second verse beginning with \"''arunam karuna-tarangatakshim\"'' is said to have been composed by [[Dattatreya]]''.'' The fourth, beginning with \"''sakumkuma-vilepanam\"'' was probably composed by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Sankaracharya]]. No known information is available on the origins of the third verse beginning with \"''dhyayet padmasanastham.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/lalitha-sahasranama-introduction-dhyana-verses|title=Lalitha Sahasranama - Introduction to Dhyana Verses|website=www.manblunder.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> In all the ''dhyana'' verses there is a recurring theme on Devi's red complexion, which is said to resemble the sun at dawn, and her compassionate nature.\n\n=== '''Lalita''' ===\nThe ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is organized in such a way that Devi is described from \"Head to Toe\" (''Kesadi Padam''). The names then go on to extoll Devi in all her achievements, powers, and forms.\n\n==== '''Physical Description''' ====\nThe ''Lalita Sahasranama'' goes into great detail describing the physical aspect of the goddess. The beginning of the ''Sahasranama'' describes Lalita in her female form, ''Kameshvari'', along with her consort, ''Kameshvara''. ''Kameshvari'' is described as extremely beautiful, having dark thick long hair adorned with [[champaka]], ''ashoka'', ''punnaga'' and ''saugandha'' flowers (13), having a musk [[Tilaka|tilak]] on her forehead (16), and having eyebrows which appear as if they are the arch gates of [[Kamadeva]]'s abode (17). The next few mantras continue describing Lalita Devi as the ideal feminine form whose splendor is unmatched by any other celestial: with cheeks that shine like a mirror of [[Padmaraga]] (23), having beautiful white teeth resembling the ''shodasakshari'' mantra (25), and having a voice sweeter than the sound emanating from ''Kachchapi'', the [[veena]] of [[Saraswati]]. The last mantra describing Devi's physical appearance is the 46th name, \"''sinjana mani majira mandita sripadambuja''\" (whose feet are adorned with musical anklets filled with gem stones).\n\n==== '''Kameshvara and Kameshvari''' ====\nThe next few names then continue to focus on the union between Lalita as ''Kameshvari,'' and ''Kameshwara''. Devi is described as having a beautiful smile (28), beautiful breasts (33), and perfect thighs (39) which steal the heart of Kameshvara; she wears a [[Mangala sutra|mangal sutra]] and necklaces (30), with succeeding names describing the lower half of Devi's body to her feet. This divine couple continues to stay united throughout the ''Sahasranama''; the penultimate name is \"''sivasakti aikya rupini\"'' (who is the unification of [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti]]). As per [[Hindu philosophy]], it is understood that there is nothing beyond this union of Siva and Shakti, or the Absolute form, except the true goddess Lalita herself. This is why the last name of the ''Sahasranama'' is \"''lalitambika\"'' effectively showing that Devi's form as ''Lalitambika'' is her most absolute form.\n\n=== The City of Sri Nagara ===\n\n==== '''Origins''' ====\nAt the behest of name 57, the divine city of ''Sri Nagara'' is described in all its splendor. The origins of the city can be traced to two different texts. One is in [[Durvasa|Durvasa's]]''Lalithastavaratna'', saying that ''Sri Nagara'' was constructed by celestial architect [[Vishvakarman|Visvakarma]]. The other, in the ''Rudra Yamala'' (as told to ''[[Parvati]]'' by ''[[Shiva]]''), says that ''Sri Nagara'' is in the midst of an [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]] as an island called ''Ratnadvipa'' (island formed out of precious gems). This description fits name 61, \"''sudha sagara madhyasta,''\" which describes Devi as residing in the middle of the ocean of nectar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/lalitha-sahasranamam-59-63|title=Lalitha Sahasranamam 59 - 63|website=www.manblunder.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Description''' ====\n''Sri Nagara'' is surrounded by twenty five walls, each wall representing a [[tattva]]. ''Sri Nagara'' has 25 streets circling it, made of elements, gems, and precious stones. In the eighth street is a forest of [[kadambas]] presided by ''Mantrini'' (60). On the fifteenth street resides the eight directional guardian deities. In the sixteenth resides [[Varahi]](alias Dandini or Dandanadha) who was Lalita's commander in chief in her battle with [[Bhandasura]]. In the seventeenth street resides the different ''Yoginis''. In the eighteenth street resides [[Maha Vishnu]]. In the nineteenth street resides ''Esana'', in the twentieth resides [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] Devi, in twenty first resides [[Varuni]], in the twenty second resides [[Kurukull\u0101|Kurukulla]] who presides over the fort of pride, in twenty third resides [[Bhairava|Marthanda Bhairava]], in twenty fourth resides the moon, and in the twenty fifth resides [[Manmatha]] presiding over the forest of love.\n\nIn the center of ''Sri Nagara'' is the ''Maha Padma Atavi'' (59), the forest of the Great Lotuses, and within it the ''Chintamani Griha'' (57), a palace constructed out of [[Cintamani]], the wish fulfilling gem.  The palace is said to be on the northern side of ''Sri Nagara;'' to its north east is the ''Chid-agni kunda'' and on both sides of its eastern gate are the houses of ''Mantrini'' and ''Dandini''. On its four gates stand the ''Chaduramnaya'' gods for watch and ward.\n\nThe [[Shri Yantra|Sri Chakra]] and Lalita herself are said to reside within the ''Chintamani Griha''. The chakra is said to be made up of the following components, all represented in its decorative features: the square representing ''Trilokya Mohanam'' (Devi as the most beautiful in the three worlds), the sixteen petaled lotus called the ''Sarvasa paripoorakam'' (Devi as the fulfiller of all desires), the eight petaled lotus called the ''Sarvasamksopanam'' (Devi as the cleanser), the sixteen cornered figure representing ''Sarva Saubhagyam'' (luck), the external ten cornered figure called the ''Sarvartha Sadhakam'' (Devi as the giver of all assets), the internal ten cornered figure called ''Sarva Raksha Karam'' (Devi as the protector), the eight cornered figure called the ''Sarva Roga Haram'' (Devi as the cure to all diseases), the triangle called the ''Sarva Siddhi Pradam'' (Devi as the giver of all powers), and the central dot known as the ''Sarvananda Mayam or the Bindu'' (Devi as pleasure). In the center of the Chakra, on the throne of the ''Pancha Brahmas'' (58) on the ''Bindu Peeta'' (380) sits [[Tripura Sundari|Maha Tripura Sundari]].\n\n=== '''Bhandasura''' ===\nOne of the main events extolled in the ''Lalita Sahasranama'' is Devi's battle with the [[asura]] [[Bhandasura]]. According to the story, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|''devas'']] prayed to Devi to kill Bhandasura. As she started for war, the ''Sahasranama'' describes her as being accompanied by the powers of various [[Shakti|shaktis]] and [[Devi|devis]] whose accomplishments are extolled in different names. Names in the ''Sahasranama'' describes ''Sampatkari Devi'' as the captain of the elephant regiment (66) and ''Aswarooda Devi'' as the captain of the cavalry (67). Lalita as [[Adi Parashakti|Para Shakti]] herself is described as riding in the [[Shri Yantra|Sri Chakra]] Chariot (''chakraraja'' or the king of chariots) in name 68. After descriptions of the battle with respects to the various shaktis, Lalita is described as decimating Bhandasura's army using the ''Paashupathastra'' weapon (81), and destroying him and his city with the ''Kameshvarastra'' weapon (82). After praises from the devas (83), she is said to have then gave life back to [[Kamadeva|Manmatha]] (Kamadeva) for the good of the world (84).\n\n=== '''The Five Works of God and the Trimurti''' ===\nIn the ''Lalitha Sahasranama'', Devi herself has been described as \"''pancha krtya parayana''\" (274). This is in reference to the five works of God (''pancha krtyam''): creation (''[[srishti]]''), protection (''[[sthiti]]''), destruction (''samharam''), hiding (''tirodhanam'') and blessing (''anugraham''). The mantras preceding name 274 describe Devi in reference to the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]]:<blockquote>264: ''Om Srishti Kartryai Namah'' // ...who is the Creator.\n\n265: ''Om Brahma Rupayai Namah'' // ...who is in the form of Brahma\n\n266: ''Om Goptryai Namah'' // ...who protects.\n\n267: ''Om Govinda Rupinyai Namah'' // ...who has assumed the form of [[Govinda]] for the preservation of the universe.\n\n268: ''Om Samharinyai Namah'' // ...who is the destroyer of the universe.\n\n269: ''Om Rudra Rupayai Namah'' // ...who has assumed the form of [[Rudra]] for the dissolution of the universe.\n\n270: ''Om Tirodhana Karyai Namah'' // ...who causes the disappearance of all things.\n\n271: ''Om Isvaryai Namah'' // ...who protects and rules everything as [[Ishvara|Ishvar(i)]].\n\n272: ''Om Sada Shivayai Namah'' // ...who causes the disappearance of all things.\n\n273: ''Om Anugraha dayai Namah'' // ...who confers blessing (in the form of liberation).</blockquote>Devi is therefore described as an aspect of [[Brahma]] while creating (''srishti),'' an aspect of [[Govinda]] ([[Vishnu]]) while sustaining (''sthiti),'' an aspect of [[Rudra]] ([[Shiva]]) during dissolution (''samhara),'' an aspect of [[Ishvara]] while concealing (thirodana), and an aspect of [[Sadashiva]] while blessing (liberating). These five entities (Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadashiva) are known as \"''pancha-brahma''\" and \"''pancha-preta.\"'' The goddess is described as \"''pancha-brahma swarupini''\" (she whose form is composed of the five Brahmas) in name 250. Such mantras are interpreted by many ''Shakti-ite'' scholars to show that Devi's power is at par with, if not superior, to the powers of the [[trimurti]]. This idea is furthered by other mantras like \"''Om panca preta manchadi sayinyai namah''\" (who reclines on a couch made of the Five Corpses) in mantra 947; this most likely references the concept of the five ''Brahmas'' as lifeless bodies when Devi performs all the five tasks, mentioned previously, herself.\n\n=== '''The Yoginis''' ===\nThe first 60 names from 475 to 534 discuss the seven [[Chakra|''chakra''s]] of ''[[kundalini]]'' ''and [[sahasrara]]''. Each ''chakra'' is presided over by a deity called a ''yogini'' (with seven in total)''.'' Lalita herself is described as being present in the form of the ''kundalini'' energy (the divine feminine energy at the [[muladhara]] chakra at the bottom of the spine). Since the ''kundalini'' energy has to transcend the other chakras to reach ''the sahasrara'' chakra (a representation of Siva or the divine masculine energy) from the ''muladhara chakra'', worshipping the respective ''yoginis'' of each chakra is paramount. Each of these ''yogini''s have their own mantras describing their complexion, armories, qualities, and sacred foods within the ''Lalita Sahasranama'' as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/lalitha-sahasranamam-introduction-to-yoginis|title=Lalitha Sahasranamam - Introduction to Yoginis|website=www.manblunder.com|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Devi Mahatmya]]\n* [[Mantra]]\n* [[Lakshmi]]\n* [[Parvati]]\n* [[Saraswati]]\n* [[Tripura Sundari]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*S.K.

[[NIV]] translation, which refers to the Dead Sea</ref>\n\nLabweh in the original [[Syriac language|Syriac]] tongue means \"heart\" or \"center\", it also has been suggested to come from the [[Arabic]] for \"lion\" or \"lioness\". The village has several archaeological sites of interest including three old caves with [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Byzantine]] [[sarcophagi]] and the remains of a temple. There are also remains of a Byzantine bastion and a Roman dam suggested to date to the reign of [[Queen Zenobia]]. Legend suggests that channels were carved through the rock to send water to her lands in [[Palmyra]], Syria.<ref name=\"Brochure\">[http://www.discoverlebanon.com/en/panoramic_views/bekaa/el_hermel/hermel-pyramid.php Ba'albeck - Al-Hermal, Bekaa - Tourist Brochure]</ref>\n\n==Labweh Springs and Labweh River==\n\nThe village is located on a hill {{convert|26|km|mi}} northeast of [[Baalbek]], which gives its name to the Labweh [[natural spring|Springs]] and Labweh River, one of the sources of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]].<ref name=\"Britain)1837\"/> The Labweh river flows for approximately {{convert|20|km}} through rocky desert.
