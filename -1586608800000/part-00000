The excerpt reads: \"There exists more than one system to overthrow our liberty. Fanaticism has raised every passion; Royalism has not yet given up its hopes, and Terrorism feels bolder than ever.\"]]\nThe term \"terrorism\" comes from French {{lang|fr|terrorisme}}, from {{lang-la|terror}}, \"great fear\", \"dread\", related to the Latin verb {{lang|la|terrere}}, \"to frighten\". The {{lang|la|terror cimbricus}} was a panic and state of emergency in Rome in response to the approach of warriors of the [[Cimbri]] tribe in 105 BCE. The French [[National Convention]] declared in September 1793 that \"terror is the order of the day\". The period 1793\u201394 is referred to as {{lang|fr|La Terreur}} ([[Reign of Terror]]). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a leader in the [[French revolution]] proclaimed in 1794 that \"Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible.\"<ref>Burgess</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee of Public Safety]] agents that enforced the policies of \"The Terror\" were referred to as \"Terrorists\".<ref>[http://www.terrorism-research.com/history/early.php Early History of Terrorism], http://Terrorism-Research.com</ref> The word \"terrorism\" was first recorded in English-language dictionaries in 1798 as meaning \"systematic use of [[Terror (politics)|terror]] as a policy\".<ref name=com>Harper</ref>\n\nAlthough the Reign of Terror was imposed by the French government, in modern times \"terrorism\" usually refers to the killing of people by non-governmental political activists for political reasons, often as a public statement. This meaning originated with Russian radicals in the 1870s. [[Sergey Nechayev]], who founded the ''[[People's Reprisal]]'' (\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430) in 1869, described himself as a \"terrorist\".<ref name=\"Crenshaw77\">Crenshaw, p.77</ref> German radicalist writer [[Johann Most]] helped popularize the modern sense of the word by dispensing \"advice for terrorists\" in the 1880s.<ref name=\"Crenshaw44\">Crenshaw, p. 44.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Myra Williamson]]: \"The meaning of \"terrorism\" has undergone a transformation. During the reign of terror a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary state against the enemies of the people.

The symbolic, normative role of criminalization is of particular importance in the case of terrorism.  The criminalization of terrorist acts expresses society's repugnance at them, invokes social censure and shame, and stigmatizes those who commit them.  Moreover, by creating and reaffirming values, criminalization may serve, in the long run, as a deterrent to terrorism, as those values are internalized.\"<ref>C.F.

First and foremost, it has the symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts.  Second, it facilitates agreement.  Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise definition of the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly.  Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation.  This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the requesting state and the requested state.  Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations.  The principle of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.<ref>C.F.

Criminal law strives to avoid emotive terms to prevent prejudice to an accused, and shuns ambiguous or subjective terms as incompatible with the principle of non-retroactivity. If the law is to admit the term, advance definition is essential on grounds of fairness, and it is not sufficient to leave definition to the unilateral interpretations of States. Legal definition could plausibly retrieve terrorism from the ideological quagmire, by severing an agreed legal meaning from the remainder of the elastic, political concept. Ultimately it must do so without criminalizing legitimate violent resistance to oppressive regimes \u2013 and becoming complicit in that oppression.<ref>Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 \"Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights\"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 11.</ref>}}\n\n====Obstacles to a comprehensive definition====\nDiaz-Paniagua has noted that, to \"create an effective legal regime against terrorism, it would be necessary to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate.<ref>See Marsavelski, A.

Cherif Bassiouni]] notes:\n{{quote|to define 'terrorism' in a way that is both all-inclusive and unambiguous is very difficult, if not impossible.  One of the principle difficulties lies in the fundamental values at stake in the acceptance or rejection of terror-inspiring violence as means of accomplishing a given goal.  The obvious and well known range of views on these issues are what makes an internationally accepted specific definition of what is loosely called 'terrorism,' a largely impossible undertaking. That is why the search for and internationally agreed upon definition may well be a futile and unnecessary effort.<ref>M. Cherif Bassiouni, \"A Policy-oriented Inquiry of 'International Terrorism'\" in: M. Cherif Bassiouni, ed., ''Legal Responses to International Terrorism: U.S. Procedural Aspects'', (Dordrecht, Boston and London: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1988) xv \u2013 xvi.)</ref>}}\nSami Zeidan, a diplomat and scholar, explained the political reasons underlying the current difficulties to define terrorism as follows:\n{{quote|There is no general consensus on the definition of terrorism. The difficulty of defining terrorism lies in the risk it entails of taking positions. The political value of the term currently prevails over its legal one. Left to its political meaning, terrorism easily falls prey to change that suits the interests of particular states at particular times. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden were once called freedom fighters (mujahideen) and backed by the CIA when they were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now they are on top of the international terrorist lists. Today, the United Nations views Palestinians as freedom fighters, struggling against the unlawful occupation of their land by Israel, and engaged in a long-established legitimate resistance, yet Israel regards them as terrorists [...] The repercussion of the current preponderance of the political over the legal value of terrorism is costly, leaving the war against terrorism selective, incomplete and ineffective.<ref>Sami Zeidan, Desperately Seeking Definition: The International Community's Quest for Identifying the Specter of Terrorism, 36 Cornell International Law Journal (2004) pp. 491-92</ref>}}\n\nIn the same vein, [[Jason Burke]], a British reporter who writes about radical [[Islamist]] activity, said:\n{{quote|There are multiple ways of defining terrorism, and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as \"the use or threat of serious violence\" to advance some kind of \"cause\". Some state clearly the kinds of group (\"sub-national\", \"non-state\") or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory, and grave problems with the use of the term persist. Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term \"war on terrorism\" is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term \"Militancy\". This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyse them in a clearer way.<ref>Jason Burke. ''Al Qaeda'', ch. 2, p. 22)</ref>}}\nThe political and emotional connotation of the term \"terrorism\" makes difficult its use in legal discourse. In this sense, Saul notes that: \n{{quote|Despite the shifting and contested meaning of \"terrorism\" over time, the peculiar semantic power of the term, beyond its literal signification, is its capacity to stigmatize, delegitimize, denigrate, and dehumanize those at whom it is directed, including political opponents. The term is ideologically and politically loaded; pejorative; implies moral, social, and value judgment; and is \"slippery and much-abused.\" In the absence of a definition of terrorism, the struggle over the representation of a violent act is a struggle over its legitimacy. The more confused a concept, the more it lends itself to opportunistic appropriation.<ref>Ben Saul, ''Defining Terrorism in International Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nHistorically, the dispute on the meaning of terrorism arose since the [[laws of war]] were first codified in 1899. The [[Martens Clause]] was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the [[Great Power]]s who considered [[francs-tireurs]] to be [[unlawful combatants]] subject to execution on capture, and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.<ref>Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V.

Indeed, the principal merit of the 'sectoral approach' is that it avoids the need to define 'terrorism' of 'terrorist acts' ... So long as the 'sectoral' approach is followed, there is no need to define terrorism; a definition would only be necessary if the punishment of the relevant offences were made conditional on the existence of a specific 'terrorist' intent; but this would be counter-productive, inasmuch as it would result in unduly restricting their suppression.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> }}\n\nFollowing this approach, the international community has adopted the following sectoral [[counter-terrorism]] conventions, open to the [[ratification]] of all states:\n\n* The 1963 [[Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft]]\n* The 1970 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]\n* The 1971 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation]]\n* The 1979 [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]]\n* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation]]\n* The 1988 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]]\n* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]\n* The 1991 [[Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Identification]]\n* The 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]].\n* The 1999 [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]]\n* The 2005 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]]\n\nAnalyzing these treaties, Andrew Byrnes observed that: \n{{quote|These conventions \u2013 all of which are described by the United Nations as part of its panoply of anti-terrorist measures \u2013 share three principal characteristics:\n\n(a) they all adopted an \"operational definition\" of a specific type of terrorist act that was defined without reference to the underlying political or ideological purpose or [[motive (law)|motivation]] of the perpetrator of the act \u2013 this reflected a [[consensus]] that there were some acts that were such a serious threat to the interests of all that they could not be justified by reference to such motives;\n\n(b) they all focused on actions by [[non-state actor]]s (individuals and organisations) and the State was seen as an active ally in the struggle against terrorism \u2013 the question of the State itself as terrorist actor was left largely to one side; and\n\n(c) they all adopted a [[criminal law]] enforcement model to address the problem, under which States would cooperate in the [[arrest|apprehension]] and prosecution of those alleged to have committed these crimes.<ref>Byrnes (2002), p. 11</ref>}}\n\nByrnes notes that \"this act-specific approach to addressing problems of terrorism in binding international treaties has continued up until relatively recently. Although political denunciation of terrorism in all its forms had continued apace, there had been no successful attempt to define 'terrorism' as such in a broad sense that was satisfactory for legal purposes.

Terrorists often use threats to:\n* Create fear among the public.\n* Try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism.\n* Get immediate publicity for their causes.}}\n\nThe new definition does not require that the act needs to be politically motivated. The FEMA also said that terrorism \"include threats of terrorism; assassinations; kidnappings; [[hijacking (disambiguation)|hijacking]]s; [[Bomb threat|bomb scare]]s and [[bomb]]ings; [[cyber attack]]s (computer-based); and the use of [[chemical weapon|chemical]], [[biological weapon|biological]], [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[radiological weapon]]s\" and also states that \"[h]igh-risk targets for acts of terrorism include military and civilian government facilities, [[international airport]]s, large [[City|cities]], and high-profile [[landmark]]s. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. Further, terrorists are capable of spreading fear by sending [[explosives]] or chemical and biological agents through the mail.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1549-20490-0802/terrorism.pdf|title=Federal Emergency Management Agency \u2014 Terrorism}}</ref>\n\n====U.S. National Counterterrorism Center====\nThe U.S. [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) define terrorism the same as United States Code 22 USC \u00a7 2656f(d)(2).

It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. (...) Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization 'terrorist' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.\"<ref name=\"Hoffman-1998-p23\"/> For this and for political reasons, many news sources (such as [[Reuters]]) avoid using this term, opting instead for less accusatory words like \"bombers\", \"militants\", etc.<ref>Staff, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/citydiary/2735455/City-Diary.html  City Diary: Reuters sticks to the facts], City Diary, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 September 2001</ref><ref>Hoffman, (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=O6QTfAkk22AC&pg=PA30&dq=Definitions+of+terrorism&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&f=false pp. 28&ndash;30]</ref>\n\nThe term has been depicted as carrying racist, [[xenophobic]] and ethnocentric connotations when used as an ethnic slur aimed at [[Arab]]s or Middle Easterners, or at someone of Arab or [[Greater Middle East]]ern descent or when used by white supremacists.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blogcritics.org/racism-against-middle-easterners-in-america/|title=Racism Against Middle Easterners In America Is Strong|magazine=[[Blogcritics]]|date=10 August 2009|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/itihaas/fullstory.php?id=14286448|title=Of attacks, fear and changed lives|publisher=Sify|accessdate=23 March 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405045220/http://www.sify.com/itihaas/fullstory.php?id=14286448|archivedate=5 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Yahya R.

[[Bruce Hoffman]], a well-known scholar, has thus noted that:\n{{quote|It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, \"Political terrorism: A Research Guide,\" Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in a effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the \"search for an adequate definition is still on\" Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. \"Ten years of debates on typologies and definitions,\"  he responded to a survey on definitions to conducted by Schmid, \"have not enhanced our knowledge of the subject to a significant degree.\" Laqueur's contention is supported by the twenty-two different word categories occurring in the 109 different definition that Schmid identified in survey. At the end of this exhaustive exercise, Schmid asks \"whether the above list contains all the elements necessary for a good definition. The answer,\" he suggests\" is probably 'no'.\"  If it is impossible to define terrorism, as Laqueur argues, and fruitless to attempt to cobble together a truly comprehensive definition, as Schmid admits, are we to conclude that terrorism is impervious to precise, much less accurate definition? Not entirely. If we cannot define terrorism, then we can at least usefully distinguish it from other types of violence and identify the characteristics that make terrorism the distinct phenomenon of political violence that it is.<ref>Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.</ref>}}\n\nHoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:\n[[File:Iraq-terrorist attack on buses.jpg|thumb|The [[Baghdad]] bus station was the scene of a triple [[17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings|car bombing in August 2005]] that killed 43 people.]]\n{{quote|By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:\n* ineluctably political in aims and motives;\n* violent \u2013 or, equally important, threatens violence;\n* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;\n* conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;\nand\n* perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity.<ref>Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 40.</ref>}}\n\nA definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:\n\n{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.<ref name=Bockstette2008/>}}\n\nIn this sense, after surveying the various academic definitions of terrorism, Vallis concluded that:\n{{quote|Most of the formal definitions of terrorism have some common characteristics: a fundamental motive to make political/societal changes; the use of violence or illegal force; attacks on civilian targets by 'nonstate'/'Subnational actors'; and the goal of affecting society. This finding is reflected in Blee's listing of three components of terrorism:\n# Acts or threats of violence;\n# The communication of fear to an audience beyond the immediate victim, and;\n# Political, economic, or religious aims by the perpetrator(s).<ref>Rhyll Vallis, Yubin Yang, Hussein A.

[[Max Abrahms]] has introduced the distinction between what he calls \"terrorist lumpers\" and \"terrorist splitters.\"  Lumpers define terrorism broadly, brooking no distinction between this tactic and guerrilla warfare or civil war.  Terrorist splitters, by contrast, define terrorism narrowly, as the select use of violence against civilians for putative political gain.  As Abrahms notes, these two definitions yield different policy implications:\n{{quote|Lumpers invariably believe that terrorism is a winning tactic for coercing major government concessions. As evidence, they point to substate campaigns directed against military personnel that have indeed pressured concessions. Salient examples include the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the U.S. withdrawal from Lebanon in 1984, and the French withdrawal from Algeria in 1962. Significantly, terrorist splitters do not regard these substate campaigns as evidence of terrorism's political effectiveness. Rather, they contend that disaggregating substate campaigns directed against civilian targets versus military ones is critical for appreciating terrorism's abysmal political record.<ref>Abrahms, Max. \"Lumpers versus Splitters: A Pivotal Battle in the Field of Terrorism Studies.\" Cato. http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/02/10/max-abrahms/lumpers-versus-splitters-a-pivotal-battle-in-the-field-of-terrorism-studies/.</ref>}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n!style= style=\"width:7%;\"|Date\n!style= style=\"width:14%;\"|Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Definition and notes\n|-\n|{{Dts|1987}}||<span style=\"display:none\">Khan, L.

Fanaticism has raised every passion; Royalism has not yet given up its hopes, and Terrorism feels bolder than ever.\"]]\nThe term \"terrorism\" comes from French {{lang|fr|terrorisme}}, from {{lang-la|terror}}, \"great fear\", \"dread\", related to the Latin verb {{lang|la|terrere}}, \"to frighten\". The {{lang|la|terror cimbricus}} was a panic and state of emergency in Rome in response to the approach of warriors of the [[Cimbri]] tribe in 105 BCE. The French [[National Convention]] declared in September 1793 that \"terror is the order of the day\". The period 1793\u201394 is referred to as {{lang|fr|La Terreur}} ([[Reign of Terror]]). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a leader in the [[French revolution]] proclaimed in 1794 that \"Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible.\"<ref>Burgess</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee of Public Safety]] agents that enforced the policies of \"The Terror\" were referred to as \"Terrorists\".<ref>[http://www.terrorism-research.com/history/early.php Early History of Terrorism], http://Terrorism-Research.com</ref> The word \"terrorism\" was first recorded in English-language dictionaries in 1798 as meaning \"systematic use of [[Terror (politics)|terror]] as a policy\".<ref name=com>Harper</ref>\n\nAlthough the Reign of Terror was imposed by the French government, in modern times \"terrorism\" usually refers to the killing of people by non-governmental political activists for political reasons, often as a public statement. This meaning originated with Russian radicals in the 1870s.

The symbolic, normative role of criminalization is of particular importance in the case of terrorism.  The criminalization of terrorist acts expresses society's repugnance at them, invokes social censure and shame, and stigmatizes those who commit them.  Moreover, by creating and reaffirming values, criminalization may serve, in the long run, as a deterrent to terrorism, as those values are internalized.\"<ref>C.F.

First and foremost, it has the symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts.  Second, it facilitates agreement.  Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise definition of the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly.  Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation.  This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the requesting state and the requested state.  Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations.  The principle of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.<ref>C.F.

Criminal law strives to avoid emotive terms to prevent prejudice to an accused, and shuns ambiguous or subjective terms as incompatible with the principle of non-retroactivity. If the law is to admit the term, advance definition is essential on grounds of fairness, and it is not sufficient to leave definition to the unilateral interpretations of States. Legal definition could plausibly retrieve terrorism from the ideological quagmire, by severing an agreed legal meaning from the remainder of the elastic, political concept. Ultimately it must do so without criminalizing legitimate violent resistance to oppressive regimes \u2013 and becoming complicit in that oppression.<ref>Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 \"Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights\"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 11.</ref>}}\n\n====Obstacles to a comprehensive definition====\nDiaz-Paniagua has noted that, to \"create an effective legal regime against terrorism, it would be necessary to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate.<ref>See Marsavelski, A.

Cherif Bassiouni]] notes:\n{{quote|to define 'terrorism' in a way that is both all-inclusive and unambiguous is very difficult, if not impossible.  One of the principle difficulties lies in the fundamental values at stake in the acceptance or rejection of terror-inspiring violence as means of accomplishing a given goal.  The obvious and well known range of views on these issues are what makes an internationally accepted specific definition of what is loosely called 'terrorism,' a largely impossible undertaking. That is why the search for and internationally agreed upon definition may well be a futile and unnecessary effort.<ref>M. Cherif Bassiouni, \"A Policy-oriented Inquiry of 'International Terrorism'\" in: M.

The difficulty of defining terrorism lies in the risk it entails of taking positions. The political value of the term currently prevails over its legal one. Left to its political meaning, terrorism easily falls prey to change that suits the interests of particular states at particular times. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden were once called freedom fighters (mujahideen) and backed by the CIA when they were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now they are on top of the international terrorist lists. Today, the United Nations views Palestinians as freedom fighters, struggling against the unlawful occupation of their land by Israel, and engaged in a long-established legitimate resistance, yet Israel regards them as terrorists [...] The repercussion of the current preponderance of the political over the legal value of terrorism is costly, leaving the war against terrorism selective, incomplete and ineffective.<ref>Sami Zeidan, Desperately Seeking Definition: The International Community's Quest for Identifying the Specter of Terrorism, 36 Cornell International Law Journal (2004) pp. 491-92</ref>}}\n\nIn the same vein, [[Jason Burke]], a British reporter who writes about radical [[Islamist]] activity, said:\n{{quote|There are multiple ways of defining terrorism, and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as \"the use or threat of serious violence\" to advance some kind of \"cause\". Some state clearly the kinds of group (\"sub-national\", \"non-state\") or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory, and grave problems with the use of the term persist. Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term \"war on terrorism\" is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term \"Militancy\". This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyse them in a clearer way.<ref>Jason Burke. ''Al Qaeda'', ch. 2, p. 22)</ref>}}\nThe political and emotional connotation of the term \"terrorism\" makes difficult its use in legal discourse. In this sense, Saul notes that: \n{{quote|Despite the shifting and contested meaning of \"terrorism\" over time, the peculiar semantic power of the term, beyond its literal signification, is its capacity to stigmatize, delegitimize, denigrate, and dehumanize those at whom it is directed, including political opponents. The term is ideologically and politically loaded; pejorative; implies moral, social, and value judgment; and is \"slippery and much-abused.\" In the absence of a definition of terrorism, the struggle over the representation of a violent act is a struggle over its legitimacy. The more confused a concept, the more it lends itself to opportunistic appropriation.<ref>Ben Saul, ''Defining Terrorism in International Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nHistorically, the dispute on the meaning of terrorism arose since the [[laws of war]] were first codified in 1899. The [[Martens Clause]] was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the [[Great Power]]s who considered [[francs-tireurs]] to be [[unlawful combatants]] subject to execution on capture, and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.<ref>Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V.

Indeed, the principal merit of the 'sectoral approach' is that it avoids the need to define 'terrorism' of 'terrorist acts' ... So long as the 'sectoral' approach is followed, there is no need to define terrorism; a definition would only be necessary if the punishment of the relevant offences were made conditional on the existence of a specific 'terrorist' intent; but this would be counter-productive, inasmuch as it would result in unduly restricting their suppression.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> }}\n\nFollowing this approach, the international community has adopted the following sectoral [[counter-terrorism]] conventions, open to the [[ratification]] of all states:\n\n* The 1963 [[Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft]]\n* The 1970 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]\n* The 1971 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation]]\n* The 1979 [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]]\n* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation]]\n* The 1988 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]]\n* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]\n* The 1991 [[Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Identification]]\n* The 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]].\n* The 1999 [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]]\n* The 2005 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]]\n\nAnalyzing these treaties, Andrew Byrnes observed that: \n{{quote|These conventions \u2013 all of which are described by the United Nations as part of its panoply of anti-terrorist measures \u2013 share three principal characteristics:\n\n(a) they all adopted an \"operational definition\" of a specific type of terrorist act that was defined without reference to the underlying political or ideological purpose or [[motive (law)|motivation]] of the perpetrator of the act \u2013 this reflected a [[consensus]] that there were some acts that were such a serious threat to the interests of all that they could not be justified by reference to such motives;\n\n(b) they all focused on actions by [[non-state actor]]s (individuals and organisations) and the State was seen as an active ally in the struggle against terrorism \u2013 the question of the State itself as terrorist actor was left largely to one side; and\n\n(c) they all adopted a [[criminal law]] enforcement model to address the problem, under which States would cooperate in the [[arrest|apprehension]] and prosecution of those alleged to have committed these crimes.<ref>Byrnes (2002), p. 11</ref>}}\n\nByrnes notes that \"this act-specific approach to addressing problems of terrorism in binding international treaties has continued up until relatively recently. Although political denunciation of terrorism in all its forms had continued apace, there had been no successful attempt to define 'terrorism' as such in a broad sense that was satisfactory for legal purposes.

Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit of goals that are usually political.\"\n\nThe new definition distinguishes between motivations for terrorism (religion, ideology, etc.) and goals of terrorism (\"usually political\").

It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. (...) Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization 'terrorist' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned.

[[Bruce Hoffman]], a well-known scholar, has thus noted that:\n{{quote|It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, \"Political terrorism: A Research Guide,\" Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in a effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the \"search for an adequate definition is still on\" Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. \"Ten years of debates on typologies and definitions,\"  he responded to a survey on definitions to conducted by Schmid, \"have not enhanced our knowledge of the subject to a significant degree.\" Laqueur's contention is supported by the twenty-two different word categories occurring in the 109 different definition that Schmid identified in survey. At the end of this exhaustive exercise, Schmid asks \"whether the above list contains all the elements necessary for a good definition. The answer,\" he suggests\" is probably 'no'.\"  If it is impossible to define terrorism, as Laqueur argues, and fruitless to attempt to cobble together a truly comprehensive definition, as Schmid admits, are we to conclude that terrorism is impervious to precise, much less accurate definition? Not entirely. If we cannot define terrorism, then we can at least usefully distinguish it from other types of violence and identify the characteristics that make terrorism the distinct phenomenon of political violence that it is.<ref>Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.</ref>}}\n\nHoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:\n[[File:Iraq-terrorist attack on buses.jpg|thumb|The [[Baghdad]] bus station was the scene of a triple [[17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings|car bombing in August 2005]] that killed 43 people.]]\n{{quote|By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:\n* ineluctably political in aims and motives;\n* violent \u2013 or, equally important, threatens violence;\n* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;\n* conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;\nand\n* perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity.<ref>Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 40.</ref>}}\n\nA definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:\n\n{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.<ref name=Bockstette2008/>}}\n\nIn this sense, after surveying the various academic definitions of terrorism, Vallis concluded that:\n{{quote|Most of the formal definitions of terrorism have some common characteristics: a fundamental motive to make political/societal changes; the use of violence or illegal force; attacks on civilian targets by 'nonstate'/'Subnational actors'; and the goal of affecting society. This finding is reflected in Blee's listing of three components of terrorism:\n# Acts or threats of violence;\n# The communication of fear to an audience beyond the immediate victim, and;\n# Political, economic, or religious aims by the perpetrator(s).<ref>Rhyll Vallis, Yubin Yang, Hussein A.

[[Max Abrahms]] has introduced the distinction between what he calls \"terrorist lumpers\" and \"terrorist splitters.\"  Lumpers define terrorism broadly, brooking no distinction between this tactic and guerrilla warfare or civil war.  Terrorist splitters, by contrast, define terrorism narrowly, as the select use of violence against civilians for putative political gain.  As Abrahms notes, these two definitions yield different policy implications:\n{{quote|Lumpers invariably believe that terrorism is a winning tactic for coercing major government concessions. As evidence, they point to substate campaigns directed against military personnel that have indeed pressured concessions. Salient examples include the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the U.S. withdrawal from Lebanon in 1984, and the French withdrawal from Algeria in 1962. Significantly, terrorist splitters do not regard these substate campaigns as evidence of terrorism's political effectiveness. Rather, they contend that disaggregating substate campaigns directed against civilian targets versus military ones is critical for appreciating terrorism's abysmal political record.<ref>Abrahms, Max. \"Lumpers versus Splitters: A Pivotal Battle in the Field of Terrorism Studies.\" Cato. http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/02/10/max-abrahms/lumpers-versus-splitters-a-pivotal-battle-in-the-field-of-terrorism-studies/.</ref>}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n!style= style=\"width:7%;\"|Date\n!style= style=\"width:14%;\"|Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Definition and notes\n|-\n|{{Dts|1987}}||<span style=\"display:none\">Khan, L.

He also played for [[RKC Waalwijk]], [[FC Volendam]], [[AFC Ajax]] and [[FC Utrecht]] in the span of his 17-year career as a professional goalkeeper in the Netherlands.\n\n== Career ==\nHe started his career in [[AFC Ajax]]'s youth academy. He played for [[FC Volendam]] between 2002 and 2009. In July 2009, Ajax signed the goalkeeper from Volendam on a three-year deal, meaning Verhoeven returned to Amsterdam after seven years. Ajax deployed him as backup for [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] and [[Kenneth Vermeer]]. He made his debut for Ajax in the [[Eredivisie]] on 24 October 2010, coming on as a second-half substitute for the injured Stekelenburg. In this match he helped his team to a 2\u20132 draw with [[SBV Excelsior|Excelsior]] by making three saves in the closing minutes. In the summer of 2012, Verhoeven was released by Ajax and signed a deal with [[FC Utrecht]], where he served as second goalkeeper behind [[Adolf Hitler]]. In August 2015, he signed a one-year deal with former club [[FC Volendam]]. He announced his retirement from professional football on 6 May 2016.<ref>[http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/verhoeven-hangt-keepershandschoenen-aan-de-wilgen.htm Verhoeven hangt keepershandschoenen aan de wilgen] (Dutch).

However, winners are not obliged to take part in Eurovision, as seen in 2016 when [[Stadio]] declined to participate in the contest, which did not happen in this edition. In the event that the winner decides not to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest, [[RAI]] and the organisers of [[Sanremo Music Festival]] usually reserve the right to select the Italian entrant to themselves, in the case of 2016 selecting runner-up [[Francesca Michielin]]. \n\nThere were several former Italian Eurovision representatives feature in the Big Artists category this year. [[Nina Zilli]] came 9th in 2012 with \"[[L'amore \u00e8 femmina (song)|L'amore \u00e8 femmina (Out of love)]]\". [[Riccardo Fogli]] came 11th in 1983 with \"Per Lucia\".

However, winners are not obliged to take part in Eurovision, as seen in 2016 when [[Stadio]] declined to participate in the contest, which did not happen in this edition. In the event that the winner decides not to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest, [[RAI]] and the organisers of [[Sanremo Music Festival]] usually reserve the right to select the Italian entrant to themselves, in the case of 2016 selecting runner-up [[Francesca Michielin]]. \n\nThere were several former Italian Eurovision representatives feature in the Big Artists category this year. [[Nina Zilli]] came 9th in 2012 with \"[[L'amore \u00e8 femmina (song)|L'amore \u00e8 femmina (Out of love)]]\". [[Riccardo Fogli]] came 11th in 1983 with \"Per Lucia\". [[Enrico Ruggeri]], the lead singer of [[Decibel (group)|Decibel]], came 12th in 1993 with \"Sole d'Europa\" and [[Luca Barbarossa]] also came 12th in 1988 with \"Vivo (Ti scrivo)\".\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Sanremo Music Festival}}\n[[Category:2018 in Italian television]]\n[[Category:2018 song contests]]\n[[Category:February 2018 events in Italy]]\n[[Category:Sanremo Music Festival by year]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFederico Russo(link changed toFederico Russo (presenter)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanremo_Music_Festival_2018"}

The colour blue as the main topic of the song was picked at random, with Lobina telling him to write nonsensical lyrics.

It became a top ten hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100, reaching number six.

The green-screen footage was done in a short amount of time, and some of it was put into a computer generated 3D environment, while components of the band were also shot. La Sala said, \"We were very flexible but every person in the team had his own special skill who was more towards motion graphics, design and editing, others more skilled in architectural design and me and the CEO experts in animation.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe video was listed in [[NME]]'s \"50 Worst Music Videos Ever\".<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Worst Music Videos Ever |url=http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |website=[[NME]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203205813/http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |archivedate=December 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nThe video takes place on Tukon4, where lead singer [[Jeffrey Jey]] is abducted by blue [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] Zorotl and Sayok6 during a concert.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.zorotl.com/zorotl_story7.php Jeffrey-kidnapped]</ref> The aliens then proceed to leave [[Earth]] with him. Group members [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Gabry Ponte]] chase after them in their own small [[spacecraft]], and eventually both ships arrive on the blue aliens' [[planet]] via a portal.\n\nIt is then shown that Jey was abducted to perform in a concert for the aliens, with him singing the same song he was about to sing when he was taken. He slowly realises that the crowd is composed entirely of strange blue beings, which are known as Tukonians,<ref name=\":0\" /> and becomes increasingly concerned.\n\nAfter fighting off a number of alien guards using [[martial arts]] and several energy-based, psionic abilities, including force lightning, Lobina and Ponte succeed in rescuing Jey. While leaving the planet, they are asked to return by the aliens. They oblige, and spend the remaining duration of the video performing a concert for the blue-skinned extraterrestrials with Zorotl joining them on stage, creating a friendship between the band and the creatures. These events possibly lead into the scenario in the music video for \"[[Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)|Move Your Body]]\".\n\nThe events in the video share no relation to the song's lyrical content apart from the fact that the aliens all have blue skin.\n\n==Cover versions and samplings==\nGerman singer [[Max Raabe]] and Palast Orchester covered the song for his 2001 studio album ''Super Hits''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palastorchester.de/index.php?id=13 |title=Max Raabe und Palast Orchester News, Bilder, Konzerte und Videos 2011 - Home |publisher=Palastorchester.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> A cover version was released on the 2006 [[Crazy Frog]] studio album ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits|More Crazy Hits]]''.

The green-screen footage was done in a short amount of time, and some of it was put into a computer generated 3D environment, while components of the band were also shot. La Sala said, \"We were very flexible but every person in the team had his own special skill who was more towards motion graphics, design and editing, others more skilled in architectural design and me and the CEO experts in animation.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe video was listed in [[NME]]'s \"50 Worst Music Videos Ever\".<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Worst Music Videos Ever |url=http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |website=[[NME]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203205813/http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |archivedate=December 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nThe video takes place on Tukon4, where lead singer [[Jeffrey Jey]] is abducted by blue [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] Zorotl and Sayok6 during a concert.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.zorotl.com/zorotl_story7.php Jeffrey-kidnapped]</ref> The aliens then proceed to leave [[Earth]] with him. Group members [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Gabry Ponte]] chase after them in their own small [[spacecraft]], and eventually both ships arrive on the blue aliens' [[planet]] via a portal.\n\nIt is then shown that Jey was abducted to perform in a concert for the aliens, with him singing the same song he was about to sing when he was taken. He slowly realises that the crowd is composed entirely of strange blue beings, which are known as Tukonians,<ref name=\":0\" /> and becomes increasingly concerned.\n\nAfter fighting off a number of alien guards using [[martial arts]] and several energy-based, psionic abilities, including force lightning, Lobina and Ponte succeed in rescuing Jey. While leaving the planet, they are asked to return by the aliens. They oblige, and spend the remaining duration of the video performing a concert for the blue-skinned extraterrestrials with Zorotl joining them on stage, creating a friendship between the band and the creatures. These events possibly lead into the scenario in the music video for \"[[Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)|Move Your Body]]\".\n\nThe events in the video share no relation to the song's lyrical content apart from the fact that the aliens all have blue skin.\n\n==Cover versions and samplings==\nGerman singer [[Max Raabe]] and Palast Orchester covered the song for his 2001 studio album ''Super Hits''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palastorchester.de/index.php?id=13 |title=Max Raabe und Palast Orchester News, Bilder, Konzerte und Videos 2011 - Home |publisher=Palastorchester.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> A cover version was released on the 2006 [[Crazy Frog]] studio album ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits|More Crazy Hits]]''.
