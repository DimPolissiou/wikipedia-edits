He was a major [[Calvinist]] opponent of [[John Wesley]].  He is best remembered as the author of the hymn [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|\"Rock of Ages\"]].  Three of his other hymns \u2013 \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\", \"Deathless Principle, Arise\" and \"Object of My First Desire\" \u2013 are still occasionally sung today.\n\n==Background and early life, 1740\u201355==\nAugustus Toplady was born in [[Farnham]], Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in ''A Short Essay on Original Sin'', and in a public debate delivered a speech on ''Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?''. In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G.

Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the [[five points of Calvinism]].\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled \"The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted\", adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.  He is too dirty a writer for me to meddle with. I should only foul my fingers. I read his title-page, and troubled myself no farther. I leave him to Mr Sellon.

At least up to that point it appears that Toplady received no response.-->\n\n==Last years==\n\nToplady spent his last three years mainly in London, preaching regularly in a [[Huguenot|French Calvinist]] chapel at Orange Street (off of Haymarket), most spectacularly in 1778, when he appeared to rebut charges being made by Wesley's followers that he had renounced Calvinism on his deathbed.\n\nToplady died of [[tuberculosis]] on 11 August 1778.

Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.  He is too dirty a writer for me to meddle with. I should only foul my fingers. I read his title-page, and troubled myself no farther. I leave him to Mr Sellon. He cannot be in better hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bayliss |first1=Peter |title=Rock of Ages |url=http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/rockofages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021002200/http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/rockofages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 October 2004 |publisher=This England Magazine |accessdate=3 July 2016 }}</ref><!--But compare the letter to Wesley from 1771.

Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as ''fast'' bowlers, ''quicks'', or ''pacemen''. They can also be referred to as a ''seam'' bowler, a ''swing'' bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries. Strictly speaking, a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace, though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days.\n\nThe aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake. The bowler achieves this by making the hard [[cricket ball]] deviate from a predictable, linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it. For deviation caused by the ball's stitching (the seam), the ball bounces off the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] and deflects either away from the batsman's body, or inwards towards them. Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way. To 'bowl swing' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air. Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation, body position at the point of release, asymmetric ball polishing, and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball. The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement' can make it difficult for the [[batsman]] to address the flight of the ball accurately. Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory, the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly, or at all. A typical fast delivery by a professional has a speed in the range of {{convert|85|-|95|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n[[File:Graham Onions bowling, 2012.ogv|thumb|300px|Fast bowler [[Graham Onions]] bowling for [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in the [[2012 Friends Life t20]]]]\n[[File:John blain yuvraj singh odi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Scotland's fast bowler [[John Blain (cricketer)|John Blain]] hits the wicket of India's [[Yuvraj Singh]], 2007]]\n\n== Categorisation ==\nIt is possible for a bowler to concentrate solely on speed, especially when young, but as fast bowlers mature they may develop the skills of [[swing bowling]] or [[seam bowling]] techniques, both of which aim to move the ball laterally. Many fast bowlers specialise in one of these two areas and are sometimes categorised as a swing or seam bowler. However, this classification is not satisfactory because the categories are not mutually exclusive{{fact|date=September 2019}} and a skilled bowler usually bowls a mixture of fast, swinging, seaming, and also [[Off cutter|cutting]] balls\u2014even if they prefer one style to the others.{{cn|date=September 2019}} For simplicity, it is common to subdivide fast bowlers according to the average speed of their deliveries, as follows.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Classification of fast bowlers<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.cricvision.com/fast-bowling-classification-speed/ |title= Fast Bowling: Classification by Speed |publisher= Cricvision |date= 30 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n!

For comparison, most spin bowlers in professional cricket bowl at average speeds of 70 to 90&nbsp;km/h (45 to 55&nbsp;mph).  [[Shoaib Akhtar]], [[Brett Lee]], [[Shaun Tait]], [[Jeff Thomson]] (in an exhibition match) and [[Mitchell Starc]] have clocked over 160&nbsp;km/h and are categorised as \u2018Ultra Fast\u2019 bowlers although often bowling at speeds significantly lower than this mark. Also, while [[Steven Finn (cricketer)|Steven Finn]] is classified as a fast-medium bowler by Cricinfo, he can consistently bowl at around 145&nbsp;km/h, with his fastest clocked at 151.9&nbsp;km/h, making him the 10th fastest amongst active bowlers as of 3 January 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1H5UvS34wc|title=TOP 10 Fastest Bowlers in Current Cricket|first=|last=Cricket Bits|date=3 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== Technique ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket Grip fast.png|thumb|Fast-bowling grip]]\n\n=== Grip ===\nThe first thing a fast bowler needs to do is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close together at the top of the seam with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of the seam. The image on the top shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls \u2013 see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.\n\n=== Run-up ===\n[[File:Bowling action.png|thumb|upright=3|centre|Typical action of a fast bowler, starting with ''Run-up'' at the extreme left]]\nA fast bowler needs to take a longer run-up toward the wicket than a spinner, due to the need to generate the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery. Fast bowlers measure their preferred run up in strides, and mark the distance from the wicket. It is important for the bowler to know exactly how long the run-up is because it must terminate behind the [[popping crease]]. A bowler who steps beyond this has bowled a [[no-ball]], which affords the batsman immunity from dismissal, adds one run to the batting team's score, and forces the bowler to bowl another ball in the over.\n\n=== Action ===\n[[File:Brett Lee Bowling.jpg|thumb|right|Brett Lee bowling against South Africa at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]] in 2005]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAt the end of the run-up the bowler brings his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as straight as possible. This helps generate speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure it places on the joint. Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the [[England cricket team|English]] pace bowler [[David Lawrence (cricketer)|David Lawrence]] was sidelined for many months after splitting his [[kneecap]] in two. The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe. The bowler then brings the bowling arm up over their head and releases the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch. Again, the arm must be straight though this is a stipulation of the [[laws of cricket]] rather than an aid to speed. Bending the elbow and \"chucking\" the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.\n[[File:Mitchell Johnson.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] bowling. Note the \"sling shot\" action.]]\nFast bowlers tend to have an action that leaves them either side-on or chest-on at the end of the run up. A chest-on bowler has chest and hips aligned towards the batsman at the instant of [[back foot contact]], while a side-on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of back foot contact. West Indian bowler [[Malcolm Marshall]] was a classic example of a chest-on bowler, while Australian pace bowler [[Dennis Lillee]] used a side-on technique to great effect.\n\nWhile a bowler's action does not affect their bowling speed, it can limit the style of balls that they can bowl. Although this is not a hard and fast rule, side-on bowlers generally bowl [[outswinger]]s, and chest-on bowlers generally bowl [[inswinger]]s.\n\nA variant on the fast bowler's action is the sling (sometimes referred to as the slingshot or javelin), where the bowler begins his delivery with his or her arm fully extended behind their back. The slinging action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control. The most famous exponent of the slinging action was [[Jeff Thomson]], who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up. Other international examples include [[Fidel Edwards]], [[Shaun Tait]], [[Lasith Malinga]], [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]], [[Shoaib Akhtar]] and [[Jasprit Bumrah]].\n\n=== Follow through ===\n[[File:Matthew Hoggard bowl.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Matthew Hoggard]] begins his follow-through in training.]]\nAfter the ball has been released, the bowler \"follows through\" at the end of his or her action. This involves veering to the side so as not to tread on the pitch and taking a few more strides to slow down. Striding on to the protected area of the pitch at the end of a delivery can damage the surface, making rough patches that [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]] can exploit to get extra turn on the ball; doing so is illegal according to the laws of the game. Bowlers who persistently run onto the pitch can be warned, with three warnings disqualifying a bowler from bowling again during the [[innings]].\n\n== Line and length ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAn effective fast bowler must be able to hold a consistent [[line and length]], or in common terms, to be accurate. In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler [[Glenn McGrath]] and South African pace bowler [[Shaun Pollock]].\n\n=== Line ===\n\nIn modern cricket, the two lines usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the so-called ''[[corridor of uncertainty]]'', the area just outside the batsman's [[stump (cricket)|off stump]], or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as [[off theory]] (contrast [[leg theory]]), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.\n\nPrecise mastery of the line of the ball is best used when a batsman is known to have a weakness hitting a particular shot, because a bowler with an effective line can place the ball in the weak spot time after time. Failing to overcome a persistent inability to hit balls on a certain line has been enough to end the careers of innumerable batsmen once they had been found out by skilled line bowlers.\n\n=== Length ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket delivery lengths en.svg|frame|right|Lengths of balls showing name & bounce height (arriving at the batsman). Angles are exaggerated.]]\nA [[good length ball]] is one that makes the batsman unsure whether he should play forward or back to the delivery. There is no fixed distance to a good length, or indeed any other length of ball in cricket since the distance required varies with ball speed, the state of the pitch, and heights of the bowler and batsman. Note that bowling a \"good length\" in this sense is not always appropriate\u2014in some situations, on some pitches and against some batsmen other lengths are more effective. The diagram to the right explains the different lengths.\n\nA ball that bounces a little way before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen is said to be ''short pitched'' or described as a ''long hop'' and is easier for a batsman to hit as he has had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing.{{Dubious|date=September 2015}} A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking [[pull shot]]. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] and can be an effective delivery. Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called [[wide (cricket)|wide]] by the [[umpire (cricket)|Umpire]]. Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, balls that bounce slightly closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be ''full pitched'' or ''overpitched'' or described as a ''half volley''. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the [[yorker]]. An effective yorker's length is difficult to pick early, forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well-bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a ''[[full toss]]''. It is easier for a batsman to play such a delivery as it has not deviated from bouncing off the pitch.\n\nBecause the three effective lengths (good length, bouncer and yorker) are all interspersed by lengths that are easier for the batsman to hit, control of length is an important discipline for a fast bowler. In addition to all the above variables, batsmen control how far out of the crease they face, further complicating the bowler's task of correct length estimation. [[Spin bowling|Spin bowlers]] on the other hand are almost always aiming for the good length, but need a much finer control of flight and line to be effective.\nA fast bowler tries to be physically fit throughout his cricket career, which may span more than a decade.\n\n== Strike bowling ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nStrike bowling is the term usually applied to bowlers that are used mainly to get a batsman out at the possible expense of runs if the wicket-taking is unsuccessful. For fast bowlers, this can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, rather than trying to make the ball move through the air or off the pitch. More commonly however, aggressive bowling techniques can be combined with [[swing bowling]] and [[seam bowling]] techniques to create nigh-on unplayable balls in the hands of a bowler of any speed. The inswinging [[yorker]] is seen as particularly deadly.\n\n=== Bouncer ===\n{{main|Bouncer (cricket)}}\n\nA bouncer (or bumper) is a ball aimed to pitch in the first half of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or head height by the time it reaches the batsman. This causes two problems for the batsman who receives the ball. If they try to play it, their bat is at eye-level making it difficult to visually track the ball to the bat and time the shot correctly. If they leave or miss the ball, it may strike them painfully on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury. For this reason, bowling spells containing many bouncers are said to be ''intimidatory bowling''.\n\nThe usual response to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible, as the likely result is that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy [[catch (cricket)|catch]]. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.\n\nPhysically powerful batsmen often attempt to strike the ball on the rise, even though this obstructs their vision of the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of the ball makes it fly to the boundary. This possibility, combined with the difficulty that the [[wicketkeeper]] has trying to stop a high ball, means that bouncers can be expensive in terms of runs against skilled batsmen.\n\n=== Slower ball ===\n{{main|Slower ball}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket Grip slower.png|thumb|Slower ball grip]]\n\nA slower ball is a ball delivered exactly like a usual pace delivery in terms of action and run-up but where the grip is changed slightly to slow the ball down. This deceives the batsman, who will likely try to play the ball as though it were at full speed, making them mistime the shot. The result is usually that the ball strikes lower down the bat, making it leave the bat at a slower speed. (A cricket bat has a ''middle'' \u2013 hitting the ball at this point transfers the maximum possible energy to the ball. Hitting the ball away from the ''middle'' transfers less energy, producing less speed.) Also, the bat generally has travelled further when it hits the ball, and is in the upward part of its arc, so it leaves the bat at a steeper angle. The combination of these can be a slow-moving, looping ball that  is relatively easy to catch. In an extreme case, the batsman plays the shot so early as to completely play over the ball, and be [[Bowled|clean-bowled]].\n\nOne of a number of different grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially the only difference is that the middle and index fingers are split and come down on each side of the seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by [[off spin]]ners. A slower delivery may also be achieved \u2013 less commonly \u2013 by using a [[leg spin]] grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.\n\nThe slower ball is particularly effective against a batsman seeking to score quickly. Consequently, its prominence has increased with the development of [[one-day cricket]] and [[Twenty20 cricket]], and particularly when \"[[Glossary of cricket terms#Death overs|bowling at the death]]\" (at the end of an innings) where batsman attack with abandon.\n\nA more experienced batsman can adjust a shot mid-stroke, momentarily pausing so as to ''middle'' the ball when it is hit.\n\nIn another version of the slower ball, also known as the SLOB, the bowler releases the ball with the top fingers only. Aimed as a \"beamer\", the delivery method makes the ball drop dramatically in flight and arrive at a ''yorker'' length. This was most famously used by [[Chris Cairns]] to [[Chris Read]], causing him to duck into a full length ball that [[bowled|went on to the stumps]].\n\n=== Yorker ===\n{{main|Yorker}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nA yorker ball bounces off the pitch right in front of (or is aimed at the toes of) the batsman's feet, an area known as the ''block hole''. Because of the usual stance of the batsman and the regulation length of the [[cricket bat]] the bat is not usually held near the ground while the batsman prepares to strike the ball, so playing a yorker requires the batsman to alter the height of his or her bat very quickly after detecting a yorker has been bowled. This is difficult, and the yorker can often squeeze through the gap and break the wicket. Successfully playing this type of delivery is also known as ''digging out'' a yorker.\n\nBowling a yorker requires pinpoint accuracy, since bowling it slightly too long results in a [[full toss]] or full pitched delivery that is easy for the batsman to play because the ball has not deviated by bouncing off the pitch. It also has most of its value as a surprise ball. For these two reasons, yorkers are not common deliveries in most circumstances.\n\nIn the latter stages of an innings in [[one day cricket]], batters seek to attack every ball bowled.  In such circumstances, the yorker is a particularly effective delivery, both in taking wickets and preventing boundaries from being hit.  Therefore, the yorker is very frequently bowled in these circumstances, and bowlers who can bowl yorkers accurately are prized in this form of cricket.\n\n== Seam bowling ==\n{{main|Seam bowling}}\n[[File:Andrew Flintoff bowl.jpg|90px|left|thumb|[[Andrew Flintoff]] of England bowls in the nets, watched by [[Kevin Shine]]. Note the upright seam]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nSeam bowling is the act of using the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an unpredictable fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman can predict where a ball is going to bounce, and from that work out what the height of the ball will be when it reaches the bat. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely that the batsman will make a mistake in this assessment give away their wicket.\n\nSeam deliveries can be bowled at any pace, but most specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace. The basic technique of seam bowling is to employ the normal fast bowling or slower ball grip and to try to ensure that the seam remains upright until the ball hits the pitch. If the seam is upright and the ball is spinning around its horizontal axis, there is no appreciable [[Magnus effect]], and the ball does not move in the air. The seam of the ball is raised and causes variations in bounce and movement if it is the first part of the ball to hit the pitch.\n\nSeam bowlers can get a lot of help from certain types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the hardness makes it easier to bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as ''variable bounce''. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. [[Cricket pitch|Green pitches]] can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a ''flat track'' in cricket [[vernacular]]) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.\n\n=== Cutters ===\n{{main|Leg cutter|Off cutter}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket Grip legcutter.png|thumb|Leg-cutter grip]]\n[[File:Cricket Grip offcutter.png|thumb|Off-cutter grip]]\n\nA cutter is a fast ball that is spinning, that is, a delivery that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead of keeping the seam straight. While this rotation is nowhere near as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still enough to make a batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball. Cutters can be an effective way for a seam bowler to get the ball to move if he or she is not receiving much assistance from the pitch.\n\nA ball rotating around the seam moves either right or left when it hits the pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right is said to be an off cutter as it is travelling from [[Stump (cricket)|off stump]] to [[leg stump]] for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This makes the ball catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle, and fly up to be caught in the [[Fielding positions in cricket|slips]].\n\nTo bowl a cutter, the bowler uses a different grip. The two grips are shown to the right, with the uppermost one producing a [[leg cutter]] while the lower one shows the grip required for an [[off cutter]]. As well as changing the grip, the bowler must pull his or her fingers down the appropriate side of the ball as it leaves their hand to impart the required spin. The action of bowling a cutter also increases drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, causing the ball to slow in the same way as a slower ball and this can also help to confuse the batsman.\n\n== Swing bowling ==\n{{main|Swing bowling}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nSwing bowlers cause the ball to move laterally through the air, rather than off the pitch like seam bowlers. Normal or conventional swing bowling is encouraged by the raised seam of the ball,<ref name=\"Science\">{{Cite web|title = The science of swing bowling|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/258645.html|accessdate = 16 July 2015}}</ref> and conventional swing is usually greatest when the ball is new and therefore has a pronounced seam. As the ball gets older, the wear makes swing more difficult to achieve, but this can be countered if the fielding team systematically polishes one side of the ball while allowing the other to become rough. When the ball has been polished highly on one side and not on the other and if the ball is bowled very fast (over 85 miles per hour), it produces a [[reverse swing]] such that the ball swings in the opposite direction as in conventional swing. Contrary to popular opinion, this [[reverse swing|swing]] is not produced by air flowing faster over the smooth or \"shiny\" side as compared to the rough side.\n\nSwing is produced due to a net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[boundary layer]]. For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction it points governs the direction of swing. Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on the side that the seam is angled toward. This causes the boundary layer to separate from the surface of the ball later (farther toward the rear of the ball) than the other side where it separates earlier (farther forward on the surface). The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam. Conventional swing bowling is delivered with the seam angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of the seam ''i.e.'' toward the rough side.\n\nA swinging ball is classed as either an outswinger, which moves away from the batsman, or an inswinger, which moves in toward the batsman.<ref name=\"Science\"/> In most cases the outswinger is seen as the more dangerous ball because, if the batsman fails to recognise it, it catches the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the [[Fielding positions in cricket|slips]]. Inswingers have their place too, especially combined with the [[yorker]] as this can result in the ball either breaking the wicket (by going clean \"through the gate\" or getting an inside edge) or hitting the pad rather than the bat (resulting in a possible [[leg before wicket|LBW]] decision).\n\nSwing bowling can also be roughly categorised as early swing or late swing, corresponding to when in the trajectory the ball changes direction. The later the ball swings, the less chance the batter has of adjusting to account for the swing.\n\nBowlers usually use the same grip and technique on swing balls as fast balls, though they usually keep the seam slightly rather than straight, and may use the slower ball grip. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball spins in flight, varying the orientation of the shiny and rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in [[Test cricket]] swings more than the white ball used in the [[One Day International|one-day game]].\n\n=== Reverse swing ===\n[[Reverse swing]] is a phenomenon that makes the ball swing in the opposite direction to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball.<ref name=\"Science\" /> When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball swings towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman has in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90&nbsp;mph a ball always exhibits reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases.<ref name=\"Science\" /> This means that an older ball is more likely to be delivered with reverse swing as its surface is roughened through use.\n\nIn [[reverse swing|reverse]] swing the seam is angled in the same way as in conventional swing (10\u201320 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by [[dimples]] in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back \u2013 this enables the golf ball to travel farther.\n\nThe discovery of reverse swing is credited to Pakistan's cricketers, with [[Sarfraz Nawaz]] and [[Farrakh Khan]] both named as originators of the delivery.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/10963855/How-Pakistan-became-the-kings-of-swing.html|title = How Pakistan became the kings of swing|last = Oborne|first = Peter|date = 12 July 2014|work = The Telegraph|access-date = 16 July 2015|via = }}</ref>\n\nNow, in [[one-day cricket]] the mandatory two new balls rule (which states that two new balls must be used at the start of each innings; one from each end) means that the chances of reverse swing are reduced drastically. With two new balls being used, the amount of wear that each ball is subject to is half as compared to usual.\n\n=== Dippers ===\n{{see also|Inswinger|Outswinger}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nA dipper is a swinging ball deliberately bowled as a yorker or a [[full toss]], the latter not normally being a ball that a fast bowler would choose to bowl. The indipper moves in to the right-handed batsman while the outdipper moves away.\n\nTo be effective, a dipper has to generate a lot of swing to make up for the variation in movement lost because the ball is not bouncing on the pitch. However, because the batsman usually expects a full toss to be an easy ball to score off, dippers have huge surprise value and can be extremely difficult to play especially if the bowler is very accurate and manages the yorker rather than a genuine full toss. [[Chaminda Vaas]]' bowling to [[Yuvraj Singh]] in the [[2007\u201308 Commonwealth Bank Series]] is a classic example.\n\n== Intimidatory bowling ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIntimidatory or aggressive bowling is a legitimate tactic of bowling with the intent of hitting the batsman with the ball. This is somewhat restrained by some of the laws of cricket, including those that disallow excessive use of bouncers and any use of the ''beamer'', which is aimed directly at the head on the full. Successful intimidatory bowling usually employs a mixture of bouncers and short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman's head, chest, and rib cage. The intention is to disrupt a batsman's focus, and ultimately induce a mistake that leads to the loss of the batsman's wicket. Often the eventual wicket doesn't fall to a bouncer or short-pitched ball, but instead to a more standard delivery that the batsman is no longer expecting, or is rendered temporarily unable to play in his usual way (by fear, pain, surprise, or some combination of the three).\n\nOne classic approach is to deliver several short balls into the batsman's chest, forcing the batsman onto the back foot to defend with a high bat, and then fire in a fast yorker, aimed at the base of the stumps. If the batsman is expecting to play a high back foot defensive, the time it takes to shift their weight to play the ball at their feet may just be enough for the delivery to surprise the batsman and cause him or her to panic, and thus cause the loss of their wicket.\n\nA fast bowler can also employ intimidatory tactics to anger (or frustrate) a batsman into playing a rash shot, by directing the ball to strike the batsman. Intimidatory bowling plays a part in every fast bowler's attack to some degree, and even the best batsmen sometimes sustain serious injuries that can force them off the field and out of the game. In almost all instances verbal '[[Sledging (cricket)|sledging]]' accompanies the attack.\n\nExcessive use of intimidatory tactics by elite fast bowlers is considered [[unsportsmanlike conduct|unsportsmanlike]], and is shunned by many teams and players. One instance of excessive use was the [[Bodyline]] series, where the [[English Cricket Captain]] at the time (1932\u20131933), [[Douglas Jardine]], employed a tactic to restrain the skills of the [[Australian cricket team]], and their star player, [[Donald Bradman]]. The tactic was to bowl, very fast and very short, at the batsman's body. After the [[Bodyline series]], as it became known, several laws of cricket were altered to prevent such a tactic being used again, such as a restriction on the number of fielders that can occupy the rear leg-side quadrant of the cricket to two (excluding the wicketkeeper).\n\n== Tactics ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nBecause nearly all cricket teams contain several fast bowlers of differing speeds and styles, the tactics of fast bowling depends not only on changing the [[Fielding positions in cricket|field placements]] but on changing the bowler and the types and sequences of deliveries bowled as well. The precise tactics are determined by many factors including the state of the game, the state of the pitch, the weather and the relative energy and skill levels of the various players available to bowl.\n\nFast bowling requires a great deal of energy and most fast bowlers can be expected to bowl a spell of 4\u20136 overs in a row before requiring a rest. Depending on conditions, they may be required by the team to bowl a longer spell although this usually results in drop in effectiveness toward the end of the spell as the bowler tires. Choosing which balls to bowl as part of a spell and what order to bowl them in is a tactical discipline all of its own.\n\n=== Deployment of bowlers ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMost sides contain a mixture of fast bowlers who specialise in aggressive or seam techniques and those who specialise in swing. When the ball is new it usually swings very little, but generates a lot of speed, bounce and variation off the seam (because the seam on a new ball stands out more than that on an old ball). So, seam bowlers are usually chosen to bowl with the new ball either at the start of an innings or when a new ball has been taken, an option the fielding side has once a ball is 80 overs old. In contrast, swing bowlers are more effective once the ball has started to wear and reverse swing requires a well worn ball. Reverse swing bowlers can continue to extract large amounts of movement from balls well over 80 overs old.Then again according to conditions the new ball can swing too.\n\nTwo seam bowlers are usually expected to bowl in tandem for the first 10 or so overs, after which time the ball may begin to swing and one or both of them is substituted for a swing bowler or a [[spin bowling|spin bowler]]. This is why most sides opt to include at least two seam bowlers who are known as ''opening bowlers''. Seam bowling usually becomes very ineffective with older balls and is virtually useless after 60 overs or so and as a result the bowling places in the side are filled with swing or spin bowlers.\n\n=== Deployment of fielders ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nFielding for a fast bowler is usually aggressive, that is to say that it is set up for the purpose of getting a wicket rather than preventing the flow of runs. On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required. As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling \u2013 that task is better suited to spin bowlers.\n\nThe various techniques of fast bowling lend themselves to three ways of getting the batsman out. They may be bowled or caught [[leg before wicket|LBW]] either by speed, the [[yorker]] or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant. Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman in which case the ball strikes the outside edge of the bat and may be caught in the slips. A badly-played [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.\n\nIt follows that the most effective [[fielding (cricket)|field placements]] for aggressive fast bowling are to pack the [[fielding (cricket)#outfield|outfield]] and the [[fielding (cricket)#slips|slips cordon]] and [[fielding (cricket)#gully|gully]] since these are the positions in which the batsman is most likely to be caught. Placing fielders in the outfield has the additional benefit of limiting the number of places where a batsman can score a [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]]. Other [[fielding (cricket)#close fielding positions|close fielding positions]] such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.\n\nIn contrast, a defensive field for fast bowling packs the positions\u2014such as gully, point, and cover\u2014in a full circle round the batsman. One or two slips and one or two outfielders remain in case of a catch. Because batsmen usually try and play shots down on to the ground rather than risking being caught this field can stop most boundaries while remaining close enough to the pitch to attempt to [[run out]] the batsmen if they attempt a single. Defensive fast bowling is difficult because a skilled batsman set this type of field simply trusts in technique and scores from boundaries that they hit over the midwicket ring and away from any outfielders present.\n\n=== Bowling an over ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nThe primary goal of any bowler is to take the wicket of the batsman. The secondary goal is to prevent the batsman scoring runs. The latter is often a route to the former as a batsman deprived of runs often becomes frustrated and more likely to attempt risky shots to score. In addition, stopping the batsman from scoring keeps the same batsman at the crease to face consecutive balls, which can form a tactical sequence.\n\nCounter-intuitively, the best approach for a fast bowler is not to bowl constantly at the wicket as such predictability allows the batsman to simply defend his or her wicket and pick off the occasional bad ball. A far more effective approach is to introduce variation of line and length, leaving the batsman unsure as to whether to attack, defend or leave. The majority of balls in a well-bowled spell are usually swinging or seaming balls that pass at waist height, just outside the off stump and move away from the batsman because this is the area where it is most difficult for the batsman to choose the most appropriate response. Common variations and their tactical application are discussed below.\n\nThe precise balls the bowler chooses during an over depend on the situation of the match, skill of the batsman, and how settled the batsman is at the crease. It is common to attack batsmen who have recently come to the wicket with successive short-pitched balls or bouncers with the dual aim of getting them out and stopping them from settling into an attacking mode of play for as long as possible. Short balls are more risky against batsmen who have settled at the crease since they make easy boundaries, but most bowlers still mix a few in during a spell, just to keep the batsman guessing.\n\nMost batsmen prefer to play shots off either the front or back foot and this influences the bowlers' choice of balls. It is difficult to play short balls off the front foot so bowlers bowl more short balls at batsmen who prefer the front foot. Likewise, it is hard to play yorkers and full pitched balls off the back foot so those are the deliveries of choice against back foot players. If a bowler can successfully get a batsman playing off his or her less-favoured foot with a sequence of appropriately pitched balls he can then gain an element of surprise by suddenly throwing down the ''opposite'' kind of ball \u2013 a yorker after a succession of short balls or a bouncer after a succession of full balls. An unobservant or complacent batsman can easily be caught unawares and lose their wicket.\n\nAnother variation, especially against batsmen who have settled at the wicket and are starting to score more freely, is to switch the line of attack from the area just outside the off stump to bowling directly at leg stump. The batsman has to react to these balls as he otherwise runs a high risk of being bowled or trapped [[leg before wicket|LBW]] but as he or she does so his or her bat moves over to the leg side, leaving the off side vulnerable. If the bowler can induce enough movement to the off side with swing or seam techniques, it often catches the outside edge of the bat, offering a catch or strike the stumps directly.\n\nSurprise is a big element in bowling, and bowlers often shun common tactical approaches in the hope of simply confusing the batsman into playing the wrong shot. For example, bowling a [[yorker]] at a new batsman who likely expects [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]] or at least standard line and length balls has made many batsmen lose their wicket first ball.\n\n== Role by region ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn most cricketing countries, fast bowlers are considered to be the mainstay of a team's bowling attack, with slower bowlers in support roles. On the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]], the reverse is often true, with fast bowlers serving mainly to soften the ball up for the spinners. This is largely due to the condition of the pitches used in those countries, which gives more help to spinners than to fast bowlers, but at international level it also reflects the skills of their spinners compared to their pace bowlers. \n\n== Risks of injuries ==\nFast bowlers typically experience the highest incidence of injury of all player roles in cricket.<ref>[https://www.johnorchard.com/resources/CA2014InjuryReportfinal.pdf Link text], Orchard et al. 2011, Injury report 2011: Cricket Australia, Sports Health, vo,  29, iss. 4.</ref> The largest time-loss injuries are typically associated with overuse at the site of the [[lumbar spine]]. Common injuries include [[spondylolisthesis]] (stress fracture of the lower back), navicular stress fractures in the foot, SLAP tears or lesions, [[side strain]]s or intercostal strains and muscular strains of the calves, hamstrings or spinal erectors. Popular media and commentators are often critical of the number of injuries suffered by fast bowlers. However, as of 2019, injury rates are at their lowest in decades, in many parts thanks to advances in physical conditioning, sport science, and load management interventions.\n\n==Top five fast

sidebar |expanded=all}}\n'''Pace bowler''' (also referred to as '''fast bowling''') is one of two main approaches to [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] in the sport of [[cricket]], the other being [[spin bowling]]. Practitioners of pace bowling are usually known as ''fast'' bowlers, ''quicks'', or ''pacemen''. They can also be referred to as a ''seam'' bowler, a ''swing'' bowler or a 'fast bowler who can swing it' to reflect the predominant characteristic of their deliveries. Strictly speaking, a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace, though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level these days.\n\nThe aim of pace bowling is to deliver the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake. The bowler achieves this by making the hard [[cricket ball]] deviate from a predictable, linear trajectory at a speed that limits the time the batsman has to compensate for it. For deviation caused by the ball's stitching (the seam), the ball bounces off the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] and deflects either away from the batsman's body, or inwards towards them. Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way. To 'bowl swing' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air. Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation, body position at the point of release, asymmetric ball polishing, and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball. The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement' can make it difficult for the [[batsman]] to address the flight of the ball accurately. Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory, the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly, or at all. A typical fast delivery by a professional has a speed in the range of {{convert|85|-|95|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n[[File:Graham Onions bowling, 2012.ogv|thumb|300px|Fast bowler [[Graham Onions]] bowling for [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in the [[2012 Friends Life t20]]]]\n[[File:John blain yuvraj singh odi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Scotland's fast bowler [[John Blain (cricketer)|John Blain]] hits the wicket of India's [[Yuvraj Singh]], 2007]]\n\n== Categorisation ==\nIt is possible for a bowler to concentrate solely on speed, especially when young, but as fast bowlers mature they may develop the skills of [[swing bowling]] or [[seam bowling]] techniques, both of which aim to move the ball laterally. Many fast bowlers specialise in one of these two areas and are sometimes categorised as a swing or seam bowler. However, this classification is not satisfactory because the categories are not mutually exclusive{{fact|date=September 2019}} and a skilled bowler usually bowls a mixture of fast, swinging, seaming, and also [[Off cutter|cutting]] balls\u2014even if they prefer one style to the others.{{cn|date=September 2019}} For simplicity, it is common to subdivide fast bowlers according to the average speed of their deliveries, as follows.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Classification of fast bowlers<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.cricvision.com/fast-bowling-classification-speed/ |title= Fast Bowling: Classification by Speed |publisher= Cricvision |date= 30 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n!

For comparison, most spin bowlers in professional cricket bowl at average speeds of 70 to 90&nbsp;km/h (45 to 55&nbsp;mph).  [[Shoaib Akhtar]], [[Brett Lee]], [[Shaun Tait]], [[Jeff Thomson]] (in an exhibition match) and [[Mitchell Starc]] have clocked over 160&nbsp;km/h and are categorised as \u2018Ultra Fast\u2019 bowlers although often bowling at speeds significantly lower than this mark. Also, while [[Steven Finn (cricketer)|Steven Finn]] is classified as a fast-medium bowler by Cricinfo, he can consistently bowl at around 145&nbsp;km/h, with his fastest clocked at 151.9&nbsp;km/h, making him the 10th fastest amongst active bowlers as of 3 January 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1H5UvS34wc|title=TOP 10 Fastest Bowlers in Current Cricket|first=|last=Cricket Bits|date=3 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== Technique ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket Grip fast.png|thumb|Fast-bowling grip]]\n\n=== Grip ===\nThe first thing a fast bowler needs to do is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close together at the top of the seam with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of the seam. The image on the top shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls \u2013 see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.\n\n=== Run-up ===\n[[File:Bowling action.png|thumb|upright=3|centre|Typical action of a fast bowler, starting with ''Run-up'' at the extreme left]]\nA fast bowler needs to take a longer run-up toward the wicket than a spinner, due to the need to generate the momentum and rhythm required to bowl a fast delivery. Fast bowlers measure their preferred run up in strides, and mark the distance from the wicket. It is important for the bowler to know exactly how long the run-up is because it must terminate behind the [[popping crease]]. A bowler who steps beyond this has bowled a [[no-ball]], which affords the batsman immunity from dismissal, adds one run to the batting team's score, and forces the bowler to bowl another ball in the over.\n\n=== Action ===\n[[File:Brett Lee Bowling.jpg|thumb|right|Brett Lee bowling against South Africa at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]] in 2005]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAt the end of the run-up the bowler brings his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as straight as possible. This helps generate speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure it places on the joint. Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the [[England cricket team|English]] pace bowler [[David Lawrence (cricketer)|David Lawrence]] was sidelined for many months after splitting his [[kneecap]] in two. The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe. The bowler then brings the bowling arm up over their head and releases the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch. Again, the arm must be straight though this is a stipulation of the [[laws of cricket]] rather than an aid to speed. Bending the elbow and \"chucking\" the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.\n[[File:Mitchell Johnson.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] bowling. Note the \"sling shot\" action.]]\nFast bowlers tend to have an action that leaves them either side-on or chest-on at the end of the run up. A chest-on bowler has chest and hips aligned towards the batsman at the instant of [[back foot contact]], while a side-on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of back foot contact. West Indian bowler [[Malcolm Marshall]] was a classic example of a chest-on bowler, while Australian pace bowler [[Dennis Lillee]] used a side-on technique to great effect.\n\nWhile a bowler's action does not affect their bowling speed, it can limit the style of balls that they can bowl. Although this is not a hard and fast rule, side-on bowlers generally bowl [[outswinger]]s, and chest-on bowlers generally bowl [[inswinger]]s.\n\nA variant on the fast bowler's action is the sling (sometimes referred to as the slingshot or javelin), where the bowler begins his delivery with his or her arm fully extended behind their back. The slinging action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control. The most famous exponent of the slinging action was [[Jeff Thomson]], who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up. Other international examples include [[Fidel Edwards]], [[Shaun Tait]], [[Lasith Malinga]], [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]], [[Shoaib Akhtar]] and [[Jasprit Bumrah]].\n\n=== Follow through ===\n[[File:Matthew Hoggard bowl.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Matthew Hoggard]] begins his follow-through in training.]]\nAfter the ball has been released, the bowler \"follows through\" at the end of his or her action. This involves veering to the side so as not to tread on the pitch and taking a few more strides to slow down. Striding on to the protected area of the pitch at the end of a delivery can damage the surface, making rough patches that [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]] can exploit to get extra turn on the ball; doing so is illegal according to the laws of the game. Bowlers who persistently run onto the pitch can be warned, with three warnings disqualifying a bowler from bowling again during the [[innings]].\n\n== Line and length ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAn effective fast bowler must be able to hold a consistent [[line and length]], or in common terms, to be accurate. In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler [[Glenn McGrath]] and South African pace bowler [[Shaun Pollock]].\n\n=== Line ===\n\nIn modern cricket, the two lines usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the so-called ''[[corridor of uncertainty]]'', the area just outside the batsman's [[stump (cricket)|off stump]], or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as [[off theory]] (contrast [[leg theory]]), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.\n\nPrecise mastery of the line of the ball is best used when a batsman is known to have a weakness hitting a particular shot, because a bowler with an effective line can place the ball in the weak spot time after time. Failing to overcome a persistent inability to hit balls on a certain line has been enough to end the careers of innumerable batsmen once they had been found out by skilled line bowlers.\n\n=== Length ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket delivery lengths en.svg|frame|right|Lengths of balls showing name & bounce height (arriving at the batsman). Angles are exaggerated.]]\nA [[good length ball]] is one that makes the batsman unsure whether he should play forward or back to the delivery. There is no fixed distance to a good length, or indeed any other length of ball in cricket since the distance required varies with ball speed, the state of the pitch, and heights of the bowler and batsman. Note that bowling a \"good length\" in this sense is not always appropriate\u2014in some situations, on some pitches and against some batsmen other lengths are more effective. The diagram to the right explains the different lengths.\n\nA ball that bounces a little way before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen is said to be ''short pitched'' or described as a ''long hop'' and is easier for a batsman to hit as he has had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing.{{Dubious|date=September 2015}} A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking [[pull shot]]. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] and can be an effective delivery. Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called [[wide (cricket)|wide]] by the [[umpire (cricket)|Umpire]]. Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, balls that bounce slightly closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be ''full pitched'' or ''overpitched'' or described as a ''half volley''. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the [[yorker]]. An effective yorker's length is difficult to pick early, forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well-bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a ''[[full toss]]''. It is easier for a batsman to play such a delivery as it has not deviated from bouncing off the pitch.\n\nBecause the three effective lengths (good length, bouncer and yorker) are all interspersed by lengths that are easier for the batsman to hit, control of length is an important discipline for a fast bowler. In addition to all the above variables, batsmen control how far out of the crease they face, further complicating the bowler's task of correct length estimation. [[Spin bowling|Spin bowlers]] on the other hand are almost always aiming for the good length, but need a much finer control of flight and line to be effective.\nA fast bowler tries to be physically fit throughout his cricket career, which may span more than a decade.\n\n== Strike bowling ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nStrike bowling is the term usually applied to bowlers that are used mainly to get a batsman out at the possible expense of runs if the wicket-taking is unsuccessful. For fast bowlers, this can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, rather than trying to make the ball move through the air or off the pitch. More commonly however, aggressive bowling techniques can be combined with [[swing bowling]] and [[seam bowling]] techniques to create nigh-on unplayable balls in the hands of a bowler of any speed. The inswinging [[yorker]] is seen as particularly deadly.\n\n=== Bouncer ===\n{{main|Bouncer (cricket)}}\n\nA bouncer (or bumper) is a ball aimed to pitch in the first half of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or head height by the time it reaches the batsman. This causes two problems for the batsman who receives the ball. If they try to play it, their bat is at eye-level making it difficult to visually track the ball to the bat and time the shot correctly. If they leave or miss the ball, it may strike them painfully on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury. For this reason, bowling spells containing many bouncers are said to be ''intimidatory bowling''.\n\nThe usual response to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible, as the likely result is that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy [[catch (cricket)|catch]]. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.\n\nPhysically powerful batsmen often attempt to strike the ball on the rise, even though this obstructs their vision of the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of the ball makes it fly to the boundary. This possibility, combined with the difficulty that the [[wicketkeeper]] has trying to stop a high ball, means that bouncers can be expensive in terms of runs against skilled batsmen.\n\n=== Slower ball ===\n{{main|Slower ball}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket Grip slower.png|thumb|Slower ball grip]]\n\nA slower ball is a ball delivered exactly like a usual pace delivery in terms of action and run-up but where the grip is changed slightly to slow the ball down. This deceives the batsman, who will likely try to play the ball as though it were at full speed, making them mistime the shot. The result is usually that the ball strikes lower down the bat, making it leave the bat at a slower speed. (A cricket bat has a ''middle'' \u2013 hitting the ball at this point transfers the maximum possible energy to the ball. Hitting the ball away from the ''middle'' transfers less energy, producing less speed.) Also, the bat generally has travelled further when it hits the ball, and is in the upward part of its arc, so it leaves the bat at a steeper angle. The combination of these can be a slow-moving, looping ball that  is relatively easy to catch. In an extreme case, the batsman plays the shot so early as to completely play over the ball, and be [[Bowled|clean-bowled]].\n\nOne of a number of different grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially the only difference is that the middle and index fingers are split and come down on each side of the seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by [[off spin]]ners. A slower delivery may also be achieved \u2013 less commonly \u2013 by using a [[leg spin]] grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.\n\nThe slower ball is particularly effective against a batsman seeking to score quickly. Consequently, its prominence has increased with the development of [[one-day cricket]] and [[Twenty20 cricket]], and particularly when \"[[Glossary of cricket terms#Death overs|bowling at the death]]\" (at the end of an innings) where batsman attack with abandon.\n\nA more experienced batsman can adjust a shot mid-stroke, momentarily pausing so as to ''middle'' the ball when it is hit.\n\nIn another version of the slower ball, also known as the SLOB, the bowler releases the ball with the top fingers only. Aimed as a \"beamer\", the delivery method makes the ball drop dramatically in flight and arrive at a ''yorker'' length. This was most famously used by [[Chris Cairns]] to [[Chris Read]], causing him to duck into a full length ball that [[bowled|went on to the stumps]].\n\n=== Yorker ===\n{{main|Yorker}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nA yorker ball bounces off the pitch right in front of (or is aimed at the toes of) the batsman's feet, an area known as the ''block hole''. Because of the usual stance of the batsman and the regulation length of the [[cricket bat]] the bat is not usually held near the ground while the batsman prepares to strike the ball, so playing a yorker requires the batsman to alter the height of his or her bat very quickly after detecting a yorker has been bowled. This is difficult, and the yorker can often squeeze through the gap and break the wicket. Successfully playing this type of delivery is also known as ''digging out'' a yorker.\n\nBowling a yorker requires pinpoint accuracy, since bowling it slightly too long results in a [[full toss]] or full pitched delivery that is easy for the batsman to play because the ball has not deviated by bouncing off the pitch. It also has most of its value as a surprise ball. For these two reasons, yorkers are not common deliveries in most circumstances.\n\nIn the latter stages of an innings in [[one day cricket]], batters seek to attack every ball bowled.  In such circumstances, the yorker is a particularly effective delivery, both in taking wickets and preventing boundaries from being hit.  Therefore, the yorker is very frequently bowled in these circumstances, and bowlers who can bowl yorkers accurately are prized in this form of cricket.\n\n== Seam bowling ==\n{{main|Seam bowling}}\n[[File:Andrew Flintoff bowl.jpg|90px|left|thumb|[[Andrew Flintoff]] of England bowls in the nets, watched by [[Kevin Shine]]. Note the upright seam]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nSeam bowling is the act of using the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an unpredictable fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman can predict where a ball is going to bounce, and from that work out what the height of the ball will be when it reaches the bat. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely that the batsman will make a mistake in this assessment give away their wicket.\n\nSeam deliveries can be bowled at any pace, but most specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace. The basic technique of seam bowling is to employ the normal fast bowling or slower ball grip and to try to ensure that the seam remains upright until the ball hits the pitch. If the seam is upright and the ball is spinning around its horizontal axis, there is no appreciable [[Magnus effect]], and the ball does not move in the air. The seam of the ball is raised and causes variations in bounce and movement if it is the first part of the ball to hit the pitch.\n\nSeam bowlers can get a lot of help from certain types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the hardness makes it easier to bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to the unpredictability of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as ''variable bounce''. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. [[Cricket pitch|Green pitches]] can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a ''flat track'' in cricket [[vernacular]]) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.\n\n=== Cutters ===\n{{main|Leg cutter|Off cutter}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Cricket Grip legcutter.png|thumb|Leg-cutter grip]]\n[[File:Cricket Grip offcutter.png|thumb|Off-cutter grip]]\n\nA cutter is a fast ball that is spinning, that is, a delivery that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead of keeping the seam straight. While this rotation is nowhere near as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still enough to make a batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball. Cutters can be an effective way for a seam bowler to get the ball to move if he or she is not receiving much assistance from the pitch.\n\nA ball rotating around the seam moves either right or left when it hits the pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right is said to be an off cutter as it is travelling from [[Stump (cricket)|off stump]] to [[leg stump]] for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This makes the ball catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle, and fly up to be caught in the [[Fielding positions in cricket|slips]].\n\nTo bowl a cutter, the bowler uses a different grip. The two grips are shown to the right, with the uppermost one producing a [[leg cutter]] while the lower one shows the grip required for an [[off cutter]]. As well as changing the grip, the bowler must pull his or her fingers down the appropriate side of the ball as it leaves their hand to impart the required spin. The action of bowling a cutter also increases drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, causing the ball to slow in the same way as a slower ball and this can also help to confuse the batsman.\n\n== Swing bowling ==\n{{main|Swing bowling}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nSwing bowlers cause the ball to move laterally through the air, rather than off the pitch like seam bowlers. Normal or conventional swing bowling is encouraged by the raised seam of the ball,<ref name=\"Science\">{{Cite web|title = The science of swing bowling|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/258645.html|accessdate = 16 July 2015}}</ref> and conventional swing is usually greatest when the ball is new and therefore has a pronounced seam. As the ball gets older, the wear makes swing more difficult to achieve, but this can be countered if the fielding team systematically polishes one side of the ball while allowing the other to become rough. When the ball has been polished highly on one side and not on the other and if the ball is bowled very fast (over 85 miles per hour), it produces a [[reverse swing]] such that the ball swings in the opposite direction as in conventional swing. Contrary to popular opinion, this [[reverse swing|swing]] is not produced by air flowing faster over the smooth or \"shiny\" side as compared to the rough side.\n\nSwing is produced due to a net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[boundary layer]]. For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction it points governs the direction of swing. Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on the side that the seam is angled toward. This causes the boundary layer to separate from the surface of the ball later (farther toward the rear of the ball) than the other side where it separates earlier (farther forward on the surface). The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam. Conventional swing bowling is delivered with the seam angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of the seam ''i.e.'' toward the rough side.\n\nA swinging ball is classed as either an outswinger, which moves away from the batsman, or an inswinger, which moves in toward the batsman.<ref name=\"Science\"/> In most cases the outswinger is seen as the more dangerous ball because, if the batsman fails to recognise it, it catches the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the [[Fielding positions in cricket|slips]]. Inswingers have their place too, especially combined with the [[yorker]] as this can result in the ball either breaking the wicket (by going clean \"through the gate\" or getting an inside edge) or hitting the pad rather than the bat (resulting in a possible [[leg before wicket|LBW]] decision).\n\nSwing bowling can also be roughly categorised as early swing or late swing, corresponding to when in the trajectory the ball changes direction. The later the ball swings, the less chance the batter has of adjusting to account for the swing.\n\nBowlers usually use the same grip and technique on swing balls as fast balls, though they usually keep the seam slightly rather than straight, and may use the slower ball grip. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball spins in flight, varying the orientation of the shiny and rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in [[Test cricket]] swings more than the white ball used in the [[One Day International|one-day game]].\n\n=== Reverse swing ===\n[[Reverse swing]] is a phenomenon that makes the ball swing in the opposite direction to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball.<ref name=\"Science\" /> When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball swings towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman has in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90&nbsp;mph a ball always exhibits reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases.<ref name=\"Science\" /> This means that an older ball is more likely to be delivered with reverse swing as its surface is roughened through use.\n\nIn [[reverse swing|reverse]] swing the seam is angled in the same way as in conventional swing (10\u201320 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by [[dimples]] in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back \u2013 this enables the golf ball to travel farther.\n\nThe discovery of reverse swing is credited to Pakistan's cricketers, with [[Sarfraz Nawaz]] and [[Farrakh Khan]] both named as originators of the delivery.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/10963855/How-Pakistan-became-the-kings-of-swing.html|title = How Pakistan became the kings of swing|last = Oborne|first = Peter|date = 12 July 2014|work = The Telegraph|access-date = 16 July 2015|via = }}</ref>\n\nNow, in [[one-day cricket]] the mandatory two new balls rule (which states that two new balls must be used at the start of each innings; one from each end) means that the chances of reverse swing are reduced drastically. With two new balls being used, the amount of wear that each ball is subject to is half as compared to usual.\n\n=== Dippers ===\n{{see also|Inswinger|Outswinger}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nA dipper is a swinging ball deliberately bowled as a yorker or a [[full toss]], the latter not normally being a ball that a fast bowler would choose to bowl. The indipper moves in to the right-handed batsman while the outdipper moves away.\n\nTo be effective, a dipper has to generate a lot of swing to make up for the variation in movement lost because the ball is not bouncing on the pitch. However, because the batsman usually expects a full toss to be an easy ball to score off, dippers have huge surprise value and can be extremely difficult to play especially if the bowler is very accurate and manages the yorker rather than a genuine full toss. [[Chaminda Vaas]]' bowling to [[Yuvraj Singh]] in the [[2007\u201308 Commonwealth Bank Series]] is a classic example.\n\n== Intimidatory bowling ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIntimidatory or aggressive bowling is a legitimate tactic of bowling with the intent of hitting the batsman with the ball. This is somewhat restrained by some of the laws of cricket, including those that disallow excessive use of bouncers and any use of the ''beamer'', which is aimed directly at the head on the full. Successful intimidatory bowling usually employs a mixture of bouncers and short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman's head, chest, and rib cage. The intention is to disrupt a batsman's focus, and ultimately induce a mistake that leads to the loss of the batsman's wicket. Often the eventual wicket doesn't fall to a bouncer or short-pitched ball, but instead to a more standard delivery that the batsman is no longer expecting, or is rendered temporarily unable to play in his usual way (by fear, pain, surprise, or some combination of the three).\n\nOne classic approach is to deliver several short balls into the batsman's chest, forcing the batsman onto the back foot to defend with a high bat, and then fire in a fast yorker, aimed at the base of the stumps. If the batsman is expecting to play a high back foot defensive, the time it takes to shift their weight to play the ball at their feet may just be enough for the delivery to surprise the batsman and cause him or her to panic, and thus cause the loss of their wicket.\n\nA fast bowler can also employ intimidatory tactics to anger (or frustrate) a batsman into playing a rash shot, by directing the ball to strike the batsman. Intimidatory bowling plays a part in every fast bowler's attack to some degree, and even the best batsmen sometimes sustain serious injuries that can force them off the field and out of the game. In almost all instances verbal '[[Sledging (cricket)|sledging]]' accompanies the attack.\n\nExcessive use of intimidatory tactics by elite fast bowlers is considered [[unsportsmanlike conduct|unsportsmanlike]], and is shunned by many teams and players. One instance of excessive use was the [[Bodyline]] series, where the [[English Cricket Captain]] at the time (1932\u20131933), [[Douglas Jardine]], employed a tactic to restrain the skills of the [[Australian cricket team]], and their star player, [[Donald Bradman]]. The tactic was to bowl, very fast and very short, at the batsman's body. After the [[Bodyline series]], as it became known, several laws of cricket were altered to prevent such a tactic being used again, such as a restriction on the number of fielders that can occupy the rear leg-side quadrant of the cricket to two (excluding the wicketkeeper).\n\n== Tactics ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nBecause nearly all cricket teams contain several fast bowlers of differing speeds and styles, the tactics of fast bowling depends not only on changing the [[Fielding positions in cricket|field placements]] but on changing the bowler and the types and sequences of deliveries bowled as well. The precise tactics are determined by many factors including the state of the game, the state of the pitch, the weather and the relative energy and skill levels of the various players available to bowl.\n\nFast bowling requires a great deal of energy and most fast bowlers can be expected to bowl a spell of 4\u20136 overs in a row before requiring a rest. Depending on conditions, they may be required by the team to bowl a longer spell although this usually results in drop in effectiveness toward the end of the spell as the bowler tires. Choosing which balls to bowl as part of a spell and what order to bowl them in is a tactical discipline all of its own.\n\n=== Deployment of bowlers ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMost sides contain a mixture of fast bowlers who specialise in aggressive or seam techniques and those who specialise in swing. When the ball is new it usually swings very little, but generates a lot of speed, bounce and variation off the seam (because the seam on a new ball stands out more than that on an old ball). So, seam bowlers are usually chosen to bowl with the new ball either at the start of an innings or when a new ball has been taken, an option the fielding side has once a ball is 80 overs old. In contrast, swing bowlers are more effective once the ball has started to wear and reverse swing requires a well worn ball. Reverse swing bowlers can continue to extract large amounts of movement from balls well over 80 overs old.Then again according to conditions the new ball can swing too.\n\nTwo seam bowlers are usually expected to bowl in tandem for the first 10 or so overs, after which time the ball may begin to swing and one or both of them is substituted for a swing bowler or a [[spin bowling|spin bowler]]. This is why most sides opt to include at least two seam bowlers who are known as ''opening bowlers''. Seam bowling usually becomes very ineffective with older balls and is virtually useless after 60 overs or so and as a result the bowling places in the side are filled with swing or spin bowlers.\n\n=== Deployment of fielders ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nFielding for a fast bowler is usually aggressive, that is to say that it is set up for the purpose of getting a wicket rather than preventing the flow of runs. On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required. As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling \u2013 that task is better suited to spin bowlers.\n\nThe various techniques of fast bowling lend themselves to three ways of getting the batsman out. They may be bowled or caught [[leg before wicket|LBW]] either by speed, the [[yorker]] or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant. Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman in which case the ball strikes the outside edge of the bat and may be caught in the slips. A badly-played [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.\n\nIt follows that the most effective [[fielding (cricket)|field placements]] for aggressive fast bowling are to pack the [[fielding (cricket)#outfield|outfield]] and the [[fielding (cricket)#slips|slips cordon]] and [[fielding (cricket)#gully|gully]] since these are the positions in which the batsman is most likely to be caught. Placing fielders in the outfield has the additional benefit of limiting the number of places where a batsman can score a [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]]. Other [[fielding (cricket)#close fielding positions|close fielding positions]] such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.\n\nIn contrast, a defensive field for fast bowling packs the positions\u2014such as gully, point, and cover\u2014in a full circle round the batsman. One or two slips and one or two outfielders remain in case of a catch. Because batsmen usually try and play shots down on to the ground rather than risking being caught this field can stop most boundaries while remaining close enough to the pitch to attempt to [[run out]] the batsmen if they attempt a single. Defensive fast bowling is difficult because a skilled batsman set this type of field simply trusts in technique and scores from boundaries that they hit over the midwicket ring and away from any outfielders present.\n\n=== Bowling an over ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nThe primary goal of any bowler is to take the wicket of the batsman. The secondary goal is to prevent the batsman scoring runs. The latter is often a route to the former as a batsman deprived of runs often becomes frustrated and more likely to attempt risky shots to score. In addition, stopping the batsman from scoring keeps the same batsman at the crease to face consecutive balls, which can form a tactical sequence.\n\nCounter-intuitively, the best approach for a fast bowler is not to bowl constantly at the wicket as such predictability allows the batsman to simply defend his or her wicket and pick off the occasional bad ball. A far more effective approach is to introduce variation of line and length, leaving the batsman unsure as to whether to attack, defend or leave. The majority of balls in a well-bowled spell are usually swinging or seaming balls that pass at waist height, just outside the off stump and move away from the batsman because this is the area where it is most difficult for the batsman to choose the most appropriate response. Common variations and their tactical application are discussed below.\n\nThe precise balls the bowler chooses during an over depend on the situation of the match, skill of the batsman, and how settled the batsman is at the crease. It is common to attack batsmen who have recently come to the wicket with successive short-pitched balls or bouncers with the dual aim of getting them out and stopping them from settling into an attacking mode of play for as long as possible. Short balls are more risky against batsmen who have settled at the crease since they make easy boundaries, but most bowlers still mix a few in during a spell, just to keep the batsman guessing.\n\nMost batsmen prefer to play shots off either the front or back foot and this influences the bowlers' choice of balls. It is difficult to play short balls off the front foot so bowlers bowl more short balls at batsmen who prefer the front foot. Likewise, it is hard to play yorkers and full pitched balls off the back foot so those are the deliveries of choice against back foot players. If a bowler can successfully get a batsman playing off his or her less-favoured foot with a sequence of appropriately pitched balls he can then gain an element of surprise by suddenly throwing down the ''opposite'' kind of ball \u2013 a yorker after a succession of short balls or a bouncer after a succession of full balls. An unobservant or complacent batsman can easily be caught unawares and lose their wicket.\n\nAnother variation, especially against batsmen who have settled at the wicket and are starting to score more freely, is to switch the line of attack from the area just outside the off stump to bowling directly at leg stump. The batsman has to react to these balls as he otherwise runs a high risk of being bowled or trapped [[leg before wicket|LBW]] but as he or she does so his or her bat moves over to the leg side, leaving the off side vulnerable. If the bowler can induce enough movement to the off side with swing or seam techniques, it often catches the outside edge of the bat, offering a catch or strike the stumps directly.\n\nSurprise is a big element in bowling, and bowlers often shun common tactical approaches in the hope of simply confusing the batsman into playing the wrong shot. For example, bowling a [[yorker]] at a new batsman who likely expects [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]] or at least standard line and length balls has made many batsmen lose their wicket first ball.\n\n== Role by region ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn most cricketing countries, fast bowlers are considered to be the mainstay of a team's bowling attack, with slower bowlers in support roles. On the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]], the reverse is often true, with fast bowlers serving mainly to soften the ball up for the spinners. This is largely due to the condition of the pitches used in those countries, which gives more help to spinners than to fast bowlers, but at international level it also reflects the skills of their spinners compared to their pace bowlers. \n\n== Risks of injuries ==\nFast bowlers typically experience the highest incidence of injury of all player roles in cricket.<ref>[https://www.johnorchard.com/resources/CA2014InjuryReportfinal.pdf Link text], Orchard et al. 2011, Injury report 2011: Cricket Australia, Sports Health, vo,  29, iss. 4.</ref> The largest time-loss injuries are typically associated with overuse at the site of the [[lumbar spine]]. Common injuries include [[spondylolisthesis]] (stress fracture of the lower back), navicular stress fractures in the foot, SLAP tears or lesions, [[side strain]]s or intercostal strains and muscular strains of the calves, hamstrings or spinal erectors. Popular media and commentators are often critical of the number of injuries suffered by fast bowlers. However, as of 2019, injury rates are at their lowest in decades, in many parts thanks to advances in physical conditioning, sport science, and load management interventions.\n\n==Top five fast bowlers==\n{{see also|Test cricket bowling records|One Day International cricket bowling records|Twenty20 International cricket bowling records}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Top five fast bowlers in [[Test cricket|Tests]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;template=results;type=bowling|title=Records \u2013 Test Matches \u2013 Bowling records \u2013 Most wickets in career \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n| label_type  = Name\n| data_type   = Wickets taken\n| bar_width   = 30\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 700\n| label1   = {{cricon|England}} [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]]\n| data1    = 583\n| label2   = {{cricon|Australia}} [[Glenn McGrath]]\n| data2    = 563\n| label3   = {{cricon|West Indies}} [[Courtney Walsh]]\n| data3    = 519\n| label4   = {{cricon|England}} [[Stuart Broad]]\n| data4    = 485\n| label5   = {{cricon|South Africa}} [[Dale Steyn]]\n| data5    = 439\n}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Top five fast bowlers in [[One Day International|ODI]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;template=results;type=bowling|title=Records \u2013 One Day Internationals \u2013 Bowling records \u2013 Most wickets in career \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n| label_type  = Name\n| data_type   = Wickets taken\n| bar_width   = 30\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 600\n| label1   = {{cricon|Pakistan}} [[Wasim Akram]]\n| data1    = 502\n| label2   = {{cricon|Pakistan}} [[Waqar Younis]]\n| data2    = 416\n| label3   = {{cricon|Sri Lanka}} [[Chaminda Vaas]]\n| data3    = 400\n| label4  = {{cricon|South Africa}} [[Shaun Pollock]]\n| data4    = 393\n| label5   = {{cricon|Australia}} [[Glenn McGrath]]\n| data5    = 381\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Top five fast bowlers in [[T20I]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=3;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;template=results;type=bowling|title=Records \u2013 Twenty20 Internationals \u2013 Bowling records \u2013 Most wickets in career \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n| label_type  = Name\n| data_type   = Wickets taken\n| bar_width   = 30\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 125\n| label1   = {{cricon|Sri Lanka}} [[Lasith Malinga]]\n| data1    = 104\n| label2   = {{cricon|Pakistan}} [[Umar Gul]]\n| data2    =  85\n| label3   = {{cricon|New Zealand}} [[Tim Southee]]\n| data3    = 71\n| label4   = {{cricon|Sri Lanka}} [[Nuwan Kulasekara]]\n| data4    = 66\n| label5   = {{cricon|England}} [[Stuart Broad]]\n| data5    = 65\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Fastest '''Recorded''' Deliveries in history of Cricket<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sporteology.com/top-10-fastest-bowlers-in-the-history-of-cricket/|title=Top 10 Fastest Bowlers in Cricket History|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n| label_type  = Bowler\n| data_type   = km/h (mph)\n| bar_width   = 20\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 175\n| label1    = {{cricon|Pakistan}} [[Shoaib Akhtar]]\n| data1     = 161.3 | comment1 = 100.2\n| label2    = {{cricon|Australia}} [[Brett Lee]] \n| data2     = 161.1 | comment2 = 100.1\n| label3    = {{cricon|Australia}} [[Shaun Tait]]\n| data3     = 161.1 | comment3 = 100.1\n| label4    = {{cricon|Australia}} [[Jeff Thomson]]\n| data4     = 160.6 | comment4 = 99.8\n| label5    = {{cricon|Australia}} [[Mitchell Starc]]\n| data5     = 160.4 | comment5 = 99.7\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n*[[Glossary of cricket terms]]\n*[[Types of bowlers in cricket]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*[[Simon Hughes (cricketer)|Hughes, Simon]] (2002), ''Jargonbusting: The Analyst's Guide to Test Cricket'', [[Channel 4 books]], {{ISBN|0-7522-6508-3}}\n*[[Tony Lewis|Lewis, Tony]] (Editor) (1995), ''[[MCC Masterclass]]'', [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-81578-4}}\n\n{{Cricket positions}}\n\n[[Category:Bowling (cricket)]]\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Aryansinghmonty", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTop five fast bowlers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_bowling"}
