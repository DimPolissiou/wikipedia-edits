Due to a loss of knowledge, there has been some confusion regarding old territorial units in Ireland, mainly between ''tr\u00edcha c\u00e9ta'' and ''t\u00faatha'', which in some cases seem to be overlapping units, and in others, different measurements altogether.<ref>https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/</ref> The ''tr\u00edcha c\u00e9ta'' were primarily for reckoning military units; specifically, the number of fighting forces a particular population could rally.<ref name=Dillon/> Some scholars equate the ''t\u00faath'' with the modern parish, whereas others equate it with the barony. This partly depends on how the territory was first incorporated into the county system. in cases where [[surrender and regrant]] was the method, the match between the old ''t\u00faath'' and the modern barony is reasonably equivalent. Whereas in cases like [[Ulster]], which involved large scale colonisation and confiscation of land, the shape of the original divisions is not always clear or recoverable.<ref>https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/</ref> \n\n==Etymology==\n\t \n''T\u00faath'' in Old Irish means both \"the people\", \"country, territory\", and \"territory, petty kingdom, the political and jurisdictional unit of ancient Ireland\".<ref name=RIA/> The word possibly derives from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''tout\u0101'' (\"tribe, tribal homeland\"; cognate roots may be found in the Gaulish god name [[Toutatis]]), which is perhaps from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''tewt\u00e9h\u2082'' (\"tribesman, tribal citizen\").{{cn|date=September 2018}} In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] it is spelled ''tuath'', without the [[Acute accent|fada]] accent, and is usually used to refer to \"rural districts\" or \"the country\" (as in \"the countryside\"); however the historical meaning is still understood and employed, as well.<ref name=ODonaill>{{cite web|last=\u00d3 D\u00f3naill|first=Niall||title=Focl\u00f3ir Gaeilge-B\u00e9arla|url=https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Tuath\n|work=teangleann.ie |date= 1977|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n*[[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]]\n*[[Tir Fhiacrach Muaidhe]]\n*[[Tir Olliol]]\n*[[Corann]]\n*[[Dartraighe]]\n*[[Osraige]] - t\u00faath that later became the kingdom of the same name in the Christian era\n*[[D\u00e1l Riata]] - the t\u00faath that became a confederation of t\u00faatha and eventually settled in [[Alba]], creating the modern nation of [[Scotland]]\n*[[Clandonnell]], [[Glenconkeyne]], [[Killetra]], [[Melanagh]], [[Tarraghter]], and [[Tomlagh]], which all once formed the ancient territory of [[Loughinsholin]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tr\u00edcha c\u00e9t]]\n* [[List of Irish kingdoms]]\n* [[Gaelic Ireland]]\n* [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Colonisation under early kings of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]'', [[Eoin Mac Neill]], ''Journal of the [[Galway Archaeological and Historical Society]], volume 16, pp.&nbsp;101\u2013124, 1935\n* ''Corpus genealogiarum Hibernia'', i, M.A. O'Brien, [[Dublin]], 1962\n* ''Early Irish Society'' Francis John Byrne, in ''The Course of Irish History'', ed.

''T\u00faatha'' were grouped together into [[confederations]] for mutual defence. There was a hierarchy of ''t\u00faatha'' statuses, depending on geographical position and connection to the ruling dynasties of the region.<ref name=NKPI>{{cite web|last=\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in|first=Donnchadh||title=Nationality and Kingship in Pre-Norman Ireland|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/nation_kingship.html|work=CELT|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}</ref> The organization of ''t\u00faatha'' is covered to a great extent within the [[Brehon law]]s, Irish laws written down in the 7th century, also known as the ''F\u00e9nechas''.<ref name=Patterson>{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Nerys t.|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= Cattle Lords and Clansmen: The Social Structure of Early Ireland|date=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Pess|location=|isbn= 978-0268161460|page=|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=JGIFDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT228&lpg=PT228&dq=gaelic+tuath+tricha+cet+organisation+medieval&source=bl&ots=334SDlStcJ&sig=n-paEMSfvKL08slwCaviZ2nvQ3E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjphsyq78_dAhUiglwKHShTArc4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=gaelic%20tuath%20tricha%20cet%20organisation%20medieval&f=false|accessdate=|chapter=}}</ref>\n\nThe old Irish political system was altered during and after the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Elizabethan conquest]], being gradually replaced by a system of [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] and [[counties]] under the new colonial system. Due to a loss of knowledge, there has been some confusion regarding old territorial units in Ireland, mainly between ''tr\u00edcha c\u00e9ta'' and ''t\u00faatha'', which in some cases seem to be overlapping units, and in others, different measurements altogether.<ref>https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/</ref> The ''tr\u00edcha c\u00e9ta'' were primarily for reckoning military units; specifically, the number of fighting forces a particular population could rally.<ref name=Dillon/> Some scholars equate the ''t\u00faath'' with the modern parish, whereas others equate it with the barony. This partly depends on how the territory was first incorporated into the county system. in cases where [[surrender and regrant]] was the method, the match between the old ''t\u00faath'' and the modern barony is reasonably equivalent. Whereas in cases like [[Ulster]], which involved large scale colonisation and confiscation of land, the shape of the original divisions is not always clear or recoverable.<ref>https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/</ref> \n\n==Etymology==\n\t \n''T\u00faath'' in Old Irish means both \"the people\", \"country, territory\", and \"territory, petty kingdom, the political and jurisdictional unit of ancient Ireland\".<ref name=RIA/> The word possibly derives from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''tout\u0101'' (\"tribe, tribal homeland\"; cognate roots may be found in the Gaulish god name [[Toutatis]]), which is perhaps from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''tewt\u00e9h\u2082'' (\"tribesman, tribal citizen\").{{cn|date=September 2018}} In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] it is spelled ''tuath'', without the [[Acute accent|fada]] accent, and is usually used to refer to \"rural districts\" or \"the country\" (as in \"the countryside\"); however the historical meaning is still understood and employed, as well.<ref name=ODonaill>{{cite web|last=\u00d3 D\u00f3naill|first=Niall||title=Focl\u00f3ir Gaeilge-B\u00e9arla|url=https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Tuath\n|work=teangleann.ie |date= 1977|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n*[[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]]\n*[[Tir Fhiacrach Muaidhe]]\n*[[Tir Olliol]]\n*[[Corann]]\n*[[Dartraighe]]\n*[[Osraige]] - t\u00faath that later became the kingdom of the same name in the Christian era\n*[[D\u00e1l Riata]] - the t\u00faath that became a confederation of t\u00faatha and eventually settled in [[Alba]], creating the modern nation of [[Scotland]]\n*[[Clandonnell]], [[Glenconkeyne]], [[Killetra]], [[Melanagh]], [[Tarraghter]], and [[Tomlagh]], which all once formed the ancient territory of [[Loughinsholin]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tr\u00edcha c\u00e9t]]\n* [[List of Irish kingdoms]]\n* [[Gaelic Ireland]]\n* [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Colonisation under early kings of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]'', [[Eoin Mac Neill]], ''Journal of the [[Galway Archaeological and Historical Society]], volume 16, pp.&nbsp;101\u2013124, 1935\n* ''Corpus genealogiarum Hibernia'', i, M.A. O'Brien, [[Dublin]], 1962\n* ''Early Irish Society'' Francis John Byrne, in ''The Course of Irish History'', ed.
