It was created by writer [[Cullen Bunn]] and artist Tyler Crook, and published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n==Characters==\n;Emmy Crawford: An eighteen-year-old young woman and witch, presumed to be the reincarnation of the witch Hester Beck, but actually the reincarnation of Amaryllis.\n\n;Bernice Anderson: Emmy's best friend, granddaughter of Riah Anderson, and student of Lovey Belfont.\n\n;Isaac Crawford: Emmy's adoptive father.

Later the story was repurposed as an ongoing comic with artist and co-creator Tyler Crook. The main character Madrigal was renamed Emmy, the time period was shifted from present day to the 1930s, and the location was changed from Ahmen's Landing to Harrow County.\n\nWhen Bunn began working on the series, he wrote the first two arcs so that they told a fairly complete story, though he hoped ''Harrow County'' would be popular enough to become an ongoing series. Crook chose to do the book in watercolors to get away from the computer and to make the project more fun for himself. As part of the promotional material for the comic, he created a special ordering form and made process videos showcasing his watercolors.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romeo |first1=Mike |title=Tyler Crook on the Process Behind \"Harrow County\" |url=http://www.multiversitycomics.com/interviews/tyler-crook-on-the-process-behind-harrow-county-exclusive-video/ |website=Multiversity Comics |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> He even wrote music for the first two arcs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crook |first1=Tyler |title=Harrow County: The Soundtrack to the Comic Book |url=https://harrowcounty.bandcamp.com/ |website=Bandcamp |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring ''Harrow County''\u2019s run, Cullen Bunn and Tyler Crook regularly shared their process in a column called ''The Harrow County Observer'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romeo |first1=Mike |last2=Tweedale |first2=Mark |title=The Harrow County Observer |url=http://www.multiversitycomics.com/tag/harrow-county-observer/ |website=Multiversity Comics |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Tyler Crook's YouTube channel,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crook |first1=Tyler |title=Mr. Tyler Crook |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/MisterCrook666 |website=YouTube |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> and in the extensive sketchbook sections of the trade paperback collections.\n\n===''Tales of Harrow County''===\nMost issues of ''Harrow County'' include ''Tales of Harrow County'' backup stories.

It was created by writer [[Cullen Bunn]] and artist Tyler Crook, and published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n==Characters==\n;Emmy Crawford: An eighteen-year-old young woman and witch, presumed to be the reincarnation of the witch Hester Beck, but actually the reincarnation of Amaryllis.\n\n;Bernice Anderson: Emmy's best friend, granddaughter of Riah Anderson, and student of Lovey Belfont.\n\n;Isaac Crawford: Emmy's adoptive father.

Emmy carries his skin around in her satchel and he whispers secrets to her.\n\n;Priscilla: A goblin that befriends Emmy.\n\n===The Family===\n;Hester Beck: A god-like witch who was killed by her own creations. She was Malachi's youngest child and favorite.\n\n;Malachi: The head of the Family in the old days, until he became the Abandoned and settled in Harrow County.\n\n;Amaryllis: A kindly old woman and the most powerful in the family, she was capable of bending all of reality to her will.

He was murdered due to Levi's meddling.\n\n==Publication history==\n''Harrow County'' began as a serialized prose story called ''Countless Haints'', written by [[Cullen Bunn]] and released on his website.<ref>Carroll, Tobias (May 26, 2016), \"[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/05/death-follows-scribe-cullen-bunn-on-crafting-horro.html Death Follows Scribe Cullen Bunn on Crafting Horror Comics and ...],\" [[Paste Magazine]] (accessed June 9, 2016)</ref> ''Countless Haints'' ran for ten chapters before it was retired. Later the story was repurposed as an ongoing comic with artist and co-creator Tyler Crook. The main character Madrigal was renamed Emmy, the time period was shifted from present day to the 1930s, and the location was changed from Ahmen's Landing to Harrow County.\n\nWhen Bunn began working on the series, he wrote the first two arcs so that they told a fairly complete story, though he hoped ''Harrow County'' would be popular enough to become an ongoing series. Crook chose to do the book in watercolors to get away from the computer and to make the project more fun for himself. As part of the promotional material for the comic, he created a special ordering form and made process videos showcasing his watercolors.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romeo |first1=Mike |title=Tyler Crook on the Process Behind \"Harrow County\" |url=http://www.multiversitycomics.com/interviews/tyler-crook-on-the-process-behind-harrow-county-exclusive-video/ |website=Multiversity Comics |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> He even wrote music for the first two arcs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crook |first1=Tyler |title=Harrow County: The Soundtrack to the Comic Book |url=https://harrowcounty.bandcamp.com/ |website=Bandcamp |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring ''Harrow County''\u2019s run, Cullen Bunn and Tyler Crook regularly shared their process in a column called ''The Harrow County Observer'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romeo |first1=Mike |last2=Tweedale |first2=Mark |title=The Harrow County Observer |url=http://www.multiversitycomics.com/tag/harrow-county-observer/ |website=Multiversity Comics |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Tyler Crook's YouTube channel,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crook |first1=Tyler |title=Mr. Tyler Crook |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/MisterCrook666 |website=YouTube |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> and in the extensive sketchbook sections of the trade paperback collections.\n\n===''Tales of Harrow County''===\nMost issues of ''Harrow County'' include ''Tales of Harrow County'' backup stories.

In the Latin Church the [[minor orders]] were abolished after the Second Vatican Council.

Though Oil of the Sick for the sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]] is blessed at this Mass, it may also be blessed by any priest in case of necessity. Only a bishop may consecrate Chrism. In the Eastern Catholic Churches chrism is consecrated solely by heads of churches ''[[Sui iuris|sui juris]]'' (patriarchs and metropolitans) and diocesan bishops may not do so.\n\nOnly a bishop or other ordinary may grant ''[[imprimatur]]s'' for theological books, certifying that they are free from doctrinal or moral error; this is an expression of the teaching authority, and education responsibility of the bishop.\n\nPrior to the [[Second Vatican Council]], it was also the prerogative of the bishop to consecrate the [[paten]] and [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] that would be used during the Mass. One of the changes implemented since the Council, is that a simple blessing is now said and it may be given by any priest.\n\n=== Canonical authority ===\n[[File:Catholic bishops at papal funeral.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Catholic bishops assembled in front of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]\n\nIn both Western and Eastern Catholic churches, any priest can celebrate the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] or [[Divine Liturgy]]. In order to offer Mass or Divine Liturgy publicly, however, a priest is required to have permission from the local Ordinary\u2014authority for this permission may be given to pastors of parishes for a limited period, but for long-term permission recourse to the diocesan bishop is usually required. A [[celebret]] may be issued to travelling priests so that they can demonstrate to pastors and bishops outside of their own diocese that they are in good standing.

In the Latin branch of the Catholic Church, the teaching is that it is the couple themselves who administer the graces of the sacrament; thus, although it is normally an ordained person who officiates at a marriage ceremony, a bishop may delegate a lay person to be present for the exchange of vows; this would be done only in extreme cases such as in mission territories. In the Eastern tradition, the clergy not only witness the exchange of vows but must impart a blessing for a valid marriage to have taken place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a7.htm#II|title=Catechism of Catholic Church para 1623|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nUnless a particular bishop has forbidden it, any bishop may preach throughout the Catholic Church<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2I.HTM|title=Canon 763|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> and any priest or deacon may also preach anywhere (presuming the permission of local pastor) unless his faculty to preach has been restricted or removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2I.HTM|title=Canon 764|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[cathedral]] of a diocese contains a special chair, called a ''[[cathedra]]'', sometimes referred to as a [[throne]], set aside in the sanctuary for the exclusive use of its Ordinary; it symbolizes his spiritual and ecclesiastical authority.\n\n== Additional titles, status and roles ==\n{{Main|Catholic Church hierarchy}}\n\nBishops may fill additional roles in the Catholic Church, including the following:\n\n=== Bishop-elect ===\nA bishop who has been appointed, but has not yet been consecrated. (Consecration is the ceremony formally elevating the bishop-elect to his new rank.)\n\n=== Titular bishop ===\nA [[titular bishop]] (or titular archbishop) is a bishop who is not bishop of a diocese; unless (since 1970) he is coadjutor or emeritus, he is assigned to a [[titular see]], which is usually the name of a city or area that used to be the seat of a diocese, but whose episcopal see (diocese) is no longer functioning as such. Titular bishops often serve as [[auxiliary bishop]]s, as officials in the [[Roman Curia]], in the Patriarchal Curias of Eastern Churches, as papal diplomatic envoys (notably [[apostolic nuncio]]s or [[apostolic delegate]]s), or head certain missionary pre-diocesan jurisdictions (notably as [[apostolic vicar]]). Since 1970, a coadjutor bishop (or archbishop) uses the title of the see he is assigned to, and a bishop (or archbishop) emeritus uses the title of his last residential see.\n\n=== Suffragan bishop ===\nA [[suffragan bishop]] leads a diocese within an [[ecclesiastical province]] other than the principal diocese, the [[metropolitan bishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan archdiocese]].<ref name=\"metropolitan\">{{cite encyclopedia| title=Metropolitan | encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia| pages=244\u201345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmoQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA244#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=2009-12-06|volume=Volume 10|year=1911|publisher=The Encyclopedia Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Auxiliary bishop ===\nAn [[auxiliary bishop]] is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop. Auxiliaries are titular bishops without the right of succession, who assist the diocesan bishop in a variety of ways and are usually appointed as [[vicar general|vicars general or episcopal vicars]] of the diocese in which they serve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM|title=Canons 403.1, 406|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Coadjutor bishop ===\nA [[coadjutor bishop]] is a bishop who is given almost equal authority to that of the diocesan bishop; he has special faculties and the right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1E.HTM|title=Canon 403.3|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> The appointment of coadjutors is seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.  Until recent times, there was the possibility of a coadjutor bishop not having the right of succession.\n\n=== Bishop-prelate ===\nA bishop who is consecrated as such, but holds an office that as such does not require episcopal rank (so the incumbent will not be made a titular bishop), just that of [[Prelate]], notably as [[Territorial prelate]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Emeritus}} Emeritus bishop ===\nWhen a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, he is given the honorary title of \"[[emeritus]]\" of the last see he served, i.e., archbishop emeritus, bishop emeritus, or auxiliary bishop emeritus of the see. \"Emeritus\" is not used for a titular see. Examples: Archbishop (or Bishop) Emeritus of Place\".\n\nTraditionally, bishops appointed ordinaries or auxiliaries served for life. When the rare resignation occurred, the bishop was assigned a titular see. The status of \"emeritus\" emerged after the [[Second Vatican Council]] when bishops were at first encouraged and then required to submit their resignations at the age of 75. On 31 October 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed that \"diocesan bishops of the Latin rite who resign are no longer transferred to a titular church, but instead continue to be identified by the name of the see they have resigned.\"<ref>{{cite news | work= [[America (magazine)|America]] | accessdate = 17 October 2018 | date= 22 March 2010 | url = https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/730/article/bishop-emeritus | title = The Bishop Emeritus: Resigned but still ministering | first = Frank J. | last = Rodimer }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | language = it | publisher =Libreria Editrice Vaticana| author = Congregation for Bishops | date= 2008 | title = Il vescovo emerito |isbn=8820980479}}</ref><ref>{{cite document | language = it | url = http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2004-03/31-13/ComRenun.pdf | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170325112759/http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2004-03/31-13/ComRenun.pdf | title = Communicazione del titolo dei Vescovi 'officio renuntiantibus' | archive-date= 25 March 2017 |accessdate = 17 October 2018 | website = Congregation for the Clergy| author-link= Carlo Confalonieri | first =Carlo |last= Confaloneri}}</ref>\n\n=== Cardinal ===\nA [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] is a member of the clergy appointed by the Pope to serve in the [[College of Cardinals]]. Members of the College aged under 80 elect a new pope, who is in practice always one of their number, on the death or resignation of the incumbent. Cardinals also serve as papal advisors and hold positions of authority within the structure of the Catholic Church. Under canon law, a man appointed a cardinal must normally be a bishop, or accept consecration as a bishop, but may seek papal permission to decline. Most cardinals are already bishops when appointed, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchates, others already serving as titular bishops in the Roman Curia. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them renowned theologians, to the College of Cardinals, and these have been permitted to decline episcopal consecration. Examples include [[Karl Josef Becker|Karl Becker]] in 2012 and [[Ernest Simoni]] in 2016.\n\n=== Titles and functions reserved for archbishops ===\n{{Main|Archbishop}}\n\n==== Pope ====\nThe [[pope]] is the man who possesses the sacrament of Holy Orders as a bishop and who has been chosen to be Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The Catholic Church holds that the College of Bishops as a group is the successor of the College of Apostles. The Church also holds that uniquely among the [[apostles]] [[Saint Peter]] was granted a role of leadership and authority, giving the pope the right to govern the Church together with the bishops, and making his leadership necessary for the completion of the College.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |title=Lumen Gentium 18 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |archivedate=6 September 2014 |df= }}</ref> Hence, Catholicism holds that the Bishop of Rome, as successor of Peter, possesses this role: the pope, uniquely among bishops, may speak for the whole Church, and a council of bishops is incomplete without the approval of the pope. Papal pronouncements which meet the requirements of the decree on [[papal infallibility]] of the [[First Vatican Council]], and no others, even in matters of faith and morals, are deemed to be infallible. Papal infallibility has been invoked only twice since the doctrine was instituted and both are about Mary: her Immaculate Conception (declared by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and grandfathered in after the First Vatican Council's declaration of papal infallibility in 1870) and her bodily Assumption into heaven (declared by Pope Pius XII in 1950).\n\n==== Pope emeritus ====\nOn [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|his resignation as pope]] (Bishop of Rome), Benedict XVI became ''[[Pope Benedict XVI#Pope Emeritus|His Holiness Benedict XVI, Supreme Pontiff Emeritus]]'' or ''Pope Emeritus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350523?eng=y|title=Vatican Diary / The identity cards of the last two popes|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Patriarch and Catholicos ====\n[[Catholicos]] is an Eastern title roughly similar to that of patriarch. In the Catholic Church it is applied to a prelate who is also a major archbishop.\n\n==== Major archbishop ====\n[[Major archbishop]]s are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. The major archbishops' authority within their respective ''sui juris'' churches is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honours.\n\n==== Primate ====\nIn the Catholic, [[Anglican Church|Anglican]], and some other Churches a [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] is usually the bishop of the oldest diocese and/or the capital of a (present or former) [[nation]]; the title is one of honor.\n\n==== Metropolitan archbishop ====\nA [[metropolitan bishop]] is an archbishop with minor jurisdiction over an [[ecclesiastical province]]; in practice this amounts to presiding at meetings and overseeing a diocese which has no bishop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canon 435-36|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1J.HTM | publisher= Libreria Editrice Vaticana | work= [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]] | accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>\n \nIn Eastern Catholicism a metropolitan may also be the head of an [[autocephalous]], ''[[sui juris]]'', or [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] church when the number of adherents of that tradition is small. In the Latin Church, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is \"Metropolitan,\" with some of these churches using \"archbishop\" as a separate office.\n\n=== Public office ===\nSince the publication of the new [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]], all members of the Catholic clergy are forbidden to hold public office without the express permission of the [[Holy See]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM|title=Canon 285.3|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Consecration of bishops and eparchs ==\n{{Main|Appointment of Catholic bishops}}\n{{See also|Consecrator}}\nThe appointment of bishops in the Catholic Church is a complicated process that requires the participation of several officials. In the Latin Church, the local synod, the papal nuncio (or apostolic delegate), various [[dicastery|dicasteries]] of the Roman Curia, and the Pope all take a part; since the 1970s it has become common practice for the nuncio to solicit input from clergy and laity within the vacant diocese.  In patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Eastern Churches, the permanent synod, the holy synod, and the patriarch or major archbishop also play a role in the selection of bishops.\n\n== Apostolic succession and other churches ==\n{{Main|Apostolic succession}}\n\nThe Catholic Church has always taught that bishops are descended from a continuous line of bishops since the days of the [[apostles]], which is known as [[apostolic succession]]. Since 1896, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued the bull ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'', the [[Catholic Church]] has not recognised [[Anglican]] orders as valid, because of changes in the ordination rites that took place in the 16th century as well as divergence in the understanding of the theology of episcopacy and Eucharist. However, this view has since been complicated because [[Old Catholic]] bishops, whose orders are fully recognised as valid by Rome, have acted as co-consecrators in Anglican episcopal consecrations. According to the church historian Timothy Dufort, by 1969 all [[Church of England]] bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of [[apostolic succession]] fully recognised by the Holy See.<ref>Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', May 29, 1982, pp. 536\u2013538.</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church does recognize, as [[valid but illicit]], ordinations done by breakaway Catholic groups such as the [[Old Catholic Church]] of the [[Utrecht Union]] and the [[Polish National Catholic Church]], so long as those receiving the ordination are baptized males and a valid rite of episcopal consecration\u2014expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop\u2014is used. The Holy See also recognises as valid the ordinations of the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Old Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Nestorian]] churches. Regarding the Churches of the East, the [[Second Vatican Council]] stated:\n\n{{quote|To remove, then, all shadow of doubt, this holy Council solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while remembering the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to the disciplines proper to them, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful, and more for the good of their souls.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |title=Decree on Ecumenism/Unitatis Redintegratio 16 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df= }}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the Holy See does not recognise as valid the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with core tenets of Christianity even though it may use the proper ritual. The recent practice of Independent Catholic groups to [[Ordination of women|ordain women]] has added a definite cloudiness to the recognition of the validity of orders, as the act of ordaining women as priests or bishops is incompatible with Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. The practice by some independent clergy of receiving multiple ordinations also demonstrates an understanding of Holy Orders which is at variance with Catholicism and Orthodoxy, both of which hold that a person is either ordained or not.\n\n== Dress and vestments ==\n{{Main|Pontifical vestments}}v\n\n=== Latin Church ===\n\nThe everyday dress of Latin Church bishops may consist of a black (or, in tropical countries, white) [[cassock]] with [[Amaranth (color)|\namaranth]] trim and purple [[Fascia (vestment)|fascia]], along with a [[pectoral cross]] and [[episcopal ring]]. The 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that the dress for ordinary use may instead be a simple cassock without coloured trim.<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates, 28 March 1969], 14</ref> Since 1969, a black suit and clerical shirt, already customary in English-speaking countries, has become very common also in countries where previously it was unknown.\n\nA Latin Church bishop's [[choir dress]], which is worn when attending but not celebrating liturgical functions, consists of the purple [[cassock]] with amaranth trim, [[rochet]], purple [[zuchetto]], purple [[biretta]] with a tuft, and [[pectoral cross]]. The [[cappa magna]] may be worn, but only within the bishop's own diocese and on especially solemn occasions.<ref>''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 64</ref>\n\nThe [[mitre]], [[zuchetto]], and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the bishop typically wears the [[cope]]. Within his own [[diocese]] and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]], he also uses the [[crosier]].<ref>''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 59</ref> When celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a bishop, like a [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], wears the [[chasuble]]. The [[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]] recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a [[dalmatic]], which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of [[holy orders]], blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.<ref>''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 56</ref> The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of [[pontifical gloves]], [[pontifical sandals]], [[liturgical stockings]] (also known as [[buskins]]), the [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]], or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop's horse.\n\n=== Eastern Catholic ===\nThe everyday dress of Eastern Catholic bishops is often the same as their Latin Church counterparts: black clerical suit with pectoral cross or [[panagia]].  When attending liturgical functions at which he does not celebrate, an Eastern Catholic bishop usually wears a [[mantya]], panagia and an [[engolpion]] if he is a [[patriarch]] or [[metropolitan bishop]]. He will also carry a pastoral staff in the form of a walking stick topped by a [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]]. Eastern Catholic bishops do not normally use an episcopal ring.\n\nWhen participating in the [[Divine Liturgy]], an Eastern Catholic bishop will wear the  [[sakkos]] (Imperial [[dalmatic]]), [[omophorion]], [[epigonation]] and Eastern-style mitre. The most typical mitre in the Eastern Catholic churches is based on the closed Imperial crown of the late [[Byzantine Empire]].  It is made in the shape of a bulbous crown, completely enclosed, and the material is of [[brocade]], [[damask]] or [[cloth of gold]]. It may be embroidered, and richly decorated with jewels. There are normally four [[icons]] attached to the mitre: ([[Christ]], the [[Theotokos]], [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Cross]]. Eastern mitres are usually gold, but other [[liturgical colours]] may be used. The mitre is often topped by a cross, either made out of metal and standing upright, or embroidered in cloth and lying flat on the top. He will also carry a [[crosier]] of the Eastern style.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Apostolic succession]]\n* [[Catholic Church hierarchy]]\n* [[Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States]]\n*[[List of Catholic dioceses (alphabetical)]]\n*[[List of Catholic dioceses (structured view)]]\n*[[List of Catholic archdioceses]]\n*[[Military ordinariate|List of Catholic military dioceses]]\n*[[apostolic administrator|List of Catholic apostolic administrations]]\n*[[Apostolic Vicariate|List of Catholic apostolic vicariates]]\n*[[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|List of Eastern Catholic exarchates]]\n*[[Apostolic prefect|List of Catholic apostolic prefectures]]\n*[[Territorial prelate|List of Catholic territorial prelatures]]\n*[[Mission sui iuris|List of Catholic missions ''sui juris'']]\n*[[List of the Catholic bishops of the United States]]\n*[[List of the Catholic dioceses of the United States]]\n*[[Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|bishop|episcopal|episcopus}}\n*[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/ List of Catholic bishops worldwide]\n\n{{Catholicism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Episcopacy in the Catholic Church| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the role of bishops in the Catholic Church|information on the historical origin of the office|Bishop}}\n{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}\n[[File:Bischof-GL-M\u00fcller.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Latin Church]] Catholic bishop [[Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller]] wearing the [[pontifical vestments]] and carrying a [[crosier]].]]\n[[File:Kanjirappally Bishop Mar Mathew Arackal at Tomb of Mar Varghese Payyappilly Palakkappilly.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Eastern Catholic bishop of the [[Syro-Malabar]] Church holding the Mar Thoma Cross which symbolizes the heritage and identity of the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Church]] of [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[Christianity in India|India]]]]\n[[File:Johann Otto von Gemmingen.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Johann Otto von Gemmingen]], [[Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg|Prince-Bishop of Augsburg in Bavaria]], 1591\u20131598, carrying a [[crosier]] and wearing a\n[[mitre]] and [[pluviale]].]]\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], a '''bishop''' is an [[Holy Orders|ordained]] [[Minister (Catholic Church)|minister]] who holds the fullness of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[holy orders (Catholic Church)|holy orders]] and is responsible for teaching doctrine,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm#888 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church \u2013 Christ's Faithful \u2013 Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1946-02-20 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> governing Catholics in his jurisdiction,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm#894 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church \u2013 Christ's Faithful \u2013 Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1946-02-20 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> sanctifying the world<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm#893 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church \u2013 Christ's Faithful \u2013 Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1946-02-20 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> and representing the Church.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm#1553 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church \u2013 The sacrament of Holy Orders |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424192537/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm#1553 |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p3.htm#832 |title=CCC \u2013 PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 9 PARAGRAPH 3 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1975-12-14 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> Catholics trace the origins of the office of [[bishop]] to the [[apostles]], who it is believed were endowed with a special [[charism]] by the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#III|title=Catechism 1556|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Catholics believe this special charism has been transmitted through an [[apostolic succession|unbroken succession of bishops]] by the [[laying on of hands]] in the sacrament of holy orders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#III|title=Catechism 1555\u20131556|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Diocesan bishop]]s\u2014known as [[eparch]]s in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]\u2014are assigned to govern local regions within the Catholic Church known as [[diocese]]s in the [[Latin Church]] and [[Eparchy|eparchies]] in the Eastern Churches.

In order to offer Mass or Divine Liturgy publicly, however, a priest is required to have permission from the local Ordinary\u2014authority for this permission may be given to pastors of parishes for a limited period, but for long-term permission recourse to the diocesan bishop is usually required. A [[celebret]] may be issued to travelling priests so that they can demonstrate to pastors and bishops outside of their own diocese that they are in good standing.

In the Eastern tradition, the clergy not only witness the exchange of vows but must impart a blessing for a valid marriage to have taken place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a7.htm#II|title=Catechism of Catholic Church para 1623|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nUnless a particular bishop has forbidden it, any bishop may preach throughout the Catholic Church<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2I.HTM|title=Canon 763|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> and any priest or deacon may also preach anywhere (presuming the permission of local pastor) unless his faculty to preach has been restricted or removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2I.HTM|title=Canon 764|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[cathedral]] of a diocese contains a special chair, called a ''[[cathedra]]'', sometimes referred to as a [[throne]], set aside in the sanctuary for the exclusive use of its Ordinary; it symbolizes his spiritual and ecclesiastical authority.\n\n== Additional titles, status and roles ==\n{{Main|Catholic Church hierarchy}}\n\nBishops may fill additional roles in the Catholic Church, including the following:\n\n=== Bishop-elect ===\nA bishop who has been appointed, but has not yet been consecrated. (Consecration is the ceremony formally elevating the bishop-elect to his new rank.)\n\n=== Titular bishop ===\nA [[titular bishop]] (or titular archbishop) is a bishop who is not bishop of a diocese; unless (since 1970) he is coadjutor or emeritus, he is assigned to a [[titular see]], which is usually the name of a city or area that used to be the seat of a diocese, but whose episcopal see (diocese) is no longer functioning as such. Titular bishops often serve as [[auxiliary bishop]]s, as officials in the [[Roman Curia]], in the Patriarchal Curias of Eastern Churches, as papal diplomatic envoys (notably [[apostolic nuncio]]s or [[apostolic delegate]]s), or head certain missionary pre-diocesan jurisdictions (notably as [[apostolic vicar]]). Since 1970, a coadjutor bishop (or archbishop) uses the title of the see he is assigned to, and a bishop (or archbishop) emeritus uses the title of his last residential see.\n\n=== Suffragan bishop ===\nA [[suffragan bishop]] leads a diocese within an [[ecclesiastical province]] other than the principal diocese, the [[metropolitan bishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan archdiocese]].<ref name=\"metropolitan\">{{cite encyclopedia| title=Metropolitan | encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia| pages=244\u201345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmoQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA244#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=2009-12-06|volume=Volume 10|year=1911|publisher=The Encyclopedia Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Auxiliary bishop ===\nAn [[auxiliary bishop]] is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop. Auxiliaries are titular bishops without the right of succession, who assist the diocesan bishop in a variety of ways and are usually appointed as [[vicar general|vicars general or episcopal vicars]] of the diocese in which they serve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM|title=Canons 403.1, 406|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Coadjutor bishop ===\nA [[coadjutor bishop]] is a bishop who is given almost equal authority to that of the diocesan bishop; he has special faculties and the right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1E.HTM|title=Canon 403.3|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> The appointment of coadjutors is seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.  Until recent times, there was the possibility of a coadjutor bishop not having the right of succession.\n\n=== Bishop-prelate ===\nA bishop who is consecrated as such, but holds an office that as such does not require episcopal rank (so the incumbent will not be made a titular bishop), just that of [[Prelate]], notably as [[Territorial prelate]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Emeritus}} Emeritus bishop ===\nWhen a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, he is given the honorary title of \"[[emeritus]]\" of the last see he served, i.e., archbishop emeritus, bishop emeritus, or auxiliary bishop emeritus of the see. \"Emeritus\" is not used for a titular see. Examples: Archbishop (or Bishop) Emeritus of Place\".\n\nTraditionally, bishops appointed ordinaries or auxiliaries served for life. When the rare resignation occurred, the bishop was assigned a titular see. The status of \"emeritus\" emerged after the [[Second Vatican Council]] when bishops were at first encouraged and then required to submit their resignations at the age of 75. On 31 October 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed that \"diocesan bishops of the Latin rite who resign are no longer transferred to a titular church, but instead continue to be identified by the name of the see they have resigned.\"<ref>{{cite news | work= [[America (magazine)|America]] | accessdate = 17 October 2018 | date= 22 March 2010 | url = https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/730/article/bishop-emeritus | title = The Bishop Emeritus: Resigned but still ministering | first = Frank J. | last = Rodimer }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | language = it | publisher =Libreria Editrice Vaticana| author = Congregation for Bishops | date= 2008 | title = Il vescovo emerito |isbn=8820980479}}</ref><ref>{{cite document | language = it | url = http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2004-03/31-13/ComRenun.pdf | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170325112759/http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2004-03/31-13/ComRenun.pdf | title = Communicazione del titolo dei Vescovi 'officio renuntiantibus' | archive-date= 25 March 2017 |accessdate = 17 October 2018 | website = Congregation for the Clergy| author-link= Carlo Confalonieri | first =Carlo |last= Confaloneri}}</ref>\n\n=== Cardinal ===\nA [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] is a member of the clergy appointed by the Pope to serve in the [[College of Cardinals]]. Members of the College aged under 80 elect a new pope, who is in practice always one of their number, on the death or resignation of the incumbent. Cardinals also serve as papal advisors and hold positions of authority within the structure of the Catholic Church. Under canon law, a man appointed a cardinal must normally be a bishop, or accept consecration as a bishop, but may seek papal permission to decline. Most cardinals are already bishops when appointed, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchates, others already serving as titular bishops in the Roman Curia. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them renowned theologians, to the College of Cardinals, and these have been permitted to decline episcopal consecration. Examples include [[Karl Josef Becker|Karl Becker]] in 2012 and [[Ernest Simoni]] in 2016.\n\n=== Titles and functions reserved for archbishops ===\n{{Main|Archbishop}}\n\n==== Pope ====\nThe [[pope]] is the man who possesses the sacrament of Holy Orders as a bishop and who has been chosen to be Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The Catholic Church holds that the College of Bishops as a group is the successor of the College of Apostles. The Church also holds that uniquely among the [[apostles]] [[Saint Peter]] was granted a role of leadership and authority, giving the pope the right to govern the Church together with the bishops, and making his leadership necessary for the completion of the College.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |title=Lumen Gentium 18 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |archivedate=6 September 2014 |df= }}</ref> Hence, Catholicism holds that the Bishop of Rome, as successor of Peter, possesses this role: the pope, uniquely among bishops, may speak for the whole Church, and a council of bishops is incomplete without the approval of the pope. Papal pronouncements which meet the requirements of the decree on [[papal infallibility]] of the [[First Vatican Council]], and no others, even in matters of faith and morals, are deemed to be infallible. Papal infallibility has been invoked only twice since the doctrine was instituted and both are about Mary: her Immaculate Conception (declared by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and grandfathered in after the First Vatican Council's declaration of papal infallibility in 1870) and her bodily Assumption into heaven (declared by Pope Pius XII in 1950).\n\n==== Pope emeritus ====\nOn [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|his resignation as pope]] (Bishop of Rome), Benedict XVI became ''[[Pope Benedict XVI#Pope Emeritus|His Holiness Benedict XVI, Supreme Pontiff Emeritus]]'' or ''Pope Emeritus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350523?eng=y|title=Vatican Diary / The identity cards of the last two popes|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Patriarch and Catholicos ====\n[[Catholicos]] is an Eastern title roughly similar to that of patriarch. In the Catholic Church it is applied to a prelate who is also a major archbishop.\n\n==== Major archbishop ====\n[[Major archbishop]]s are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. The major archbishops' authority within their respective ''sui juris'' churches is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honours.\n\n==== Primate ====\nIn the Catholic, [[Anglican Church|Anglican]], and some other Churches a [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] is usually the bishop of the oldest diocese and/or the capital of a (present or former) [[nation]]; the title is one of honor.\n\n==== Metropolitan archbishop ====\nA [[metropolitan bishop]] is an archbishop with minor jurisdiction over an [[ecclesiastical province]]; in practice this amounts to presiding at meetings and overseeing a diocese which has no bishop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canon 435-36|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1J.HTM | publisher= Libreria Editrice Vaticana | work= [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]] | accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>\n \nIn Eastern Catholicism a metropolitan may also be the head of an [[autocephalous]], ''[[sui juris]]'', or [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] church when the number of adherents of that tradition is small. In the Latin Church, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is \"Metropolitan,\" with some of these churches using \"archbishop\" as a separate office.\n\n=== Public office ===\nSince the publication of the new [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] in 1983 by [[Pope John Paul II]], all members of the Catholic clergy are forbidden to hold public office without the express permission of the [[Holy See]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM|title=Canon 285.3|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Consecration of bishops and eparchs ==\n{{Main|Appointment of Catholic bishops}}\n{{See also|Consecrator}}\nThe appointment of bishops in the Catholic Church is a complicated process that requires the participation of several officials. In the Latin Church, the local synod, the papal nuncio (or apostolic delegate), various [[dicastery|dicasteries]] of the Roman Curia, and the Pope all take a part; since the 1970s it has become common practice for the nuncio to solicit input from clergy and laity within the vacant diocese.  In patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Eastern Churches, the permanent synod, the holy synod, and the patriarch or major archbishop also play a role in the selection of bishops.\n\n== Apostolic succession and other churches ==\n{{Main|Apostolic succession}}\n\nThe Catholic Church has always taught that bishops are descended from a continuous line of bishops since the days of the [[apostles]], which is known as [[apostolic succession]]. Since 1896, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued the bull ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'', the [[Catholic Church]] has not recognised [[Anglican]] orders as valid, because of changes in the ordination rites that took place in the 16th century as well as divergence in the understanding of the theology of episcopacy and Eucharist. However, this view has since been complicated because [[Old Catholic]] bishops, whose orders are fully recognised as valid by Rome, have acted as co-consecrators in Anglican episcopal consecrations. According to the church historian Timothy Dufort, by 1969 all [[Church of England]] bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of [[apostolic succession]] fully recognised by the Holy See.<ref>Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', May 29, 1982, pp. 536\u2013538.</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church does recognize, as [[valid but illicit]], ordinations done by breakaway Catholic groups such as the [[Old Catholic Church]] of the [[Utrecht Union]] and the [[Polish National Catholic Church]], so long as those receiving the ordination are baptized males and a valid rite of episcopal consecration\u2014expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop\u2014is used. The Holy See also recognises as valid the ordinations of the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Old Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Nestorian]] churches. Regarding the Churches of the East, the [[Second Vatican Council]] stated:\n\n{{quote|To remove, then, all shadow of doubt, this holy Council solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while remembering the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to the disciplines proper to them, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful, and more for the good of their souls.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |title=Decree on Ecumenism/Unitatis Redintegratio 16 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df= }}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the Holy See does not recognise as valid the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with core tenets of Christianity even though it may use the proper ritual. The recent practice of Independent Catholic groups to [[Ordination of women|ordain women]] has added a definite cloudiness to the recognition of the validity of orders, as the act of ordaining women as priests or bishops is incompatible with Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. The practice by some independent clergy of receiving multiple ordinations also demonstrates an understanding of Holy Orders which is at variance with Catholicism and Orthodoxy, both of which hold that a person is either ordained or not.\n\n== Dress and vestments ==\n{{Main|Pontifical vestments}}\n\n=== Latin Church ===\n\nThe everyday dress of Latin Church bishops may consist of a black (or, in tropical countries, white) [[cassock]] with [[Amaranth (color)|\namaranth]] trim and purple [[Fascia (vestment)|fascia]], along with a [[pectoral cross]] and [[episcopal ring]]. The 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that the dress for ordinary use may instead be a simple cassock without coloured trim.<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates, 28 March 1969], 14</ref> Since 1969, a black suit and clerical shirt, already customary in English-speaking countries, has become very common also in countries where previously it was unknown.\n\nA Latin Church bishop's [[choir dress]], which is worn when attending but not celebrating liturgical functions, consists of the purple [[cassock]] with amaranth trim, [[rochet]], purple [[zuchetto]], purple [[biretta]] with a tuft, and [[pectoral cross]]. The [[cappa magna]] may be worn, but only within the bishop's own diocese and on especially solemn occasions.<ref>''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 64</ref>\n\nThe [[mitre]], [[zuchetto]], and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the bishop typically wears the [[cope]]. Within his own [[diocese]] and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]], he also uses the [[crosier]].<ref>''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 59</ref> When celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a bishop, like a [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], wears the [[chasuble]]. The [[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]] recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a [[dalmatic]], which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of [[holy orders]], blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.<ref>''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 56</ref> The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of [[pontifical gloves]], [[pontifical sandals]], [[liturgical stockings]] (also known as [[buskins]]), the [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]], or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop's horse.\n\n=== Eastern Catholic ===\nThe everyday dress of Eastern Catholic bishops is often the same as their Latin Church counterparts: black clerical suit with pectoral cross or [[panagia]].  When attending liturgical functions at which he does not celebrate, an Eastern Catholic bishop usually wears a [[mantya]], panagia and an [[engolpion]] if he is a [[patriarch]] or [[metropolitan bishop]]. He will also carry a pastoral staff in the form of a walking stick topped by a [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]]. Eastern Catholic bishops do not normally use an episcopal ring.\n\nWhen participating in the [[Divine Liturgy]], an Eastern Catholic bishop will wear the  [[sakkos]] (Imperial [[dalmatic]]), [[omophorion]], [[epigonation]] and Eastern-style mitre. The most typical mitre in the Eastern Catholic churches is based on the closed Imperial crown of the late [[Byzantine Empire]].  It is made in the shape of a bulbous crown, completely enclosed, and the material is of [[brocade]], [[damask]] or [[cloth of gold]]. It may be embroidered, and richly decorated with jewels. There are normally four [[icons]] attached to the mitre: ([[Christ]], the [[Theotokos]], [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Cross]].
