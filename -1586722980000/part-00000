Lead guitarist Richie Sambora, however, convinced him the song was good, and they reworked it with a new bassline (recorded by [[Hugh McDonald (American musician)|Hugh McDonald]] uncredited <ref name=\"On Bass: The Song Guys\">{{cite web|last1=Brod\u00e9n|first1=Victor|title=On Bass: The Song Guys|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/21155-on-bass-the-song-guys|website=Premier Guitar|accessdate=March 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{cite web|last1=Setaro|first1=Shawn|title=Inside The Business Of Bon Jovi With Bryan Reesman|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shawnsetaro/2016/10/26/business-bon-jovi-bryan-reesman/#21f9a6ea381b|website=Forbes|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=McDonald |first1=Hugh |title=Hugh McDonald Official Website \u2013 Discography |url=http://www.huey-mcdonald.com/discography.php |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302012105/http://www.huey-mcdonald.com/discography.php |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}</ref>), different drum fills and the use of a [[talk box]] to include it on ''Slippery When Wet''. The song spent two weeks at number one on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]], from January 31 to February 14, 1987, and four weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, from February 14 to March 14. It also hit number four on the [[UK singles chart]].\n\nThe album version of the song, timed around 4:10, fades out at the end. However, the music video game ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' features the song's original studio ending, where the band revisit the intro riff and end with a talk box solo; this version ends at 4:53. The original ending is also playable on the similar video game ''[[Rock Band 2]]'', though edited in this case (thereby eliminating the talk box solo at the end). The version included on the 2005 [[DualDisc]] edition of ''Slippery When Wet'' has an extended version of the original ending, with a different talk box solo playing over the riff (possibly taken from an outtake of the song); this version, which fades out at the end like the standard version of the song, ends at 5:06.\n\nAfter the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] \u2013 in which [[New Jersey]] was the second-hardest hit state after [[New York (state)|New York]], suffering hundreds of casualties among both [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|WTC]] workers and [[first responders]] \u2013 the band performed an acoustic version of this song for New York.

It was also No. 1 on the \"Sing-a-long Classics List\".

Tommy loses his job as a dockworker due to a strike while Gina works as a diner waitress. The storyline was inspired by real-life events that Jon Bon Jovi and songwriter Desmond Child experienced in the 1970's. Jon Bon Jovi had an acquaintance who was a star baseball player in his school and wanted to be a professional baseball player only for his girlfriend to inform him of her pregnancy wherein he gave up the ambition and took up a job in a factory. Desmond Child was a taxi driver in New York while his then-girlfriend, singer-songwriter [[Maria Vidal]], worked as a waitress in a diner named \"Once Upon A Stove\", similar to Gina in the song. The owner, manager, and other employees of the diner called Vidal as Gina due to her slight physical resemblance to Italian actress and photographer [[Gina Lollobrigida]].\n\n\"It deals with the way that two kids \u2013 Tommy and Gina \u2013 face life's struggles,\" noted Bon Jovi, \"and how their love and ambitions get them through the hard times.

The song spent two weeks at number one on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]], from January 31 to February 14, 1987, and four weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, from February 14 to March 14. It also hit number four on the [[UK singles chart]].\n\nThe album version of the song, timed around 4:10, fades out at the end. However, the music video game ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' features the song's original studio ending, where the band revisit the intro riff and end with a talk box solo; this version ends at 4:53. The original ending is also playable on the similar video game ''[[Rock Band 2]]'', though edited in this case (thereby eliminating the talk box solo at the end). The version included on the 2005 [[DualDisc]] edition of ''Slippery When Wet'' has an extended version of the original ending, with a different talk box solo playing over the riff (possibly taken from an outtake of the song); this version, which fades out at the end like the standard version of the song, ends at 5:06.\n\nAfter the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] \u2013 in which [[New Jersey]] was the second-hardest hit state after [[New York (state)|New York]], suffering hundreds of casualties among both [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|WTC]] workers and [[first responders]] \u2013 the band performed an acoustic version of this song for New York.

It was also No. 1 on the \"Sing-a-long Classics List\".

Tommy loses his job as a dockworker due to a strike while Gina works as a diner waitress. The storyline was inspired by real-life events that Jon Bon Jovi and songwriter Desmond Child experienced in the 1970's. Jon Bon Jovi had an acquaintance who was a star baseball player in his school and wanted to be a professional baseball player only for his girlfriend to inform him of her pregnancy wherein he gave up the ambition and took up a job in a factory. Desmond Child was a taxi driver in New York while his then-girlfriend, singer-songwriter [[Maria Vidal]], worked as a waitress in a diner named \"Once Upon A Stove\", similar to Gina in the song. The owner, manager, and other employees of the diner called Vidal as Gina due to her slight physical resemblance to Italian actress and photographer [[Gina Lollobrigida]].\n\n\"It deals with the way that two kids \u2013 Tommy and Gina \u2013 face life's struggles,\" noted Bon Jovi, \"and how their love and ambitions get them through the hard times.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978\u201379 season.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Badges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872\u20132012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Gersnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261&Itemid=326|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Gersnet Online|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=From 1990 to 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto were placed above and below the Crest respectively.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

He spun in turn four, was hit by another car, and went over the outside wall. One of his errant wheels bounced across Georgetown Road, and struck and killed a 12-year-old boy, Wilbur C. Brink.

Coming out of turn four, Fittipaldi's left wheels touched the rumble strips on the inside, causing the left side tires to lose adhesion, and the rear of the car to swing wide at the turn exit, resulting in the rear tagging the outside wall and knocking Fittipaldi out of the race. Unser, Jr. went on to win.\n*[[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]]: [[Tomas Scheckter]] - After leading 85 laps during the race, the rookie was leading on lap 173. Coming out of turn 4, he slid high and smacked the outside wall down the frontstretch.\n*[[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]]: [[J. R. Hildebrand]] - During the final ten laps, a sequence of green flag pit stops shuffled the field. Rookie [[J. R. Hildebrand]] was attempting to stretch his fuel to the finish, and took over the lead with just over two laps to go. On the final lap, he was leading going into the final turn, when he came up on the lapped car of [[Charlie Kimball]], who was slowing to the inside. Hildebrand went high, got into the \"marbles,\" and smacked the outside wall. Without steering, and only on three wheels, his car slid down the frontstretch towards the finish line and the checkered flag. However, Hildebrand was passed by [[Dan Wheldon]] on the final 1,000 feet and Hildebrand finished second.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Indy 500}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indianapolis 500 Records}}\n[[Category:Indianapolis 500-related lists|Records]]\n[[Category:Auto racing records]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2011}}\n''As of [[2019 Indianapolis 500|103rd race]], May 26, 2019.''\n\n==Race records==\n\n===Victories===\n\n====Quantity====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background:#F2F2F2;\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"6\"|'''Most driver victories'''\n|-\n!'''Wins'''\n!'''Driver'''\n|style=\"background:#F2F2F2;\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\"|'''Years'''\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F2F2F2;\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|'''4'''\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[A.

He spun in turn four, was hit by another car, and went over the outside wall. One of his errant wheels bounced across Georgetown Road, and struck and killed a 12-year-old boy, Wilbur C. Brink.

Coming out of turn four, Fittipaldi's left wheels touched the rumble strips on the inside, causing the left side tires to lose adhesion, and the rear of the car to swing wide at the turn exit, resulting in the rear tagging the outside wall and knocking Fittipaldi out of the race. Unser, Jr. went on to win.\n*[[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]]: [[Tomas Scheckter]] - After leading 85 laps during the race, the rookie was leading on lap 173. Coming out of turn 4, he slid high and smacked the outside wall down the frontstretch.\n*[[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]]: [[J. R. Hildebrand]] - During the final ten laps, a sequence of green flag pit stops shuffled the field. Rookie [[J. R. Hildebrand]] was attempting to stretch his fuel to the finish, and took over the lead with just over two laps to go. On the final lap, he was leading going into the final turn, when he came up on the lapped car of [[Charlie Kimball]], who was slowing to the inside. Hildebrand went high, got into the \"marbles,\" and smacked the outside wall. Without steering, and only on three wheels, his car slid down the frontstretch towards the finish line and the checkered flag. However, Hildebrand was passed by [[Dan Wheldon]] on the final 1,000 feet and Hildebrand finished second.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Indy 500}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indianapolis 500 Records}}\n[[Category:Indianapolis 500-related lists|Records]]\n[[Category:Auto racing records]]\n", "name_user": "2.27.59.66", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "({{Redirect|List of Indy 500 records}} Line 1)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500_records"}

The series premiered on September 14, 2003, on HBO and finished its two-season run of 24 episodes on March 27, 2005. Until late in the second season, each episode is split into two distinct but slowly converging storylines taking place in the United States [[Dustbowl]] of the mid-1930s. [[Nick Stahl]] starred as [[Ben Hawkins (Carniv\u00e0le)|Ben Hawkins]], a young [[Okie]] farmer with strange powers who joins a [[traveling carnival]]; [[Clancy Brown]] played his adversary [[Brother Justin Crowe]], a [[California]] preacher who uses his similarly strange abilities to rise to power. ''Carniv\u00e0le'' was originally intended to run as a trilogy of paired seasons, with each pair being called a \"book\" and the series as a whole spanning the years from 1934 to 1945, but the series was canceled after two seasons due to low ratings. These two seasons complete the first book covering the years 1934 and 1935. The second book (seasons three and four) would have taken place around the years 1939 and 1940, and the third book (seasons five and six) would have played in 1944 and 1945, leading up to the end of [[World War II]] and the explosion at the [[Trinity test]] site.<ref name=jimmy>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmy.fr/series/carnival/interview.html |title=Interview de Daniel Knauf |publisher=Jimmy.fr |language=French |date=April 2005 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010161641/http://www.jimmy.fr/series/carnival/interview.html |archivedate=October 10, 2007}}</ref><ref name=carnycon2006>\n[[Daniel Knauf]] at Carny Con 2006.

As Justin and Iris mount the Ferris wheel for a long ride, Ben begins to perform a mass-healing act as Benjamin St. John. After crumbling in pain and ripping his shirt open for everyone to see, Justin stops the Ferris wheel and enters Ben's tent. He pulls out the sickle that already killed Scudder, lacerates several devotees and Norman standing in his way, and pursues Ben into a cornfield. Justin cuts Ben on the arm and abdomen, and Ben's blade breaks apart. With Justin towering over him ready to carry out his last task, Ben remembers Management's words, grabs his broken blade and plunges it deep into Justin's tattooed chest where the branches meet. Meanwhile, Jonesy has tracked Stroud to Sofie's place, overpowers him and releases her, but Sofie shoots Jonesy down. The next morning, the carnies find Brother Justin with Emma's blade in his chest and bring Ben, still breathing, back to their camp. Stumpy and Rita Sue, whose outstanding debts are now covered by Iris's honorarium, reassure Libby that Jonesy will soon return. In the meantime, Sofie approaches Justin and places her hands on his chest.

The series premiered on September 14, 2003, on HBO and finished its two-season run of 24 episodes on March 27, 2005. Until late in the second season, each episode is split into two distinct but slowly converging storylines taking place in the United States [[Dustbowl]] of the mid-1930s. [[Nick Stahl]] starred as [[Ben Hawkins (Carniv\u00e0le)|Ben Hawkins]], a young [[Okie]] farmer with strange powers who joins a [[traveling carnival]]; [[Clancy Brown]] played his adversary [[Brother Justin Crowe]], a [[California]] preacher who uses his similarly strange abilities to rise to power. ''Carniv\u00e0le'' was originally intended to run as a trilogy of paired seasons, with each pair being called a \"book\" and the series as a whole spanning the years from 1934 to 1945, but the series was canceled after two seasons due to low ratings. These two seasons complete the first book covering the years 1934 and 1935. The second book (seasons three and four) would have taken place around the years 1939 and 1940, and the third book (seasons five and six) would have played in 1944 and 1945, leading up to the end of [[World War II]] and the explosion at the [[Trinity test]] site.<ref name=jimmy>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmy.fr/series/carnival/interview.html |title=Interview de Daniel Knauf |publisher=Jimmy.fr |language=French |date=April 2005 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010161641/http://www.jimmy.fr/series/carnival/interview.html |archivedate=October 10, 2007}}</ref><ref name=carnycon2006>\n[[Daniel Knauf]] at Carny Con 2006.

Meanwhile, Jonesy has tracked Stroud to Sofie's place, overpowers him and releases her, but Sofie shoots Jonesy down. The next morning, the carnies find Brother Justin with Emma's blade in his chest and bring Ben, still breathing, back to their camp. Stumpy and Rita Sue, whose outstanding debts are now covered by Iris's honorarium, reassure Libby that Jonesy will soon return.

During their first few years, the band had two vocalists, Lehrer and Duane Hosein (who went on to form A Jealousy Issue). With this lineup, the band recorded the material for their first proper release, a split with South Florida band Promise No Tomorrow on Ohev Records. After this album, the band changed their name to Poison The Well, after the popular rhetorical device. The band then released their first album under their new name, ''[[Distance Only Makes the Heart Grow Fonder]]'' in 1998. The album gained them the attention of [[Trustkill Records]] who signed them to a multi-album deal. After Lehrer and Hosein exited the band, Jeffrey Moreira came in to fulfill vocal duties and remained with the band until their break up. With this solidified lineup, the band released ''[[The Opposite of December|The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation]]'' in 1999.\n[[Image:PTW-closeup-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jeffrey Moreira live in 2007]]\n\n===''Tear from the Red'' (2001\u20132003) ===\n''[[Tear from the Red]]'' was a transitional record for Poison The Well. ''Tear from the Red'' was recorded in six weeks at Studio 13 in Pompano Beach, Florida for $6,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The band had wanted to make a record that had more melody but still could be extremely heavy at the same time. After the record was completed, the band started a rigorous tour cycle that took them all over the US and Canada. They toured with many bands including: [[Hatebreed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1063|title=Dates for Hatebreed, Poison The Well, Bane tour|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> [[Kittie]],<ref name=\"lambgoat.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1581|title=Kittie, PTW, Shadows Fall, and KsE dates|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> [[Killswitch Engage]],<ref name=\"lambgoat.com\"/> [[Unearth]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=827|title=PTW, Martyr, God Forbid, Unearth tour|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> and [[Eighteen Visions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2551|title=DEP, etc. tapped for Plea For Peace tour|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===''You Come Before You'' (2003\u20132005)===\nThe success of ''Tear from the Red'' and their continuous touring schedule helped Poison The Well gain the attention of some major labels, which had started to take interest in bands coming from the hardcore scene. The band signed with [[Atlantic Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1394|title=Poison The Well getting new record deal|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> in 2002 and started writing for their third studio album, ''[[You Come Before You]]''.\n\nPoison the Well wanted to continue the evolution of their sound and felt that they needed a team of people who understood where they were going and what they wanted to do. They recorded with Swedish producers Pelle Henricsson and Eskil L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2164|title=Poison The Well begins tracking new album|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> Both had worked on many influential mid to late nineties Swedish hardcore records, including [[Refused]]'s ''[[Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent]]''<ref>[http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc06b.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203025323/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc06b.html |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> and ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]''.<ref>[http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc02.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203021521/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc02.htm |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> The band first recorded in Van Nuys, California at Sound City Studios and completed the rest at Tonteknik Recording AB in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. After the record was complete, the band started a year and a half tour cycle that took them to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2321|title=Poison The Well update|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> Towards the end, many of the band members were worn out and unsure if they wanted to continue with Poison the Well.\n[[File:Chris Hornbrook, Australia 2009.jpg|thumb|Chris Hornbrook performs at Australia's Soundwave festival 2009]]\n\n===''Versions'' (2005\u20132008)===\nHaving experienced some level of success with their previous record, ''You Come Before You'', a long and hard touring cycle left certain members of the band disenchanted. In the summer of 2004, guitarist Derek Miller quit the band. Miller had been in Poison the Well for all three prior releases and was a major part of the writing process. Poison The Well had been in the middle of pre-production for an entire record's worth of material when Miller announced his departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=3861|title=Derek Miller quits Poison The Well|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> This material would eventually get scrapped due to the overall unhappiness with the direction he had taken the band. The remaining three members took some time to figure out what they wanted to do. They eventually regrouped, added guitarist Jason Boyer to replace Miller, and started working on new musical ideas that would be the early stages of their fourth studio album, ''[[Versions (Poison the Well album)|Versions]]''.\n\nAfter months of working and writing material, the band set off in early 2005 to work and record with Pelle Henricsson and Eskil L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m at Tonteknik Studios in Ume\u00e5, Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/ptwellversions.htm|title=Poison The Well - Versions|publisher=Heavymetal.about.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> This would be the first session out of three that the band would record for ''Versions'' and what would eventually become ''[[I/III / II/III / III/III]]'' in 2009. They had worked with Henricsson and L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m on ''You Come Before You'' and had been also working with them on follow up material when Derek Miller had quit. The band felt that Henricsson and L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m were perfect for producing and capturing this \"new direction and sound\" they were creating and moving towards. After completing the first two recording sessions and returning home, Poison the Well announced that they were parting ways with Atlantic Records after only one album because of \"creative differences\". Atlantic Records had given full creative control with the writing and recording of ''You Come Before You'', not interfering and allowing the band to do what they pleased. But, after not seeing eye to eye on the direction Poison The Well had decided to move, Atlantic agreed to let the band go.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=6920|title=Poison The Well splits with Atlantic Recs|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref>\n\nEven though the band had no label, they returned to writing material for the third and final session. The band had been in contact with [[Ferret Music]] president Carl Severson about signing with the label. Severson had been friends and a fan of the band for many years and expressed interest in signing them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=7802|title=Poison The Well signs w/ Ferret Music|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> After signing at the end of 2006, the band left once again for Sweden to finish up the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=7942 |title=Poison The Well finishes recording album |website=Lambgoat.com |date=2006-12-10 |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> ''Versions'' was released on Ferret Music on April 2, 2007 in Europe and April 3, 2007 worldwide.

The band wanted to make a record that was more focused musically and bigger sonically. Poison the Well wrote the entire record in four and a half months in a condemned and purportedly haunted bar, the remnants of Ray's Downtown Blues which is now Longboards, in West Palm Beach, Florida. ''The Tropic Rot'' had originally been slated to be made with producer J. Robbins, but had to be cancelled due to a serious family emergency. [[Steve Evetts]] was picked among other potential producers the band thought could capture the record the way they wanted it and could start as soon as possible. The record was recorded at Castle Oaks Production and The Candy Shop studios and was released on July 7, 2009 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/20120722213232/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=4385025&blogId=478844489 |title=THE TROPIC ROT - available July 7th (date changed) von Poison The Well bei Myspace |website=Archive.is |date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> through Ferret Music.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116761]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album charted at No.&nbsp;180 in its first week of release on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nWhile on the first stop of their September 2009 tour with [[Billy Talent]], Poison The Well was robbed at a tour stop in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].

During their first few years, the band had two vocalists, Lehrer and Duane Hosein (who went on to form A Jealousy Issue). With this lineup, the band recorded the material for their first proper release, a split with South Florida band Promise No Tomorrow on Ohev Records. After this album, the band changed their name to Poison The Well, after the popular rhetorical device. The band then released their first album under their new name, ''[[Distance Only Makes the Heart Grow Fonder]]'' in 1998. The album gained them the attention of [[Trustkill Records]] who signed them to a multi-album deal. After Lehrer and Hosein exited the band, Jeffrey Moreira came in to fulfill vocal duties and remained with the band until their break up. With this solidified lineup, the band released ''[[The Opposite of December|The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation]]'' in 1999.\n[[Image:PTW-closeup-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jeffrey Moreira live in 2007]]\n\n===''Tear from the Red'' (2001\u20132003) ===\n''[[Tear from the Red]]'' was a transitional record for Poison The Well. ''Tear from the Red'' was recorded in six weeks at Studio 13 in Pompano Beach, Florida for $6,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The band had wanted to make a record that had more melody but still could be extremely heavy at the same time. After the record was completed, the band started a rigorous tour cycle that took them all over the US and Canada. They toured with many bands including: [[Hatebreed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1063|title=Dates for Hatebreed, Poison The Well, Bane tour|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> [[Kittie]],<ref name=\"lambgoat.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1581|title=Kittie, PTW, Shadows Fall, and KsE dates|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> [[Killswitch Engage]],<ref name=\"lambgoat.com\"/> [[Unearth]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=827|title=PTW, Martyr, God Forbid, Unearth tour|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> and [[Eighteen Visions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2551|title=DEP, etc. tapped for Plea For Peace tour|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===''You Come Before You'' (2003\u20132005)===\nThe success of ''Tear from the Red'' and their continuous touring schedule helped Poison The Well gain the attention of some major labels, which had started to take interest in bands coming from the hardcore scene. The band signed with [[Atlantic Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1394|title=Poison The Well getting new record deal|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> in 2002 and started writing for their third studio album, ''[[You Come Before You]]''.\n\nPoison the Well wanted to continue the evolution of their sound and felt that they needed a team of people who understood where they were going and what they wanted to do. They recorded with Swedish producers Pelle Henricsson and Eskil L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2164|title=Poison The Well begins tracking new album|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> Both had worked on many influential mid to late nineties Swedish hardcore records, including [[Refused]]'s ''[[Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent]]''<ref>[http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc06b.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203025323/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc06b.html |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> and ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]''.<ref>[http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc02.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203021521/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc02.htm |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> The band first recorded in Van Nuys, California at Sound City Stuidos and completed the rest at Tonteknik Recording AB in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. After the record was complete, the band started a year and a half tour cycle that took them to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2321|title=Poison The Well update|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> Towards the end, many of the band members were worn out and unsure if they wanted to continue with Poison the Well.\n[[File:Chris Hornbrook, Australia 2009.jpg|thumb|Chris Hornbrook performs at Australia's Soundwave festival 2009]]\n\n===''Versions'' (2005\u20132008)===\nHaving experienced some level of success with their previous record, ''You Come Before You'', a long and hard touring cycle left certain members of the band disenchanted. In the summer of 2004, guitarist Derek Miller quit the band. Miller had been in Poison the Well for all three prior releases and was a major part of the writing process. Poison The Well had been in the middle of pre-production for an entire record's worth of material when Miller announced his departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=3861|title=Derek Miller quits Poison The Well|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> This material would eventually get scrapped due to the overall unhappiness with the direction he had taken the band. The remaining three members took some time to figure out what they wanted to do. They eventually regrouped, added guitarist Jason Boyer to replace Miller, and started working on new musical ideas that would be the early stages of their fourth studio album, ''[[Versions (Poison the Well album)|Versions]]''.\n\nAfter months of working and writing material, the band set off in early 2005 to work and record with Pelle Henricsson and Eskil L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m at Tonteknik Studios in Ume\u00e5, Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/ptwellversions.htm|title=Poison The Well - Versions|publisher=Heavymetal.about.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> This would be the first session out of three that the band would record for ''Versions'' and what would eventually become ''[[I/III / II/III / III/III]]'' in 2009. They had worked with Henricsson and L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m on ''You Come Before You'' and had been also working with them on follow up material when Derek Miller had quit. The band felt that Henricsson and L\u00f6vstr\u00f6m were perfect for producing and capturing this \"new direction and sound\" they were creating and moving towards. After completing the first two recording sessions and returning home, Poison the Well announced that they were parting ways with Atlantic Records after only one album because of \"creative differences\". Atlantic Records had given full creative control with the writing and recording of ''You Come Before You'', not interfering and allowing the band to do what they pleased. But, after not seeing eye to eye on the direction Poison The Well had decided to move, Atlantic agreed to let the band go.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=6920|title=Poison The Well splits with Atlantic Recs|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref>\n\nEven though the band had no label, they returned to writing material for the third and final session. The band had been in contact with [[Ferret Music]] president Carl Severson about signing with the label. Severson had been friends and a fan of the band for many years and expressed interest in signing them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=7802|title=Poison The Well signs w/ Ferret Music|publisher=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> After signing at the end of 2006, the band left once again for Sweden to finish up the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=7942 |title=Poison The Well finishes recording album |website=Lambgoat.com |date=2006-12-10 |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> ''Versions'' was released on Ferret Music on April 2, 2007 in Europe and April 3, 2007 worldwide. On February 22, 2007 they began touring in support of the album.\n\n===''The Tropic Rot'' and hiatus (2009\u20132010)===\n[[File:Bradley Grace, Australia, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bradley Grace, Australia, 2009]]\nThe writing process for ''[[The Tropic Rot]]'' started a few weeks after Poison the Well finished up the touring cycle for ''Versions''. The band wanted to make a record that was more focused musically and bigger sonically. Poison the Well wrote the entire record in four and a half months in a condemned and purportedly haunted bar, the remnants of Ray's Downtown Blues which is now Longboards, in West Palm Beach, Florida. ''The Tropic Rot'' had originally been slated to be made with producer J. Robbins, but had to be cancelled due to a serious family emergency. [[Steve Evetts]] was picked among other potential producers the band thought could capture the record the way they wanted it and could start as soon as possible. The record was recorded at Castle Oaks Production and The Candy Shop studios and was released on July 7, 2009 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/20120722213232/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=4385025&blogId=478844489 |title=THE TROPIC ROT - available July 7th (date changed) von Poison The Well bei Myspace |website=Archive.is |date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> through Ferret Music.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116761]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album charted at No.&nbsp;180 in its first week of release on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nWhile on the first stop of their September 2009 tour with [[Billy Talent]], Poison The Well was robbed at a tour stop in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. As the band was asleep in their hotel, thieves drove off with their van and trailer containing all of their musical gear, band merchandise, and a majority of their personal possessions and clothes.

The museum started in 1971 with the purchase of a former [[Erie Railroad]] Depot from the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]]. Since then the museum has grown to include a one-mile demonstration railroad, connecting it with the [[New York Museum of Transportation]] in [[Rush, New York|Rush]], making it one of the only operating railroad museums in New York State. The museum was formerly an operation of the Rochester Chapter [[National Railway Historical Society]] until 2011. The organization rosters more than 40 pieces of historic railroad equipment, including diesel and steam locomotives, electric [[tram|trolley]] and multiple-unit cars, freight cars, cabooses, passenger cars, and work equipment. The museum campus includes a number of preserved railroad structures, including the 1909 Industry Depot built by the [[Erie Railroad]], a waiting shelter from the [[Rochester, Lockport and Buffalo Railroad|Rochester, Lockport & Buffalo Railroad]], and a crossing watchman's shanty from the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]]. Train rides are operated and the museum is open to the public on select weekends from June through October, and is staffed entirely by volunteers.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Site history ===\nThe site of the RGVRRM has been home to railroading since 1851, the year when the [[Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad]] was chartered.  This depot served the nearby village of [[Scottsville, New York|Scottsville]], approximately three miles to the west, from 1853 to 1874.  The depot provided the village with daily mail, express, and passenger service by means of an omnibus. In 1858 the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad was leased to the Buffalo, New York & Erie Railroad, which in turn was controlled by the [[Erie Railway]].  By 1874 the [[Rochester and State Line Railroad]] reached the village of Scottsville proper, and the Erie depot became less attractive to local citizens. The Rochester and State Line would eventually become part of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio]], and currently, as of 1986, operated as [[Rochester and Southern Railroad]].\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the Erie electrified the line from downtown Rochester to [[Mount Morris (village), New York|Mount Morris, NY]]. This was the only part of the Erie that was electrified. The 34-mile electric line was put into service on June 18, 1907. The route from Rochester to Mount Morris was covered in about an hour and ten minutes, and hourly service was provided from 6:00am to 11:30pm. The improvements never managed to pay for themselves, and electric service was discontinued in 1934.<ref>http://erielackhs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=16</ref>\n\nPassenger service ended in September 1941, though many freight customers remained on the line. Industry depot was used as a freight agency until the mid-1950s when it was closed and the building was used for storage. In 1960 the Erie merged with the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]]. As a result of general economic downturn and the devastation in the aftermath of 1972's [[Hurricane Agnes]], Erie Lackawanna became a part of [[Conrail]] 1976. In 1996, the short line [[Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad]] acquired the route north of Avon and continues to operate the former Erie branch today.\n\nThroughout the railroads' presence, the depot has had several names. At first it was named Scottsville, for the nearby village. Once a railroad was built through Scottsville, the name of the depot was changed to Oatka, named for [[Oatka Creek]], which flows into the nearby [[Genesee River]]. In 1902, the \"State Agricultural & Industrial School,\" a school for troubled boys, relocated to the Town of Rush.<ref>Unknown. [http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/calendar/160th%20bulletin%20-%20publisher%202003.pdf \"Industry School 160th Anniversary & Family Day\"], 2009, Accessed January 7, 2011</ref> When the current depot was constructed in about 1909, the name was changed to Industry, to reflect the small community that the School had created.\n\n=== Museum history ===\n{{Infobox station\n | name=Industry\n | style=Erie Railroad\n | type=\n | image=RGVRRM Depot.jpg\n | image_caption=The former Erie Railroad depot in 2010.

After a survey of several locations around [[Rochester, New York]], the former Erie Depot, located in Industry, was selected. The depot was built in 1909 as \"Oatka,\" later changed to \"Industry\" after the newly established state school for boys. The depot features two waiting rooms, separated by the agent's office. It was custom of the time to provide separate waiting areas for men and women. In later years, the separate waiting room was used to segregate inmates from the state school from the public.\n\nThe last passenger train stopped at Industry on September 30, 1941, and the depot was closed in 1950. Over the years, the Erie survived a few name changes and bankruptcies and merged with its long-time competitor to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. The Rochester Chapter was seeking a home and possible museum site for its activities, and discovered Industry depot was available. The depot had been abandoned since 1957, and by December 1969, the Rochester Chapter had adopted it as their new home. The depot was purchased outright from EL in 1971 for the ceremonial sum of $1.00. After years of restoration by volunteers, the Depot has been restored to how it would have appeared in the 1930s.\n\nSince acquiring the depot, the museum has been growing both facilities and expanding track capacity. The site had no available sidings, even though the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad|Erie Lackawanna]] track was still in use for freight service. By 1979 volunteers had constructed enough track to receive the first piece of equipment, a [[Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway]] [[caboose]] #280.<ref>{{cite web|title=Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh #280|url=http://rgvrrm.org/about/railroad/brp280/index.htm|website=Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad Museum|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> In 1981, the RGVRRM got its first locomotive, EK 6, recently retired from [[Eastman Kodak]]. Volunteers started to acquire additional railroad and construction equipment. This led to the eventual completion of a {{convert|1|mi|km}} demonstration railroad, completed in 1993.\n\nTrack cars, or [[railroad speeder|speeder]]s, were first used to give visitors rides on the museum demonstration railroad. In addition to track cars, diesel-hauled trains are operated for special events. In 1998, the museum began their popular Diesel Days weekend celebration showcasing the collection of operating vintage diesels for the public. Regular operation of track cars ended in 2010, and all rides are now provided by diesel-hauled trains consisting of restored freight train cabooses. The museum continues to grow and expand, with additional storage space planned to house its unique collection of equipment. The museum is unique as it is one of the only operating railroad museums in New York State. The museum prides itself on maintaining most of its collection in operating condition, which further enhances the visitor experience.\n\n==Collection==\n\nThe collection of the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum is quite extensive. The RGVRRM rosters 10 locomotives, 13 freight cars, 15 pieces of passenger equipment and various other pieces of rail equipment. Of note, distinctive high-hood \"Hammerhead\" [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] [[RS3m]] 211 is part of the operating collection. The museum is also home to the sole remaining [[trolley car]] (Car # 60) from the [[Rochester Subway]] fleet, returned to Rochester Chapter in 1998 after being on loan and later in storage for many years.<ref>Warner, Rand. [http://rgvrrm.org/media/semaphore/RCNRHS_Semaphore_199806.pdf \"Car #60 Arrived at R&GV RR Yard at 9:45 AM, Friday, June 5, 1998\"], \"The Semaphore\", June 1998, Accessed January 7, 2011</ref> In 1998 a steel building was erected to assist in the preservation and restoration of equipment. 2007 saw the arrival of the seven Budd-built 1941-vintage [[Empire State Express]] coaches that are used for Fall Foliage trips, operated on the [[Ontario Midland Railroad]] between 1993-2004, and most recently on the [[Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad]].\n\nBecause Rochester is known as the \"World's Image Center\" and is associated with photography and the home of [[Eastman Kodak]], the museum boasts an extensive collection of photos. Of note is the collection of steam-era images from Robert Carper, a Rochester native who authored \"American Railroads in Transition.\" Many of the photos from that book are now in the museum's collection, and on display for visitors to enjoy.\n\nOther artifacts include an extensive collection of signaling equipment. Rochester was home to [[General Railway Signal]], and as such the installation and operation of signals on the railroad is a long-term goal. Items include an operating [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphore]], searchlights, an under restoration [[Saxby and Farmer]] [[Lever frame|armstrong machine]] and a [[Union Switch and Signal]] [[Centralized traffic control|CTC Machine]].\n\n=== Locomotives ===\n\n[[Image:LV211AndUSA1843.jpg|thumb|250px|right|LV 211 and USA 1843 parked in Industry Yard.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The museum started in 1971 with the purchase of a former [[Erie Railroad]] Depot from the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]]. Since then the museum has grown to include a one-mile demonstration railroad, connecting it with the [[New York Transportation Museum]] in [[Rush, New York|Rush]], making it one of the only operating railroad museums in New York State. The museum was formerly an operation of the Rochester Chapter [[National Railway Historical Society]] until 2011. The organization rosters more than 40 pieces of historic railroad equipment, including diesel and steam locomotives, electric [[tram|trolley]] and multiple-unit cars, freight cars, cabooses, passenger cars, and work equipment. The museum campus includes a number of preserved railroad structures, including the 1909 Industry Depot built by the [[Erie Railroad]], a waiting shelter from the [[Rochester, Lockport and Buffalo Railroad|Rochester, Lockport & Buffalo Railroad]], and a crossing watchman's shanty from the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]]. Train rides are operated and the museum is open to the public on select weekends from June through October, and is staffed entirely by volunteers.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Site history ===\nThe site of the RGVRRM has been home to railroading since 1851, the year when the [[Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad]] was chartered.  This depot served the nearby village of [[Scottsville, New York|Scottsville]], approximately three miles to the west, from 1853 to 1874.  The depot provided the village with daily mail, express, and passenger service by means of an omnibus. In 1858 the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad was leased to the Buffalo, New York & Erie Railroad, which in turn was controlled by the [[Erie Railway]].  By 1874 the [[Rochester and State Line Railroad]] reached the village of Scottsville proper, and the Erie depot became less attractive to local citizens. The Rochester and State Line would eventually become part of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio]], and currently, as of 1986, operated as [[Rochester and Southern Railroad]].\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the Erie electrified the line from downtown Rochester to [[Mount Morris (village), New York|Mount Morris, NY]]. This was the only part of the Erie that was electrified. The 34-mile electric line was put into service on June 18, 1907. The route from Rochester to Mount Morris was covered in about an hour and ten minutes, and hourly service was provided from 6:00am to 11:30pm. The improvements never managed to pay for themselves, and electric service was discontinued in 1934.<ref>http://erielackhs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=16</ref>\n\nPassenger service ended in September 1941, though many freight customers remained on the line. Industry depot was used as a freight agency until the mid-1950s when it was closed and the building was used for storage. In 1960 the Erie merged with the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]]. As a result of general economic downturn and the devastation in the aftermath of 1972's [[Hurricane Agnes]], Erie Lackawanna became a part of [[Conrail]] 1976. In 1996, the short line [[Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad]] acquired the route north of Avon and continues to operate the former Erie branch today.\n\nThroughout the railroads' presence, the depot has had several names. At first it was named Scottsville, for the nearby village. Once a railroad was built through Scottsville, the name of the depot was changed to Oatka, named for [[Oatka Creek]], which flows into the nearby [[Genesee River]]. In 1902, the \"State Agricultural & Industrial School,\" a school for troubled boys, relocated to the Town of Rush.<ref>Unknown. [http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/calendar/160th%20bulletin%20-%20publisher%202003.pdf \"Industry School 160th Anniversary & Family Day\"], 2009, Accessed January 7, 2011</ref> When the current depot was constructed in about 1909, the name was changed to Industry, to reflect the small community that the School had created.\n\n=== Museum history ===\n{{Infobox station\n | name=Industry\n | style=Erie Railroad\n | type=\n | image=RGVRRM Depot.jpg\n | image_caption=The former Erie Railroad depot in 2010.

After a survey of several locations around [[Rochester, New York]], the former Erie Depot, located in Industry, was selected. The depot was built in 1909 as \"Oatka,\" later changed to \"Industry\" after the newly established state school for boys. The depot features two waiting rooms, separated by the agent's office. It was custom of the time to provide separate waiting areas for men and women. In later years, the separate waiting room was used to segregate inmates from the state school from the public.\n\nThe last passenger train stopped at Industry on September 30, 1941, and the depot was closed in 1950. Over the years, the Erie survived a few name changes and bankruptcies and merged with its long-time competitor to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. The Rochester Chapter was seeking a home and possible museum site for its activities, and discovered Industry depot was available. The depot had been abandoned since 1957, and by December 1969, the Rochester Chapter had adopted it as their new home. The depot was purchased outright from EL in 1971 for the ceremonial sum of $1.00. After years of restoration by volunteers, the Depot has been restored to how it would have appeared in the 1930s.\n\nSince acquiring the depot, the museum has been growing both facilities and expanding track capacity. The site had no available sidings, even though the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad|Erie Lackawanna]] track was still in use for freight service. By 1979 volunteers had constructed enough track to receive the first piece of equipment, a [[Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway]] [[caboose]] #280.<ref>{{cite web|title=Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh #280|url=http://rgvrrm.org/about/railroad/brp280/index.htm|website=Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad Museum|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> In 1981, the RGVRRM got its first locomotive, EK 6, recently retired from [[Eastman Kodak]]. Volunteers started to acquire additional railroad and construction equipment. This led to the eventual completion of a {{convert|1|mi|km}} demonstration railroad, completed in 1993.\n\nTrack cars, or [[railroad speeder|speeder]]s, were first used to give visitors rides on the museum demonstration railroad. In addition to track cars, diesel-hauled trains are operated for special events. In 1998, the museum began their popular Diesel Days weekend celebration showcasing the collection of operating vintage diesels for the public. Regular operation of track cars ended in 2010, and all rides are now provided by diesel-hauled trains consisting of restored freight train cabooses. The museum continues to grow and expand, with additional storage space planned to house its unique collection of equipment. The museum is unique as it is one of the only operating railroad museums in New York State. The museum prides itself on maintaining most of its collection in operating condition, which further enhances the visitor experience.\n\n==Collection==\n\nThe collection of the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum is quite extensive. The RGVRRM rosters 10 locomotives, 13 freight cars, 15 pieces of passenger equipment and various other pieces of rail equipment. Of note, distinctive high-hood \"Hammerhead\" [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] [[RS3m]] 211 is part of the operating collection. The museum is also home to the sole remaining [[trolley car]] (Car # 60) from the [[Rochester Subway]] fleet, returned to Rochester Chapter in 1998 after being on loan and later in storage for many years.<ref>Warner, Rand. [http://rgvrrm.org/media/semaphore/RCNRHS_Semaphore_199806.pdf \"Car #60 Arrived at R&GV RR Yard at 9:45 AM, Friday, June 5, 1998\"], \"The Semaphore\", June 1998, Accessed January 7, 2011</ref> In 1998 a steel building was erected to assist in the preservation and restoration of equipment. 2007 saw the arrival of the seven Budd-built 1941-vintage [[Empire State Express]] coaches that are used for Fall Foliage trips, operated on the [[Ontario Midland Railroad]] between 1993-2004, and most recently on the [[Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad]].\n\nBecause Rochester is known as the \"World's Image Center\" and is associated with photography and the home of [[Eastman Kodak]], the museum boasts an extensive collection of photos. Of note is the collection of steam-era images from Robert Carper, a Rochester native who authored \"American Railroads in Transition.\" Many of the photos from that book are now in the museum's collection, and on display for visitors to enjoy.\n\nOther artifacts include an extensive collection of signaling equipment. Rochester was home to [[General Railway Signal]], and as such the installation and operation of signals on the railroad is a long-term goal. Items include an operating [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphore]], searchlights, an under restoration [[Saxby and Farmer]] [[Lever frame|armstrong machine]] and a [[Union Switch and Signal]] [[Centralized traffic control|CTC Machine]].\n\n=== Locomotives ===\n\n[[Image:LV211AndUSA1843.jpg|thumb|250px|right|LV 211 and USA 1843 parked in Industry Yard.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Mutasa District is located 30&nbsp;km northeast [[Mutare]] and stretches up to the [[Honde Valley]], which is about 100&nbsp;km northeast of [[Mutare]] along a tarred road that branches off the [[Nyanga, Zimbabwe|Nyanga]] road.<ref>Central Statistical Office, Zimbabwe, Census 1992, Provincial profile.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Manicaland districts.png|thumb|A map of the districts of Manicaland Province]]\nMutasa District has an area of 2,548 km\u00b2. [[Watsomba]] is the administrative headquarters. The district is bounded on the south and southwest by [[Mutare District]], on the west by [[Makoni District]], on the north by [[Nyanga District]], and on the east and southeast by [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe [[Nyanga Mountains]] occupy the northern portion of the district, and a portion of [[Nyanga National Park]] is in the district. [[Mount Nyangani]] (2,592 m) is the highest peak in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe [[Pungwe River]] originates on Mount Nyangani. The [[Honde Valley]] lies south of the Nyanga Mountains, and is drained by the [[Honde River]], a tributary of the Pungwe. South of the Honde Valley, Mt Rupere (2,030 m) divides the Honda valley from the Nyamkukwarara Valley, which is drained by the Nyamkukwarara River, another Pungwe tributary.<ref>BirdLife International (2020) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Stapleford Forest. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 12/04/2020.</ref>  The Pungwe, Honde, and Nyamkukwarara all drain northeastwards into [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe western part of the district lies in the upper basin of the [[Odzi River]], a tributary of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]]. [[Osborne Dam]] is on the Odzi.\n\n==Population==\nThe 2012 census recorded a population of 167,462 for the district.\n\n===Townships and villages===\n* Chijara Village\n* Chipupuri Village\n* [[Hauna]] Growth Point\n* Kwambana Village\n* Muponda Village\n* Old Mutare Mission\n* Penalonga\n* [[Watsomba]]\n* Zindi Township\n\n==Economy==\nMutasa District's economy is agriculture-based. Villagers practice semi-commercial agriculture. And the district has several plantations and estates that provide employment. Villages raise cattle, goats and chickens. They grow maize, groundnuts, sugarcane etc. and have plantations for fruit trees in the fields. Some of the villages are small landholder growers of coffee, tea and banana plantations. Large scale commercial plantations produce timber, coffee and tea estates.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nCompared with other districts in [[Manicaland Province]], Mutasa District has better infrastructure.\n\n===Road network===\nThe district is serviced by a network of surfaced and gravel roads. The main highways are the [[Mutare]]\u2013[[Nyanga, Zimbabwe|Nyanga]] A15 highway, and the Selbourne to [[Honde Valley]] road. During the rainy season some parts of the district are inaccessible by road due to the bad state of roads. The district council does not have the capacity to maintain gravel roads, hence the [[District Development Fund]](DDF) is now maintaining most of the gravel roads. In [[Honde Valley]] some areas are only accessible only by four-wheel-drive enabled vehicles due to the terrain.\n\n===Communication Technology===\nMost of the district is covered by wireless or cell phone networks, although mountainous areas of the district have poor reception. Land telephone lines connect most of the business centres throughout the district. Villages and business centers with telephone services have access to the internet.\n\n===Dams and Water Infrastructure===\nMutasa District is in the Highveld, receiving high rainfall, hence there are a number of small to large dams in the district, the major ones being [[Osborne Dam]] and Nyawamba Dam. The [[Pungwe]]\u2013[[Mutare]] pipeline passes through the district, and the district is still to benefit from water points along the route. It is proving expensive for local communities to access the piped water from the Pungwe along the way to Mutare interims of acquiring the right pipes for their irrigations. In [[Honde Valley]], water supplied from by a number of small piped systems and motorised pumps serving small towns, growth points, commercial plantations, service centres and some villages, as well as direct abstractions from the rivers by riparian village communities not connected to developed installations.\n\n===Sanitation===\nUp to 90% of the population has Blair pit latrine and the rest have water-borne sewer system. Most of the Blair Pit latrines were constructed after independence in 1980.\n\n==Government and politics==\nMutasa District is divided into three constituencies Mutasa Central, Mutasa North and Mutasa South and the MPs are, Chido Mwadiwa and Misheck Kagurabadza respectively.\n\n==Education==\nMutasa has a number of schools run by the Ministry of Education<ref>http://www.moesac.gov.zw {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307210757/http://www.moesac.gov.zw/ |date=2013-03-07 }}</ref> and tertiary institutions.\n\n===Primary schools===\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* Sagambe Primary School\n* Chavhanga Primary School\n* Pachije St Stephen Primary\n* Chikomba Primary School\n* Chisuko Primary School\n* Aberfoyle Primary School\n* Eastern Highlands Primary Schools\n* Katiyo Primary School\n* Nyamhingura Primary School\n* Muterere Primary School\n* Muparutsa Primary School\n* Zindi Primary School\n* St James Haparari Primary School \n* Vumbunu Primary School\n* Sherukuru Primary School \n* St Francis Pimayi Primary School\n* Chitombo Primary School\n* Gatsi Primary School\n* Buwu Primary School\n* St Columbus Primary School\n* Samutete St Michaels Primary School\n* Rupinda Primary School\n* Muchena Primary School\n* Triashill Mission School\n* Chitombo Primary School\n* Sahumani Primary School\n* Makwasa Primary School\n* Kwambana Primary School\n* Manunure Primary School\n* Honde river \n* Samaringa\n* Costern\n* Nyamaende\n* St Peters Jombe Primary School\n* Holy Family School Nyatsanza Primary School\n* Mapfekera Primary School\n* Berthania Primary School\n* St Barbara's Mission school\n* St Johns Zambe Primary School\n* Tsvingwe Primary School\n* Samanga Primary School\n* St Exavier Chikumbu Primary School\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Secondary schools===\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* Sagambe Secondary School\n* Chavhanga Secondary School\n* Chisuko Secondary School\n* Muterere Secondary School\n* Zindi Secondary School\n* St Columbus Secondary School\n* Nyamhingura Secondary\n* St Mathias Tsonzo Secondary School\n* St James Zongoro Secondary School\n* Mwoyoweshumba Secondary School \n* Nyakatsapa High School \n* Gatsi Secondary School\n* Sahumani \n* Chitombo \n* Pafiwa Mutasa\n* Hartzell High School\n* Samaringa Secondary School\n* Triashill Mission\n* St Barabara's sec school\n* Zambe Secondary School\n* Sherukuru High School\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Tertiary institutions===\nThe district has a tertiary institution at Bonda and Honde Valley Mission. [[Africa University]] is also located in the District.\n\n==Health care==\n[[Zimbabwe]]'s public health care is delivered at four levels, which are meant to function as a referral chain. The first level is the primary level consisting of Rural Health Centres, Rural Hospitals and Urban Clinics (services do not require an attending Physician). The second level is the first referral level consisting of District Hospitals. The third level is the second referral level consisting of Provincial and General Hospitals. The fourth and final level is the third referral level to Central and Special Hospitals.\n\nMost of the health care facilities in the district are owned and run by the government's Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, although local communities are involved in the management of some clinics. The main referral hospitals are Hauna Hospital and Bonda Mission Hospital. There are several poly-clinics in the district that offer primary health care to people from the villages in the district. In recent years as the economy of [[Zimbabwe]] has declined, there has been a shortage of drugs and equipment at the hospitals although staffing levels by end of 2010 had improved. Communities also rely heavily on traditional medicines. The major diseases that affect the people in the district include [[diarrhea]], [[tuberculosis|TB]] and [[malaria]].\n\n===HIV/AIDS===\nLike the rest of the country, the [[HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe|HIV/AIDS]] pandemic is seriously affecting the district. However, there has been a decrease of reported HIV prevalence rate in the past decade.\n\n===Hospitals===\nHauna hospital, run through the Ministry of Health<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mohcw.gov.zw/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331154327/http://www.mohcw.gov.zw/ |archivedate=2013-03-31 }}</ref> was established in Honde valley as there was no district Hospital in the District and the only Mission Hospital at Bonda could not meet the District Health Demands.

Most people are Catholics (Anglicans, Methodists and Roman Catholics). [[African Apostolic Church]] (AAC) known as vekwa (Mwazha) large group also is a follower of the [[Johane Maranke|Johanne Marange]] Apostolic Sect.
