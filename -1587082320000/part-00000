They are one of the major dishes eaten during the [[Chinese New Year]] and year-round in the northern provinces. Though considered part of [[Chinese cuisine]], ''jiaozi'' are popular in other parts of East Asia and in the Western World.\n\n''Jiaozi'' typically consist of a [[ground meat]] and/or [[vegetable]] filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of [[dough]], which is then sealed by pressing the edges together. Finished ''jiaozi'' can be boiled (''shu\u01d0 ji\u01ceo''), steamed (''zh\u0113ng ji\u01ceo'') or pan-fried (''ji\u0101n ji\u01ceo'') and are traditionally served with a black vinegar and sesame oil dip. They can also be served with soup as well.\n\n==Origin and custom==\n[[File:Tang dynasty pottery dumplings.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Pottery dumpling and delicacies from a [[Tang dynasty]] tomb]]\n\nIn China, there are several different folk stories explaining the origin of ''jiaozi'' and its name.\n\nTraditionally, ''jiaozi'' were thought to be invented during the era of the [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han]] (AD 25\u2013220)<ref>{{cite web|title=Frozen ears: The story of gyozas|work=[[The Malay Mail]]|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/eat-drink/article/frozen-ears-the-story-of-gyozas|quote=One would always have suspected that the ubiquitous Japanese ''gyoza'' originated from China \u2013 and one would be completely right, unlike most economists. The origins of the ''gyoza'' are said to stem from the treatments invented by Zhang Zhongjing (150\u2013219 AD), a Han dynasty physician born in Nanyang.

''Jiaozi'' were originally referred to as \"tender ears\" ({{zh|s=\u5b0c\u8033|hp=jiao'er|l=|links=no|c=|t=}}) because they were used to treat frostbitten ears. Zhang Zhongjing was on his way home during wintertime, when he found many common people had frostbitten ears, because they did not have warm clothes and sufficient food. He treated these poor people by [[stew]]ing [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], black pepper, and some warming medicines in a pot, chopped them, and used them to fill small dough wrappers. He boiled these dumplings and gave them with the broth to his patients, until the coming of the Chinese New Year. In order to celebrate the New Year as well as recovering from frostbitten ears, people imitated Zhang's recipe to make ''Jiao'er''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sd.people.com.cn/n/2015/1223/c373024-27378537-3.html|title=\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u51ac\u81f3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5403\u997a\u5b50\u5417? \u533b\u5723\u5f20\u4ef2\u666f\u53d1\u660e|date=23 December 2015|website=\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51|publisher=\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51}}</ref>\n\nOther theories suggest that ''jiaozi'' may have derived from dumplings in Western Asia. In the [[Western Han dynasty]] (206 BC \u2013 AD 9) ''jiaozi'' (\u9903\u5b50) were called ''jiaozi'' (\u89d2\u5b50). During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (AD 220\u2013280), the book ''[[Guangya]]'' by [[Zhang Yi (Cao Wei)|Zhang Yi]] mentions ''jiaozi''. [[Yan Zhitui]] during the [[Northern Qi]] dynasty (AD 550\u2013577) wrote: \"Today the ''jiaozi'', shaped like a crescent moon, is a common food in the world.\" [[Six Dynasties]] [[Gaochang#Jushi Kingdom and early Han-Chinese rule|Turfan tomb]]s contained dumplings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailymeal.com/archaeologists-ancient-dumplings-xinjiang-china/21615|title=Archaeologists Discover Ancient Dumplings in China|publisher=}}</ref> Later in the [[Tang dynasty]] (AD 618\u2013907), ''jiaozi'' become more popular, called ''Bian Shi'' (\u6241\u98df).

They can be served as an appetizer, a side dish, or as the main course. In China, sometimes ''jiaozi'' is served as a last course during restaurant meals. As a breakfast dish, ''jiaozi'' are prepared alongside ''[[xiaolongbao]]'' at inexpensive roadside restaurants. Typically, they are served in small steamers containing ten pieces each. Although mainly serving ''jiaozi'' to breakfast customers, these small restaurants keep them hot on steamers and ready to eat all day. ''Jiaozi'' are always served with a dipping sauce that may include [[vinegar]], [[soy sauce]], [[garlic]], [[ginger]], [[rice wine]], [[hot sauce]], and [[sesame oil]]. They can also be served with soup as well.\n\n== Types ==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = BoiledDumplings.jpg\n| image2 = Pork dumplings (\u9bae\u8089\u84b8\u9903).jpg\n| image3 =  FriedDumplings.JPG\n| image4 = Spring soup dumplings (\u967d\u6625\u6e6f\u9903).jpg\n| footer = Four types of ''jiaozi''.

Common dumpling meat fillings include [[pork]], [[mutton]], [[beef]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Fish (food)|fish]], and [[shrimp]], which are usually mixed with chopped vegetables. Popular vegetable fillings include [[napa cabbage]], [[scallion]] (spring onions), [[leek]], [[celery]], [[spinach]], [[mushroom]], edible black fungus, carrot, and [[garlic chives]].\n\n== Folding technique ==\n[[File:Jiaozi 2.jpg|thumb|In the north China, folded ''jiaozi'' are rest on ''bi'' (\u7b85), in case the stuffing will make the shape saggy. ''Bi'' is made by dried [[sorghum]] stems, and it also gives Jiaozi a mark at the bottom.]]\nThere are many ways to fold ''jiaozi''. Basically, steps for folding the skin includes putting a single pleat in the middle, putting multiple pleats along the edge, making a wavy edge like a pie crust, turning a pleated edge in toward the body resulting in a rounded edge, and putting both ends together resulting in a round shape.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u9903\u5b50 |url=http://baike.baidu.com/subview/11144/7532109.htm?fromtitle=%E6%B0%B4%E9%A5%BA&fromid=761512&type=syn#3_1 |website=\u767e\u5ea6\u767e\u79d1 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref> Different shapes of Jiaozi require different folding techniques, but the most famous and common technique is the pinched-edge fold.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A World of Dumplings|last=Yarvin|first=Brian|publisher=The Countryman Press.

Use right thumb to clench those pleats.

The immediate noted difference to Northern style is that they are smaller and wrapped in a thinner translucent skin, and usually steamed. The smaller size and the thinner wrapper make the dumplings easier to cook through with steaming. In contrast to ''jiaozi'', Guangdong ''gaau ji'' are rarely home-made because the wrapper, which needs to be thin but tough enough to not break, is more difficult to make. Many types of fillings exist, with the most common type being [[har gow]] ({{zh|t=\u8766\u9903|s=\u867e\u997a|cy=h\u0101 g\u00e1au|l=shrimp dumplings}}), but fillings can include scallop, chicken, tofu, and mixed vegetables; dim sum restaurants often feature their own house specials or innovations. Dim sum chefs and artists often use ingredients in new or creative ways, or draw inspiration from other Chinese [[Cuisine of China|culinary traditions]], such as [[Teochew cuisine|Chaozhou]], [[Hakka cuisine|Hakka]], or [[Shanghai cuisine|Shanghai]]. More creative chefs may even create [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] ''gaau ji'' by using elements from other cultures, such as Japanese ([[teriyaki]]) or Southeast Asian ([[satay]] or [[curry]]), while upscale restaurants may use expensive or exotic ingredients such as [[lobster]], [[shark finning|shark fin]] and [[Bird's nest soup|bird's nest]].\n\nAnother Cantonese dumpling is [[yau gok]] ({{zh|c=\u6cb9\u89d2|p=y\u00f3u ji\u01ceo|cy=y\u00e0uh gok}}), which are made with [[glutinous rice]] [[dough]] and [[Deep frying|deep fried]].\n\n===Guotie===\n[[Image:MakingJiaozi.jpg|thumb|right|Making ''guotie'']]\n[[Image:Potstickers RTE.jpg|thumb|A plate of potstickers ''(guotie)'' and dipping sauce]]\n'''Guotie''' ({{zh|first=c|c={{linktext|\u934b\u8cbc}}|p={{linktext|gu\u014dti\u0113}}|l=pot stick}}) is pan-fried ''jiaozi'', also known as '''potstickers''' (a direct character translation) or 'panstickers' in North America, or ''yaki-gyoza'' in Japan. They are a Northern Chinese style [[dumpling]] popular as a [[street food]], appetizer, or side order in [[Chinese cuisine]]. This dish is sometimes served on a [[dim sum]] menu, but may be offered independently. The filling for this dish usually contains [[pork]] (sometimes [[chicken]], or beef in [[Muslim]] areas), [[cabbage]] (or [[Chinese cabbage]] and sometimes [[spinach]]), [[scallion]]s (spring or green onions), [[ginger]], Chinese rice wine or cooking wine, and sesame seed oil.\n\nGuotie are shallow-fried in a [[wok]] ({{zh|links=no|c=\u956c|p=hu\u00f2}}). A small quantity of water is added and the wok is covered. While the base of the dumplings is fried, the upper part is steamed and this gives a texture contrast typical of Chinese cuisine.\n\nAn alternative method is to steam in a wok and then fry to crispness on one side in a shallow frying pan.\n\nExactly the same dumpling is boiled in plenty of water to make jiaozi and both are eaten with a dipping sauce or chilli paste.\n[[File:Noodlecat - Lee Anne Wong - \"Lucky Dumpring Jiao Zi\" (6739677033).jpg|left|thumb|Fried dumplings served with Green Onion and sauce]]\n\nThree or five folds are made on one side of the round wrapper that is rolled so that the edges are thinner than the middle. This gives the base a large surface area that helps to give the dumpling stability to stand up in the pan.\n\nThe Chinese method of preparing the dough is to pour boiling water onto the flour and letting stand for five minutes and then adding a small quantity of cold water. This helps to activate the gluten in the dough.\n\nOther names for ''guotie'':\n* '''Peking ravioli'''{{spaced ndash}}In [[Boston]], ''[[guotie]]'' are known as \"Peking [[ravioli]]\", a name first coined at the [[Joyce Chen (chef)|Joyce Chen Restaurant]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chinesefood.about.com/library/bltrivia30.htm |title=What is Peking Ravioli? |publisher=About.com |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n* ''Wor tip'' (Cantonese ''[[Jyutping]]'': ''wo1 tip3'') is the Cantonese reading of the same [[Chinese characters]] that in Mandarin is read as ''gu\u014dti\u0113'\n\n====History====\n''Gu\u014dti\u0113'' is said to date back over four millennia. However, the first mention in literature dates back to the medieval Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (AD 960{{snd}}1280) reporting ''gu\u014dti\u0113'' as being exceptionally good for the human soul. Legend has it that they were invented by an imperial Chinese court chef who panicked after realizing he'd accidentally burnt a batch of dumplings. With no time to make any more, he eventually served them to the Emperor.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://vancouversun.com/life/Potstickers+tasty+traditional+dish+Lunar+Year/7922860/story.html |title= Potstickers: A tasty traditional dish for Lunar New Year |last= Fong |first=Nathan |website=The Vancouver Sun |publication-date=February 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Everything Chinese Cookbook: From Wonton Soup to Sweet and Sour Chicken  |last= Parkinson |first=Rhonda Lauret |publisher= Simon & Schuster Canada, Inc.  |year=2003}}</ref> 7th or 8th century old dumplings and wontons were found in [[Turfan]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Japanese version}}Gy\u014dza===\n[[File:Japanese_food_by_Naoki_Nakashima_202.jpg|thumb|Gy\u014dza with chili oil]]\n[[File:\u9903\u5b50\u6226\u4e89\u306e\u52c3\u767a (12277715405).jpg|thumb|[[Gyoza no Ohsho]] restaurant in Japan at [[Monzen-Nakach\u014d Station]]]]\nThe [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''gy\u014dza'' (\u30ae\u30e7\u30fc\u30b6, \u30ae\u30e7\u30a6\u30b6) was derived from the reading of \u9903\u5b50 in the [[Jilu Mandarin]] (''gi\u01ceoze'') and is written using the same Chinese characters. The selection of characters indicates that the word is of non-Japanese origin. Following the Second World War, Japanese soldiers who returned from northeastern China brought home gy\u014dza recipes.\n\nThe prevalent differences between Japanese-style gy\u014dza and Chinese-style jiaozi are the rich [[garlic]] flavor, which is less noticeable in the Chinese version, and that gy\u014dza wrappers appear to be consistently thinner, due to the fact that most Japanese restaurants use machine-made wrappers. In contrast, the rustic cuisine of poor Chinese immigrants shaped westerners' views that Chinese restaurant jiaozi use thicker handmade wrappers. As jiaozi vary greatly across regions within China, these differences are not clear. For example, visitors will easily find thin skinned ones at restaurants in [[Shanghai]], and from street food vendors in the [[Hangzhou]] region. Gy\u014dza are identical to jiaozi made in Chinese households using store bought machine made wrappers. Gy\u014dza are usually served with soy-based [[tare sauce]] seasoned with [[rice vinegar]] and/or [[chili oil]] (''[[r\u0101yu]]'' in Japanese, ''l\u00e0y\u00f3u'' (\u8fa3\u6cb9) in Mandarin Chinese). The most common recipe is a mixture of [[mincing|minced]] [[pork]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[cabbage]], [[Allium tuberosum|Asian chives]], and [[sesame oil]], and/or [[garlic]], and/or [[ginger]],{{citation needed |date=August 2016}} which is then wrapped into thinly rolled [[dough]] skins. Gyoza share similarities with both [[pierogi]] and [[spring roll]]s and are cooked in the same fashion as pierogi, either boiled or fried.\n\nGy\u014dza and gy\u014dza wrappers can be found in supermarkets and restaurants throughout Japan, either [[Frozen food|frozen]] or ready to eat. Pan-fried gy\u014dza are sold as a side dish in many ''[[ramen]]'' and [[Chuka (food)|Chinese restaurant]]s.\n\nThe most popular preparation method is the pan-fried style called ''yaki-gy\u014dza'' ({{lang|ja|\u713c\u304d\u9903\u5b50}}), in which the dumpling is first [[frying|fried]] on one flat side, creating a crispy skin. Then, water is added and the pan sealed with a lid, until the upper part of the dumpling is [[steaming|steamed]]. Other popular methods include [[boiled|boiling]] ''sui-gy\u014dza'' ({{lang|ja|\u6c34\u9903\u5b50}}) and [[deep frying]] ''age-gy\u014dza'' ({{lang|ja|\u63da\u3052\u9903\u5b50}}).\n\nStore-bought frozen dumplings are often prepared at home by first placing them in a pot of water, bringing it to a boil, and then transferring them to a pan with oil to fry the skin.\n\n====History====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Momo===\n{{Main|Momo (dumpling)}}\nThe Tibetan version is known as [[Momo (dumpling)|momo]] ([[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]]: \u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b) The word \"momo\" comes from a Chinese [[loanword]], \"momo\" ([[wikt:\u9943\u9943|\u9943\u9943]]),<ref>J\u012bn P\u00e9ng \u91d1\u9e4f (ed.): ''Z\u00e0ngy\u01d4 ji\u01cenzh\u00ec'' \u85cf\u8bed\u7b80\u5fd7.

When preparing momo, flour is filled, most commonly with ground [[water buffalo]] meat. Often, ground lamb or chicken meat is used as alternate to water buffalo meat. Finely chopped [[onion]], minced [[garlic]], fresh minced [[ginger]], [[cumin]] powder, salt, [[coriander]]/[[cilantro]], etc. are added to meat for flavoring.

Zhang Zhongjing was on his way home during wintertime, when he found many common people had frostbitten ears, because they did not have warm clothes and sufficient food. He treated these poor people by [[stew]]ing [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], black pepper, and some warming medicines in a pot, chopped them, and used them to fill small dough wrappers. He boiled these dumplings and gave them with the broth to his patients, until the coming of the Chinese New Year. In order to celebrate the New Year as well as recovering from frostbitten ears, people imitated Zhang's recipe to make ''Jiao'er''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sd.people.com.cn/n/2015/1223/c373024-27378537-3.html|title=\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u51ac\u81f3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5403\u997a\u5b50\u5417? \u533b\u5723\u5f20\u4ef2\u666f\u53d1\u660e|date=23 December 2015|website=\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51|publisher=\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51}}</ref>\n\nOther theories suggest that ''jiaozi'' may have derived from dumplings in Western Asia.

As a breakfast dish, ''jiaozi'' are prepared alongside ''[[xiaolongbao]]'' at inexpensive roadside restaurants. Typically, they are served in small steamers containing ten pieces each. Although mainly serving ''jiaozi'' to breakfast customers, these small restaurants keep them hot on steamers and ready to eat all day.

Common dumpling meat fillings include [[pork]], [[mutton]], [[beef]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Fish (food)|fish]], and [[shrimp]], which are usually mixed with chopped vegetables. Popular vegetable fillings include [[napa cabbage]], [[scallion]] (spring onions), [[leek]], [[celery]], [[spinach]], [[mushroom]], edible black fungus, carrot, and [[garlic chives]].\n\n== Folding technique ==\n[[File:Jiaozi 2.jpg|thumb|In the north China, folded ''jiaozi'' are rest on ''bi'' (\u7b85), in case the stuffing will make the shape saggy. ''Bi'' is made by dried [[sorghum]] stems, and it also gives Jiaozi a mark at the bottom.]]\nThere are many ways to fold ''jiaozi''. Basically, steps for folding the skin includes putting a single pleat in the middle, putting multiple pleats along the edge, making a wavy edge like a pie crust, turning a pleated edge in toward the body resulting in a rounded edge, and putting both ends together resulting in a round shape.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u9903\u5b50 |url=http://baike.baidu.com/subview/11144/7532109.htm?fromtitle=%E6%B0%B4%E9%A5%BA&fromid=761512&type=syn#3_1 |website=\u767e\u5ea6\u767e\u79d1 |accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref> Different shapes of Jiaozi require different folding techniques, but the most famous and common technique is the pinched-edge fold.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A World of Dumplings|last=Yarvin|first=Brian|publisher=The Countryman Press.

The immediate noted difference to Northern style is that they are smaller and wrapped in a thinner translucent skin, and usually steamed. The smaller size and the thinner wrapper make the dumplings easier to cook through with steaming. In contrast to ''jiaozi'', Guangdong ''gaau ji'' are rarely home-made because the wrapper, which needs to be thin but tough enough to not break, is more difficult to make. Many types of fillings exist, with the most common type being [[har gow]] ({{zh|t=\u8766\u9903|s=\u867e\u997a|cy=h\u0101 g\u00e1au|l=shrimp dumplings}}), but fillings can include scallop, chicken, tofu, and mixed vegetables; dim sum restaurants often feature their own house specials or innovations. Dim sum chefs and artists often use ingredients in new or creative ways, or draw inspiration from other Chinese [[Cuisine of China|culinary traditions]], such as [[Teochew cuisine|Chaozhou]], [[Hakka cuisine|Hakka]], or [[Shanghai cuisine|Shanghai]]. More creative chefs may even create [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] ''gaau ji'' by using elements from other cultures, such as Japanese ([[teriyaki]]) or Southeast Asian ([[satay]] or [[curry]]), while upscale restaurants may use expensive or exotic ingredients such as [[lobster]], [[shark finning|shark fin]] and [[Bird's nest soup|bird's nest]].\n\nAnother Cantonese dumpling is [[yau gok]] ({{zh|c=\u6cb9\u89d2|p=y\u00f3u ji\u01ceo|cy=y\u00e0uh gok}}), which are made with [[glutinous rice]] [[dough]] and [[Deep frying|deep fried]].\n\n===Guotie===\n[[Image:MakingJiaozi.jpg|thumb|right|Making ''guotie'']]\n[[Image:Potstickers RTE.jpg|thumb|A plate of potstickers ''(guotie)'' and dipping sauce]]\n'''Guotie''' ({{zh|first=c|c={{linktext|\u934b\u8cbc}}|p={{linktext|gu\u014dti\u0113}}|l=pot stick}}) is pan-fried ''jiaozi'', also known as '''potstickers''' (a direct character translation) or 'panstickers' in North America, or ''yaki-gyoza'' in Japan. They are a Northern Chinese style [[dumpling]] popular as a [[street food]], appetizer, or side order in [[Chinese cuisine]]. This dish is sometimes served on a [[dim sum]] menu, but may be offered independently. The filling for this dish usually contains [[pork]] (sometimes [[chicken]], or beef in [[Muslim]] areas), [[cabbage]] (or [[Chinese cabbage]] and sometimes [[spinach]]), [[scallion]]s (spring or green onions), [[ginger]], Chinese rice wine or cooking wine, and sesame seed oil.\n\nGuotie are shallow-fried in a [[wok]] (Chinese: \u956c; Pinyin: ''hu\u00f2''). A small quantity of water is added and the wok is covered. While the base of the dumplings is fried, the upper part is steamed and this gives a texture contrast typical of Chinese cuisine.\n\nAn alternative method is to steam in a wok and then fry to crispness on one side in a shallow frying pan.\n\nExactly the same dumpling is boiled in plenty of water to make jiaozi and both are eaten with a dipping sauce or chilli paste.\n[[File:Noodlecat - Lee Anne Wong - \"Lucky Dumpring Jiao Zi\" (6739677033).jpg|left|thumb|Fried dumplings served with Green Onion and sauce]]\n\nThree or five folds are made on one side of the round wrapper that is rolled so that the edges are thinner than the middle. This gives the base a large surface area that helps to give the dumpling stability to stand up in the pan.\n\nThe Chinese method of preparing the dough is to pour boiling water onto the flour and letting stand for five minutes and then adding a small quantity of cold water. This helps to activate the gluten in the dough.\n\nOther names for ''guotie'':\n* '''Peking ravioli'''{{spaced ndash}}In [[Boston]], ''[[guotie]]'' are known as \"Peking [[ravioli]]\", a name first coined at the [[Joyce Chen (chef)|Joyce Chen Restaurant]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chinesefood.about.com/library/bltrivia30.htm |title=What is Peking Ravioli? |publisher=About.com |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\n* ''Wor tip'' (Cantonese ''[[Jyutping]]'': ''wo1 tip3'') is the Cantonese reading of the same [[Chinese characters]] that in Mandarin is read as ''gu\u014dti\u0113'\n\n====History====\n''Gu\u014dti\u0113'' is said to date back over four millennia. However, the first mention in literature dates back to the medieval Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (AD 960{{snd}}1280) reporting ''gu\u014dti\u0113'' as being exceptionally good for the human soul. Legend has it that they were invented by an imperial Chinese court chef who panicked after realizing he'd accidentally burnt a batch of dumplings.

The selection of characters indicates that the word is of non-Japanese origin. Following the Second World War, Japanese soldiers who returned from northeastern China brought home gy\u014dza recipes.\n\nThe prevalent differences between Japanese-style gy\u014dza and Chinese-style jiaozi are the rich [[garlic]] flavor, which is less noticeable in the Chinese version, and that gy\u014dza wrappers appear to be consistently thinner, due to the fact that most Japanese restaurants use machine-made wrappers. In contrast, the rustic cuisine of poor Chinese immigrants shaped westerners' views that Chinese restaurant jiaozi use thicker handmade wrappers. As jiaozi vary greatly across regions within China, these differences are not clear. For example, visitors will easily find thin skinned ones at restaurants in [[Shanghai]], and from street food vendors in the [[Hangzhou]] region. Gy\u014dza are identical to jiaozi made in Chinese households using store bought machine made wrappers. Gy\u014dza are usually served with soy-based [[tare sauce]] seasoned with [[rice vinegar]] and/or [[chili oil]] (''[[r\u0101yu]]'' in Japanese, ''l\u00e0y\u00f3u'' (\u8fa3\u6cb9) in Mandarin Chinese). The most common recipe is a mixture of [[mincing|minced]] [[pork]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[cabbage]], [[Allium tuberosum|Asian chives]], and [[sesame oil]], and/or [[garlic]], and/or [[ginger]],{{citation needed |date=August 2016}} which is then wrapped into thinly rolled [[dough]] skins. Gyoza share similarities with both [[pierogi]] and [[spring roll]]s and are cooked in the same fashion as pierogi, either boiled or fried.\n\nGy\u014dza and gy\u014dza wrappers can be found in supermarkets and restaurants throughout Japan, either [[Frozen food|frozen]] or ready to eat. Pan-fried gy\u014dza are sold as a side dish in many ''[[ramen]]'' and [[Chuka (food)|Chinese restaurant]]s.\n\nThe most popular preparation method is the pan-fried style called ''yaki-gy\u014dza'' ({{lang|ja|\u713c\u304d\u9903\u5b50}}), in which the dumpling is first [[frying|fried]] on one flat side, creating a crispy skin. Then, water is added and the pan sealed with a lid, until the upper part of the dumpling is [[steaming|steamed]]. Other popular methods include [[boiled|boiling]] ''sui-gy\u014dza'' ({{lang|ja|\u6c34\u9903\u5b50}}) and [[deep frying]] ''age-gy\u014dza'' ({{lang|ja|\u63da\u3052\u9903\u5b50}}).\n\nStore-bought frozen dumplings are often prepared at home by first placing them in a pot of water, bringing it to a boil, and then transferring them to a pan with oil to fry the skin.\n\n====History====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Momo===\n{{Main|Momo (dumpling)}}\nThe Tibetan version is known as [[Momo (dumpling)|momo]] ([[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]]: \u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b) The word \"momo\" comes from a Chinese [[loanword]], \"momo\" ([[wikt:\u9943\u9943|\u9943\u9943]]),<ref>J\u012bn P\u00e9ng \u91d1\u9e4f (ed.): ''Z\u00e0ngy\u01d4 ji\u01cenzh\u00ec'' \u85cf\u8bed\u7b80\u5fd7.

Jiaozi have a thicker skin and a relatively flatter, more oblate, double-saucer like shape, and are usually eaten with a soy-vinegar [[dipping sauce]] (and/or hot [[chili sauce]]), while wontons have thinner skin and are usually served in broth. The dough for the jiaozi and wonton wrappers also consist of different ingredients.\n\n==See also==\n{{Cookbook|Potsticker}}\n{{Commons|Jiaozi}}\n{{Portal|Food|Asia}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Baozi]] \u2013 Chinese stuffed yeast bun\n*[[Jiucai Hezi|Jiucai hezi]] \u2013 Chinese chive pockets\n*[[Buuz]], [[khuushuur]], [[Cuisine of Mongolia|bansh]] \u2013 Mongolian\n*[[Empanada]] \u2013 Spanish\n*[[Khinkali]] \u2013 Georgian\n*[[Kreplach]] \u2013 Jewish\n*[[Mandu (dumpling)|Mandu]] \u2013 Korean\n*[[Manti (dumpling)|Manti]] \u2013 Turkic\n*[[G\u00fcrz\u0259]] - Azerbaijani\n*[[Pelmeni]] \u2013 Russian\n*[[Pierogi]] \u2013 Polish\n*[[Ravioli]] \u2013 Italian\n*[[Tortellini]] \u2013 Italian\n*[[Varenyky]] \u2013 Ukrainian\n*[[List of Chinese dishes]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cantonese cuisine}}\n{{Hakka cuisine}}\n{{Shanghai cuisine}}\n{{Chinese New Year}}\n{{Dumplings}}\n{{Street food}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:American Chinese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Appetizers]]\n[[Category:Beijing cuisine]]\n[[Category:Canadian Chinese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Cantonese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Chinese inventions]]\n[[Category:Chinese New Year foods]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Dim sum]]\n[[Category:Dumplings]]\n[[Category:Fried foods]]\n[[Category:Hakka cuisine]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong cuisine]]\n[[Category:Japanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Massachusetts cuisine]]\n[[Category:New England cuisine]]\n[[Category:Northeastern Chinese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Shanghai cuisine]]\n[[Category:Steamed foods]]\n[[Category:Street food]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Teochew cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGuotie:clean up, replaced: (Chinese: \u2192 ({{zh|links=no|c=", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi"}
