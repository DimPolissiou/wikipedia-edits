period of {{convert|15\u201316|h|d|abbr=off}} has not been yet been ruled out, due to projection effects of radar images.<ref name=\"naic\"/> Radar observations by Arecibo suggest the satellite is likely [[tidally locked]] to the primary body, with its rotation period being [[synchronous rotation|synchronous]] with its orbital period.<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"Becker2020\"/> However, uncertainties remain in measurements of the satellite's rotation period, thus an upper limit to its period was placed at 49 hours.<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"johnston\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes

It was discovered on 27 January 2020, by the [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] survey at the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] in [[Hawaii]]. The asteroid was discovered during its close approach to Earth from a nominal distance of 11.35 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]s, or approximately {{convert|4.36|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}. [[Radar astronomy|radar]] observations of the asteroid were carried out, revealing a small [[natural satellite]] orbiting {{cvt|360|m|ft}} from the primary body.<ref name=\"johnston\"/> The discovery of the satellite was announced by the [[Arecibo Observatory]] on 10 February 2020.<ref name=\"naic\"/>\n\n== Discovery ==\n{{mp|2020 BX|12}} was discovered on 27 January 2020, by the [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS) survey at the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] in [[Hawaii]]. The ATLAS survey was designed for detecting [[near-Earth asteroid]]s on approach to Earth, particularly those that may be considered [[potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous]] under circumstances where they can approach Earth from close distances.<ref name=\"Tonry2018\"/> {{mp|2020 BX|12}} was identified by a team of astronomers consisting of Larry Denneau, John Tonry, Aren Heinze, and Henry Weiland, who were chiefly involved in the ATLAS project.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-B281\"/><ref name=\"Tonry2018\"/> The asteroid was discovered during its approach to Earth, and was at nominal distance of about {{convert|0.11|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}} from the planet.<ref name=\"NEODyS-Eph-Dis\"/> At the time of discovery, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} was located in the [[constellation (astronomy)|constellation]] of [[Puppis (constellation)|Puppis]] at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 17.6.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-B281\"/>{{efn|The [[celestial coordinates]] of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} at the time of discovery were  {{RA|07|34|48.39}} {{Dec|-38|14|23.2}}.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-B281\"/> See [[Puppis (constellation)|Puppis]] for constellation coordinates.}}\n\nThe discovery of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} was subsequently reported to the [[Minor Planet Center]]'s near-Earth object confirmation page (NEOCP), where a preliminary orbit was calculated from additional observations conducted at multiple observatories.<ref name=\"PseudoMPEC\"/> Follow-up observations of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} spanned three days since its discovery, and the asteroid was formally announced in a [[Minor Planet Electronic Circular]] issued by the Minor Planet Center on 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-B281\"/>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nUpon discovery, the asteroid was given the temporary internal designation A10jUnf.<ref name=\"NEO-Exchange\"/> After follow up observations confirming the object, it was then given the [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2020 BX|12}} by the Minor Planet Center on 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-B281\"/> The provisional designation signifies the object's discovery date and year.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/> Although {{mp|2020 BX|12}} has a sufficiently long [[observation arc]] for its orbit to be accurately determined,<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-C132\"/> the asteroid has not yet been issued a permanent [[minor planet number]] by the Minor Planet Center due to it being only recently discovered. Once the Minor Planet Center assigns a minor planet number for {{mp|2020 BX|12}}, it will be eligible for naming.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/>\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n{{mp|2020 BX|12}} orbits the [[Sun]] at an average distance of approximately {{convert|1.60|AU|e9km e9mi|abbr=out|lk=in|sigfig=3}}, taking 2.02 years to complete one full orbit. The orbit of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} is highly eccentric and inclined to the [[ecliptic]] plane: it has an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.757 and [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 40 degrees, with its orbit extending from 0.76&nbsp;AU at [[perihelion]] to 2.44&nbsp;AU at [[aphelion]]. As it approaches perihelion, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} moves above the ecliptic and comes closer to the Sun than [[Venus]], whereas at aphelion, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} moves below the ecliptic and recedes from the Sun farther out than the orbit of [[Mars]]. The orbit of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} crosses that of Earth's, thus it can occasionally make close approaches to the planet, making it a [[near-Earth object]]. With a [[semi-major axis]] (average orbit distance) greater than 1&nbsp;AU and a perihelion distance within that of Earth's, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} is formally classified under the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] of near-Earth asteroids.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/><ref name=\"MPC-object\"/>\n[[File:2020 BX12 orbit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Side view of {{mp|2020 BX|12}}'s inclined orbit]]\n\nThe asteroid's [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] (MOID) from Earth is approximately {{convert|0.002|AU|e6km e6mi|abbr=unit}}, or about 0.78 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]s.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/> Having such a small Earth MOID, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} is considered a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] (PHA) by the Minor Planet Center, under the definition that PHAs have Earth MOIDs less than 0.05&nbsp;AU and [[absolute magnitude]]s under 22.<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/><ref name=\"PHA-def\"/> Despite this, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} will not make any close Earth encounters within 15 lunar distances or {{convert|0.04|AU|e6km e6mi|abbr=unit}} over the next 200 years,<ref name=\"jpldata\"/><ref name=\"Starr2020\"/> and the asteroid has not been listed by the JPL [[Sentry Risk Table]] {{asof|2020|lc=y}}.<ref name=\"CNEOS\"/>\n\nOn 12 February 2020, a team of astronomers identified {{mp|2020 BX|12}} in several [[precovery]] images taken by the [[Pan-STARRS 1]] survey, with the earliest images dating back to 5 January 2014.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-C132\"/> The observation arc of these precovery images spanned over six years, long enough for astronomers to refine and calculate {{mp|2020 BX|12}}'s orbit with accuracy.<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/> This greatly reduced uncertainties in the asteroid's orbit, reducing its [[uncertainty parameter]] from 8 to 1.<ref name=\"MPEC-2020-B281\"/><ref name=\"MPEC-2020-C132\"/> {{Asof|February 2020}} the observation arc of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} spans 6.09 years or 2,224 days, and its orbit has an uncertainty parameter of 0 according to the [[JPL Small-Body Database]].<ref name=\"jpldata\"/>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n=== 2020 Earth approach ===\nOn 3 February 2020 at 18:56&nbsp;[[UTC]], {{mp|2020 BX|12}} passed {{convert|0.02915|AU|e6km e6mi|abbr=unit|sigfig=3}}, or 11.35 lunar distances, from Earth.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/> During its close approach to Earth, the asteroid approached Earth at a rate of {{cvt|25.3|km/s|mph}} and its apparent visual brightness peaked around magnitude 15.7, which is too faint to be seen with the naked eye.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/><ref name=\"NEODyS-Eph\"/> At closest approach the asteroid's apparent motion in the sky was 1.2 degrees per hour and was in the constellation of [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]], at an apparent magnitude of 16 and an [[angular separation]] of 20 degrees from the [[Moon]].<ref name=\"NEODyS-Eph\"/>{{efn|The celestial coordinates of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} at 19:00&nbsp;UTC are {{RA|03|08|29.788}} {{Dec|+05|03|41.65}}.<ref name=\"NEODyS-Eph\"/> See [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]] for constellation coordinates.}}\n\nThe February 2020 encounter by {{mp|2020 BX|12}} provided an opportunity for [[radar astronomy|radar]] observatories to study the asteroid's characteristics in detail. {{mp|2020 BX|12}} was the first radar target observed by the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]] since the one-month shutdown of observatory operations due to a series of [[earthquake]]s that have occurred in the southern region of Puerto Rico during December 2019 and January 2020.<ref name=\"Bartels2020\"/> Radar observations of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} were conducted on 4 February 2020 by a team of astronomers led by Luisa Zambrano-Mar\u00edn.<ref name=\"Becker2020\"/> Over a two-day observation period, astronomers measured the asteroid's size, shape, and rotation, along with the discovery of a small orbiting satellite.<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"Starr2020\"/>\n\n=== Future approaches ===\nOver the course of its orbit in the next 200 years, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} will continue to pass by Earth, though it will not make any approaches as close as the February 2020 encounter that would otherwise warrant attention. The last Earth encounter by {{mp|2020 BX|12}} from a closer distance was on 1 February 1931, when the asteroid approached Earth from a distance of {{convert|0.009|AU|e6km e6mi|abbr=unit}}, or 3.5 lunar distances.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/><ref name=\"Guarino2020\"/> As {{mp|2020 BX|12}} begins its approach to aphelion after its perihelion passage on 21 March 2020, the asteroid will approach Mars on 28 June 2020, from a distance of {{convert|0.042|AU|e6km e6mi|abbr=unit}}.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/><ref name=\"Starr2020\"/> The next two Earth encounters by {{mp|2020 BX|12}} will occur in February 2022 and 2024, with approach distances of 0.18&nbsp;AU and 0.34&nbsp;AU, respectively.<ref name=\"jpldata\"/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nIn Arecibo delay-[[Doppler radar]] observations from 4 January to 5 January 2020, {{mp|2020 BX|12}} was resolved at a resolution of 7.5&nbsp;meters&nbsp;per&nbsp;pixel, allowing for direct measurements of the asteroid's physical properties.<ref name=\"naic\"/> Radar images show that {{mp|2020 BX|12}} is at least {{cvt|165|m|ft}} in diameter, implying a [[geometric albedo]] or reflectivity of 0.30 given its [[absolute magnitude]] of 20.6.<ref name=\"johnston\"/> {{mp|2020 BX|12}} appears to have a nearly [[spheroid]]al shape, which is commonly observed in other near-Earth objects such as {{mpl-|308635|2005 YU|55}} and [[101955 Bennu]].<ref name=\"Becker2020\"/><ref name=\"Taylor2012\"/> The rotation of {{mp|2020 BX|12}} has not been fully observed in detail due to radar projection effects, thus only constraints on its rotation period can be made.

{{cvt|360|m|ft}},<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"Starr2020\"/> or 4.4 times the radius of the {{mp|2020 BX|12}} primary.<ref name=\"johnston\"/> The orbital period of the satellite is thought to be around {{convert|45\u201350|h|d|abbr=off}}, with the best-fit period being {{convert|1.96|d|h|order=flip|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"johnston\"/> However, another possible orbital period of {{convert|15\u201316|h|d|abbr=off}} has not been yet been ruled out, due to projection effects of radar images.<ref name=\"naic\"/> Radar observations by Arecibo suggest the satellite is likely [[tidally locked]] to the primary body, with its rotation period being [[synchronous rotation|synchronous]] with its orbital period.<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"Becker2020\"/> However, uncertainties remain in measurements of the satellite's rotation period, thus an upper limit to its period was placed at 49 hours.<ref name=\"naic\"/><ref name=\"johnston\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes

After earning his diploma in 1921, he enrolled in the department of engineering, but in November, 1923 changed to mathematics. Immediately after earning his [[laurea]], in 1925, he became the assistant of [[Mauro Picone]], who in that year was called to the [[University of Naples]], where he remained until 1932. Picone immediately discovered Caccioppoli's gifts and pointed him towards research in [[mathematical analysis]]. In the course of the next five years, Caccioppoli published about thirty works on topics developed in the complete autonomy provided by a ministerial award for mathematics in 1931, a competition he won at the age of 27 and the chair of algebraic analysis at the [[University of Padova]]. In 1934 he returned to Naples to accept the chair in [[group theory]]; later he took the chair of superior analysis, and from 1943 onwards, the chair in mathematical analysis.\n\nIn 1931 he became a correspondent member of the Academy of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of Naples, becoming an ordinary member in 1938. In 1944 he became an ordinary member of the [[Accademia Pontaniana]], and in 1947 a correspondent member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], and a national member in 1958. He was also a correspondent member of the [[Accademia Galileiana|Paduan Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts]]. In the years from 1947 to 1957 he directed, together with [[Carlo Miranda]], the journal ''Giornale di Matematiche'', founded by [[Giuseppe Battaglini]]. In 1948 he became a member of the editing committee of ''Annali di Matematica'', and starting in 1952 he was also a member of the editing committee of ''Ricerche di Matematica''. In 1953 the Academia dei Lincei bestowed on him the national prize of physical, mathematical, and natural sciences.\n\nHe was an excellent [[pianist]], noted as well for his nonconformist temperament. He tried out the vagrant life, and was arrested for begging. In May 1938 he gave a speech against [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], when the latter was visiting Naples. Together with his companion Sara Mancuso, he had the French national [[anthem]] played by an orchestra, after which he began to speak against [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] in the presence of [[OVRA]] agents. He was again arrested, but his aunt, [[Maria Bakunin]], who at the time was a professor of chemistry at the [[University of Naples]], succeeded in having him released by convincing the authorities that her nephew was ''[[non compos mentis]]''. Thus Caccioppoli was interned, but he continued his studies in mathematics, and playing the piano.\n\nIn his last years, the disappointments of [[politics]] and his wife's desertion, together perhaps with the weakening of his mathematical vein, pushed him into [[alcoholism]]. His growing instability had sharpened his \"strangenesses\", to the point that the news of his suicide on May 8, 1959 by a gunshot to the head did not surprise those who knew him. He died at his home in [[Palazzo Cellammare, Naples|Palazzo Cellamare]].\n\n==Work==\nHis most important works, out of a total of around eighty publications, relate to [[functional analysis]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. Beginning in 1930 he dedicated himself to the study of [[differential equation]]s, the first to use a topological-functional approach. Proceeding in this way, in 1931 he extended the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], applying the results obtained both from ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.\n\nIn 1932 he introduced the general concept of inversion of functional correspondence, showing that a transformation between two [[Banach space]]s is invertible only if it is locally invertible and if the only convergent sequences are the compact ones.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1938 he applied his results to [[elliptic equation]]s, establishing the majorizing limits for their solutions, generalizing the two-dimensional case of [[Felix Bernstein (mathematician)|Felix Bernstein]]. At the same time he studied [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variables]], that is, analytic functions whose [[domain of a function|domain]] belongs to the vector space {{math|'''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, proving in 1933 the fundamental theorem on normal families of such functions: if a family is normal with respect to every complex variable, it is also normal with respect to the set of the variables. He also proved a [[Residue (complex analysis)|logarithmic residue]] formula for functions of two complex variables in 1949.\n\nIn 1935 Caccioppoli proved the analyticity of class {{math|''C''<sup>2</sup>}} solutions of elliptic equations with analytic coefficients.\n\nThe year 1952 saw the publication of his masterwork on the area of a surface and [[measure theory]], the article ''Measure and integration of dimensionally oriented sets'' (''Misura e integrazione degli insiemi dimensionalmente orientati'', Rendiconti dell'[[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], s. VIII, v.12). The article is mainly concerned with the theory of dimensionally oriented sets; that is, an interpretation of surfaces as oriented boundaries of sets in space. Also in this paper, the family of sets approximable by polygonal domains of finite perimeter, known today as [[Caccioppoli set]]s or [[Caccioppoli set|sets of finite perimeter]], was introduced and studied.\n\nHis last works, produced between 1952 and 1953, deal with a class of [[pseudoanalytic function]]s, introduced by him to extend certain properties of [[analytic function]]s.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1992 his tormented personality inspired the plot of a film directed by [[Mario Martone]], ''[[Morte di un matematico napoletano|The Death of a Neapolitan Mathematician]]'' (''[[Morte di un matematico napoletano]]''), in which he was portrayed by [[Carlo Cecchi]].\n\nAn [[asteroid]], [[9934 Caccioppoli]], has been named after him.\n\n==Selected publications==\n*{{Citation\n|last = Caccioppoli\n|first = Renato\n|title = Opere scelte\n|place = [[Rome|Roma]]\n|publisher = Edizioni Cremonese (distributed by [[Unione Matematica Italiana]])\n|year = 1963\n|volume =\n|url = \n|doi = \n|zbl = 0112.28201\n|isbn = \n}} {{ISBN|88-7083-505-7}} (Volume 1) AND {{ISBN|88-7083-506-5}} (Volume 2).

After earning his diploma in 1921, he enrolled in the department of engineering, but in November, 1923 changed to mathematics. Immediately after earning his [[laurea]], in 1925, he became the assistant of [[Mauro Picone]], who in that year was called to the [[University of Naples]], where he remained until 1932. Picone immediately discovered Caccioppoli's gifts and pointed him towards research in [[mathematical analysis]]. In the course of the next five years, Caccioppoli published about thirty works on topics developed in the complete autonomy provided by a ministerial award for mathematics in 1931, a competition he won at the age of 27 and the chair of algebraic analysis at the [[University of Padova]]. In 1934 he returned to Naples to accept the chair in [[group theory]]; later he took the chair of superior analysis, and from 1943 onwards, the chair in mathematical analysis.\n\nIn 1931 he became a correspondent member of the Academy of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of Naples, becoming an ordinary member in 1938. In 1944 he became an ordinary member of the [[Accademia Pontaniana]], and in 1947 a correspondent member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], and a national member in 1958. He was also a correspondent member of the [[Accademia Galileiana|Paduan Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts]]. In the years from 1947 to 1957 he directed, together with [[Carlo Miranda]], the journal ''Giornale di Matematiche'', founded by [[Giuseppe Battaglini]]. In 1948 he became a member of the editing committee of ''Annali di Matematica'', and starting in 1952 he was also a member of the editing committee of ''Ricerche di Matematica''. In 1953 the Academia dei Lincei bestowed on him the national prize of physical, mathematical, and natural sciences.\n\nHe was an excellent [[pianist]], noted as well for his nonconformist temperament. He tried out the vagrant life, and was arrested for begging. In May 1938 he gave a speech against [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], when the latter was visiting Naples. Together with his companion Sara Mancuso, he had the French national [[anthem]] played by an orchestra, after which he began to speak against [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] in the presence of [[OVRA]] agents. He was again arrested, but his aunt, [[Maria Bakunin]], who at the time was a professor of chemistry at the [[University of Naples]], succeeded in having him released by convincing the authorities that her nephew was ''[[non compos mentis]]''. Thus Caccioppoli was interned, but he continued his studies in mathematics, and playing the piano.\n\nIn his last years, the disappointments of [[politics]] and his wife's desertion, together perhaps with the weakening of his mathematical vein, pushed him into [[alcoholism]]. His growing instability had sharpened his \"strangenesses\", to the point that the news of his suicide on May 8, 1959 by a gunshot to the head did not surprise those who knew him. He died at his home in [[Palazzo Cellammare, Naples|Palazzo Cellamare]].\n\n==Work==\nHis most important works, out of a total of around eighty publications, relate to [[functional analysis]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. Beginning in 1930 he dedicated himself to the study of [[differential equation]]s, the first to use a topological-functional approach. Proceeding in this way, in 1931 he extended the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], applying the results obtained both from ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.\n\nIn 1932 he introduced the general concept of inversion of functional correspondence, showing that a transformation between two [[Banach space]]s is invertible only if it is locally invertible and if the only convergent sequences are the compact ones.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1938 he applied his results to [[elliptic equation]]s, establishing the majorizing limits for their solutions, generalizing the two-dimensional case of [[Felix Bernstein (mathematician)|Felix Bernstein]]. At the same time he studied [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variables]], i.e. analytic functions whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] belongs to the vector space {{math|'''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, proving in 1933 the fundamental theorem on normal families of such functions: if a family is normal with respect to every complex variable, it is also normal with respect to the set of the variables. He also proved a [[Residue (complex analysis)|logarithmic residue]] formula for functions of two complex variables in 1949.\n\nIn 1935 Caccioppoli proved the analyticity of class {{math|''C''<sup>2</sup>}} solutions of elliptic equations with analytic coefficients.\n\nThe year 1952 saw the publication of his masterwork on the area of a surface and [[measure theory]], the article ''Measure and integration of dimensionally oriented sets'' (''Misura e integrazione degli insiemi dimensionalmente orientati'', Rendiconti dell'[[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], s. VIII, v.12). The article is mainly concerned with the theory of dimensionally oriented sets; that is, an interpretation of surfaces as oriented boundaries of sets in space. Also in this paper, the family of sets approximable by polygonal domains of finite perimeter, known today as [[Caccioppoli set]]s or [[Caccioppoli set|sets of finite perimeter]], was introduced and studied.\n\nHis last works, produced between 1952 and 1953, deal with a class of [[pseudoanalytic function]]s, introduced by him to extend certain properties of [[analytic function]]s.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1992 his tormented personality inspired the plot of a film directed by [[Mario Martone]], ''[[Morte di un matematico napoletano|The Death of a Neapolitan Mathematician]]'' (''[[Morte di un matematico napoletano]]''), in which he was portrayed by [[Carlo Cecchi]].\n\nAn [[asteroid]], [[9934 Caccioppoli]], has been named after him.\n\n==Selected publications==\n*{{Citation\n|last = Caccioppoli\n|first = Renato\n|title = Opere scelte\n|place = [[Rome|Roma]]\n|publisher = Edizioni Cremonese (distributed by [[Unione Matematica Italiana]])\n|year = 1963\n|volume =\n|url = \n|doi = \n|zbl = 0112.28201\n|isbn = \n}} {{ISBN|88-7083-505-7}} (Volume 1) AND {{ISBN|88-7083-506-5}} (Volume 2).

Within each of these groups, records are defined for speed over a straight course and for closed circuits of various sizes carrying various payloads.\n\n==Timeline==\n\n[[File:Flight airspeed records over time.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Flight speed records over time, taken from the table below.]]\nRecords in <span style=\"color:gray\">\"gray\" font color</span> are unofficial, including unconfirmed or unpublicized (wartime) secrets.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Date\n! width=\"12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Pilot\n! colspan=\"3\" | Airspeed\n! width=\"15%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n! width=\"25%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | mph\n! width=\"5%\" | km/h\n! width=\"15%\" | Aircraft\n|-\n| 17 December 1903 || [[Wilbur Wright]] || 6.82 || 10.98 || [[Wright Flyer]] || [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], North Carolina, US || This figure is groundspeed, not airspeed.

The record was set on 28 July 1976 by [[Eldon W. Joersz]] and George T. Morgan Jr. near Beale Air Force Base, [[California]], [[United States|USA]]. It was capable of taking off and landing unassisted on conventional runways.<ref>{{cite web\n|url         = http://records.fai.org/general_aviation/current.asp?id1=21&id2=4\n|title       = Current air speed record\n|accessdate  = 18 October 2006\n|url-status     = dead\n|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002329/http://records.fai.org/general_aviation/current.asp?id1=21&id2=4\n|archivedate = 27 September 2007\n|df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> SR-71 pilot [[Brian Shul]] claimed in ''The Untouchables'' that he flew in excess of Mach 3.5 on 15 April 1986, over Libya, in order to avoid a missile.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shul|first=Brian|title=The Untouchables|year=1994|publisher=Mach One|isbn=0929823125|page=173}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the official record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight was held by a [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], the ''Rare Bear'', with a speed of 850.24&nbsp;km/h (528.31&nbsp;mph), the unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a British [[Hawker Sea Fury]] at 880&nbsp;km/h (547&nbsp;mph). Whereas these were both demilitarised, modified fighters, the fastest piston-engined aeroplane in stock (original, factory-built) condition was the German [[Dornier Do 335]] Pfeil, with a maximum speed of 765&nbsp;km/h (474&nbsp;mph) in level flight. The unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane (not in level flight) is held by a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk XIX, which was calculated to have achieved a speed of 1,110&nbsp;km/h (690&nbsp;mph, Mach 0.96) in a dive on 5 February 1952.\n\nThe last new speed record ratified before the outbreak of [[World War II]] was set on 26 April 1939 with a [[Messerschmitt Me 209|Me 209]] V1, at 755&nbsp;km/h (469&nbsp;mph). The chaos, and secrecy, of World War II meant that new speed breakthroughs were not publicized nor ratified. In October 1941, an unofficial speed record of 1004&nbsp;km/h (624&nbsp;mph) was secretly set by a [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Me 163 A|Messerschmitt Me 163]] AV4 rocket aircraft. Continued research during the war extended the secret, unofficial speed record to 1130&nbsp;km/h (702&nbsp;mph) by July 1944, achieved by a [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|Messerschmitt Me 163]]B V18. The first new official record in the post-war period was achieved by a [[Gloster Meteor]] in November 1945, at 976&nbsp;km/h (606&nbsp;mph). The first aircraft to exceed the unofficial October 1941 record of the Me 163 AV4 was the [[Douglas Skystreak]], which achieved 1031&nbsp;km/h (641&nbsp;mph) in August 1947. The July 1944 unofficial record of the Me 163B V18 was officially surpassed in November 1947, when Chuck Yeager flew the [[Bell X-1]] to 1434&nbsp;km/h (891&nbsp;mph).\n\nThe official speed record for a [[seaplane]] moved by piston engine - still valid today - is 709.209&nbsp;km/h, from the seaplane (\"idrocorsa\") Macchi-Castoldi [[M.C.72]], attained on 23 October 1934, by [[Francesco Agello]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/archiviovetrine_news/Pagine/Agelloprimatovelocita.aspx\n|title       = Agello Airspeed record, Air Force portal\n|accessdate  = 31 August 2015\n|url-status     = dead\n|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033802/http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/archiviovetrine_news/Pagine/Agelloprimatovelocita.aspx\n|archivedate = 4 March 2016\n|df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> It was equipped with the [[Fiat AS.6]] engine (version 1934) developing a power of {{cvt|3100|hp|kW|order=flip}} at 3300 rpm, with coaxial counter-rotating propellers.

Speed records are divided into multiple classes with sub-divisions. There are three classes of aircraft: landplanes, [[seaplane]]s, and [[amphibious aircraft|amphibians]]; then within these classes, there are records for aircraft in a number of weight categories. There are still further subdivisions for piston-engined, [[turbojet]], [[turboprop]], and rocket-engined aircraft. Within each of these groups, records are defined for speed over a straight course and for closed circuits of various sizes carrying various payloads.\n\n==Timeline==\n\n[[File:Flight airspeed records over time.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Flight speed records over time, taken from the table below.]]\nRecords in <span style=\"color:gray\">\"gray\" font color</span> are unofficial, including unconfirmed or unpublicized (wartime) secrets.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Date\n! width=\"12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Pilot\n! colspan=\"3\" | Airspeed\n! width=\"15%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n! width=\"25%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | mph\n! width=\"5%\" | km/h\n! width=\"15%\" | Aircraft\n|-\n| 17 December 1903 || [[Wilbur Wright]] || 6.82 || 10.98 || [[Wright Flyer]] || [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], North Carolina, US || This figure is groundspeed, not airspeed.

The record was set on 28 July 1976 by [[Eldon W. Joersz]] and George T. Morgan Jr. near Beale Air Force Base, [[California]], [[United States|USA]].

Whereas these were both demilitarised, modified fighters, the fastest piston-engined aeroplane in stock (original, factory-built) condition was the German [[Dornier Do 335]] Pfeil, with a maximum speed of 765&nbsp;km/h (474&nbsp;mph) in level flight. The unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane (not in level flight) is held by a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk XIX, which was calculated to have achieved a speed of 1,110&nbsp;km/h (690&nbsp;mph, Mach 0.96) in a dive on 5 February 1952.\n\nThe last new speed record ratified before the outbreak of [[World War II]] was set on 26 April 1939 with a [[Messerschmitt Me 209|Me 209]] V1, at 755&nbsp;km/h (469&nbsp;mph). The chaos, and secrecy, of World War II meant that new speed breakthroughs were not publicized nor ratified. In October 1941, an unofficial speed record of 1004&nbsp;km/h (624&nbsp;mph) was secretly set by a [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Me 163 A|Messerschmitt Me 163]] AV4 rocket aircraft. Continued research during the war extended the secret, unofficial speed record to 1130&nbsp;km/h (702&nbsp;mph) by July 1944, achieved by a [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|Messerschmitt Me 163]]B V18. The first new official record in the post-war period was achieved by a [[Gloster Meteor]] in November 1945, at 976&nbsp;km/h (606&nbsp;mph). The first aircraft to exceed the unofficial October 1941 record of the Me 163 AV4 was the [[Douglas Skystreak]], which achieved 1031&nbsp;km/h (641&nbsp;mph) in August 1947. The July 1944 unofficial record of the Me 163B V18 was officially surpassed in November 1947, when Chuck Yeager flew the [[Bell X-1]] to 1434&nbsp;km/h (891&nbsp;mph).\n\nThe official speed record for a [[seaplane]] moved by piston engine - still valid today - is 709.209&nbsp;km/h, from the seaplane (\"idrocorsa\") Macchi-Castoldi [[M.C.72]], attained on 23 October 1934, by [[Francesco Agello]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/archiviovetrine_news/Pagine/Agelloprimatovelocita.aspx\n|title       = Agello Airspeed record, Air Force portal\n|accessdate  = 31 August 2015\n|url-status     = dead\n|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033802/http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/archiviovetrine_news/Pagine/Agelloprimatovelocita.aspx\n|archivedate = 4 March 2016\n|df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> It was equipped with the [[Fiat AS.6]] engine (version 1934) developing a power of {{cvt|3100|hp|kW|order=flip}} at 3300 rpm, with coaxial counter-rotating propellers.

Typically, the first year of growth produces a mound of foliage, and flowering occurs the second year; the plants are normally [[Biennial plant|biennial]]s, but a number of races can be short-lived [[perennial]]s. The plants have showy blooms in early to mid spring. The leaves are alternately arranged on upright stems and [[Leaf shape|lanceolate-shaped]]; they typically have very short or lack [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] and have toothed margins, but sometimes are entire and are widest at the base. The foliage has short hairs on the top and bottom surfaces that give the leaves a somewhat rough feel. The larger leaves are around 12&nbsp;cm long and over 4&nbsp;cm wide. In early spring, a thick mound of low-growing foliage is produced; during flowering the lower parts of the stems are generally unbranched and denuded of foliage and the top of the blooming plant might have a few branches that end in [[inflorescence]]s.\n\nThe plentiful, fragrant flowers are produced in large, showy, terminal [[raceme]]s that can be 30+&nbsp;cm tall and elongate as the flowers of the inflorescence bloom. When stems have both flowers and fruits, the weight sometimes causes the stems to bend. Each flower is large (2&nbsp;cm across), with four [[petal]]s. Flower coloration varies, with different shades of lavender and purple most common, but white, pink, and even some flowers with mixed colors exist in cultivated forms. A few different double-flowered varieties also exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/homegardening/scenecd89.html|title=Explore Cornell - Home Gardening - Flower Growing Guides - Growing Guide|website=www.gardening.cornell.edu}}</ref>  The four petals are clawed and hairless. The flowers have six [[stamen]]s in two groups, the four closest to the ovary are longer than the two oppositely positioned. [[Gynoecium|Stigma]]s are two-lobed. The four [[sepal]]s are erect and form a mock tube around the claws of the petals and are also colored similarly to the petals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missouriplants.com/Bluealt/Hesperis_matronalis_page.html|title=Hesperis matronalis page|website=www.missouriplants.com}}</ref>\n\nSome plants may bloom until August, but warm weather greatly shortens the duration on each flower's blooming. Seeds are produced in thin fruits 5\u201314&nbsp;cm long pods, containing two rows of seeds separated by a dimple. The fruit are [[wikt:terete|terete]] and open by way of [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]] valves, constricted between the seeds like a pea pod. Seeds are oblong, 3\u20134&nbsp;mm long and 1\u20131.5&nbsp;mm wide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200009560|title=Hesperis matronalis in Flora of China @ efloras.org|website=www.efloras.org}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, ''Hesperis matronalis'' is often confused with native ''[[Phlox]]'' species that also have similar large showy flower clusters.  They can be distinguished from each other by foliage and flower differences: dame's rocket has alternately arranged leaves and four petals per flower, while phloxes have opposite leaves and five petals.\n\n[[File:Dame's rocket2.jpg|right|thumb|Stand of dame's rocket in a forested setting]]\n[[File:Sweet Rocket Whitelands.jpg|right|thumb|Naturalized Sweet Rocket, Whitelands Wood, Butser Hill, England]]\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Hesperis matronalis'' has been a cultivated species for a long time, and grows best in full sun to partial shade where soils are moist with good drainage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/plant.asp?code=D200|title=Help for the Home Gardener|website=www.mobot.org}}</ref> It is undemanding and self-seeds quickly, forming dense stands. Extensive monotypic stands of dame's rocket are visible from great distances; these dense collections of plants have the potential to crowd out native species when growing outside of cultivated areas.\n\nThe successful spread of dame's rocket in North America is attributed to its prolific seed production and because the seeds are often included in prepackaged \"wildflower seed\" mixes sold for \"naturalizing\". The plants typically produce a low-lying rosette of foliage the first year; in subsequent years, blooming and seed production occurs in tandem throughout the blooming season. This species is commonly found in roadside ditches, dumps and in open woodland settings, where it is noticed when in bloom. Although it makes an attractive, hardy garden plant, it has been found to be ecologically invasive in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/invasives/fact/damesrocket.html|title=Dame's rocket - Wisconsin DNR|website=dnr.wi.gov}}</ref>\n\n''Hesperis matronalis'' is propagated by seeds, but desirable individuals, including the double-flowering forms, are propagated from cuttings or division of the clumps.\n\n==Distribution==\nA garden escape, ''H. matronalis'' is found in many areas of Ireland,<ref>Scannell, M.

A few different double-flowered varieties also exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/homegardening/scenecd89.html|title=Explore Cornell - Home Gardening - Flower Growing Guides - Growing Guide|website=www.gardening.cornell.edu}}</ref>  The four petals are clawed and hairless. The flowers have six [[stamen]]s in two groups, the four closest to the ovary are longer than the two oppositely positioned. [[Gynoecium|Stigma]]s are two-lobed. The four [[sepal]]s are erect and form a mock tube around the claws of the petals and are also colored similarly to the petals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missouriplants.com/Bluealt/Hesperis_matronalis_page.html|title=Hesperis matronalis page|website=www.missouriplants.com}}</ref>\n\nSome plants may bloom until August, but warm weather greatly shortens the duration on each flower's blooming. Seeds are produced in thin fruits 5\u201314&nbsp;cm long pods, containing two rows of seeds separated by a dimple. The fruit are [[wikt:terete|terete]] and open by way of [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]] valves, constricted between the seeds like a pea pod. Seeds are oblong, 3\u20134&nbsp;mm long and 1\u20131.5&nbsp;mm wide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200009560|title=Hesperis matronalis in Flora of China @ efloras.org|website=www.efloras.org}}</ref>\n\nIn North America, ''Hesperis matronalis'' is often confused with native ''[[Phlox]]'' species that also have similar large showy flower clusters.  They can be distinguished from each other by foliage and flower differences: dame's rocket has alternately arranged leaves and four petals per flower, while phloxes have opposite leaves and five petals.\n\n[[File:Dame's rocket2.jpg|right|thumb|Stand of dame's rocket in a forested setting]]\n[[File:Sweet Rocket Whitelands.jpg|right|thumb|Naturalized Sweet Rocket, Whitelands Wood, Butser Hill, England]]\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Hesperis matronalis'' has been a cultivated species for a long time, and grows best in full sun to partial shade where soils are moist with good drainage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/plant.asp?code=D200|title=Help for the Home Gardener|website=www.mobot.org}}</ref> It is undemanding and self-seeds quickly, forming dense stands. Extensive monotypic stands of dame's rocket are visible from great distances; these dense collections of plants have the potential to crowd out native species when growing outside of cultivated areas.\n\nThe successful spread of dame's rocket in North America is attributed to its prolific seed production and because the seeds are often included in prepackaged \"wildflower seed\" mixes sold for \"naturalizing\". The plants typically produce a low-lying rosette of foliage the first year; in subsequent years, blooming and seed production occurs in tandem throughout the blooming season. This species is commonly found in roadside ditches, dumps and in open woodland settings, where it is noticed when in bloom. Although it makes an attractive, hardy garden plant, it has been found to be ecologically invasive in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/invasives/fact/damesrocket.html|title=Dame's rocket - Wisconsin DNR|website=dnr.wi.gov}}</ref>\n\n''Hesperis matronalis'' is propagated by seeds, but desirable individuals, including the double-flowering forms, are propagated from cuttings or division of the clumps.\n\n==Distribution==\nA garden escape, ''H. matronalis'' is found in many areas of Ireland,<ref>Scannell, M. J.P. and Synnott, D.M. (1972). \"Census Catalogue of the Flora of Ireland.\" Dublin: The Stationery Office</ref> including Belfast.<ref>Beesley, S. and Wilde, J. (1997). \"Urban Flora of Belfast\" The Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast</ref>\n\nDame's rocket was brought to North America in the 17th century and has since become naturalized there, now growing throughout most of the US and Canada. The US Department of Agriculture website has a map showing states and provinces in which the plant has been found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=HEMA3|title=Plants Profile for Hesperis matronalis (dames rocket)|website=plants.usda.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, it is host to the [[caterpillar]]s of several [[butterfly]] species, including the orange tip (''[[Anthocharis cardamines]]''), large white (''[[Pieris brassicae]]''), small white (''[[Pieris rapae]]''), and [[moth]]s, such as ''[[Plutella porrectella]]''.\n\n==Weediness==\n[[File:Damerocket.jpg|right|thumb|Flower detail]]\nIt is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas.
