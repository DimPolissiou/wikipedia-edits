Under his editorship, the committee produced a book called ''Language and Public Policy'' (1974), with the aim of informing readers of the extensive scope of doublespeak being used to deliberately mislead and deceive the audience. He highlighted the deliberate public misuses of language and provided strategies for countering doublespeak by focusing on educating people in the English language so as to help them identify when doublespeak is being put into play. He was also the founder of the Intensify/Downplay pattern that has been widely used to identify instances of doublespeak being used.<ref name=\"Robert S.Zais\"/>\n\n====Daniel Dieterich====\nDaniel Dieterich served as the second chairman of the Doublespeak committee after Hugh Rank in 1975.

In 1989, both his own book ''Doublespeak'' and, under his editorship, the committee's third book, ''Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four'', were published.

The NCTE's publications resonate with George Orwell's name, and allusions to him abound in statements on doublespeak; for example, the committee quoted Orwell's remark that \"language is often used as an instrument of social control\" in ''Language and Public Policy''. Tibbetts argues that such a relation between NCTE and Orwell's work is contradictory because \"the Committee's attitude towards language is liberal, even radical\" while \"Orwell's attitude was conservative, even reactionary\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\" /> He also criticizes the Committee's \"continual attack\" against linguistic \"[[Linguistic purism|purism]]\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\"/>\n\n== Modern uses ==\n\nWhereas in the early days of the practice it was considered wrong to construct words to disguise meaning, this is now an established practice. There is a thriving industry in constructing words without explicit meaning but with particular connotations for new products or companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doublespeak|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Doublespeak}}</ref> Doublespeak is also employed in the field of politics.\n\n=== In advertising ===\nAdvertisers can use doublespeak to mask their commercial intent from users, as users' defenses against advertising become more entrenched.<ref name=\"Walker Gibson\">{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Walker|title=Public Doublespeak: Doublespeak in Advertising|journal=The English Journal|date=February 1975|volume=64|issue=2}}</ref> Some are attempting to counter this technique with a number of systems offering diverse views and information to highlight the manipulative and dishonest methods that advertisers employ.<ref name=\"Sidney J.

Teachers of English should teach our students that words are not things, but verbal tokens or signs of things that should finally be carried back to the things that they stand for to be verified.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kehl|first=D.G|author2=Howard Livingston|title=Doublespeak Detection for the English Classroom|journal=The English Journal|date=July 1999|volume=88|issue=6}}</ref>\n\nAccording to William Lutz: \"Only by teaching respect and love for the language can teachers of English instill in students the sense of outrage they should experience when they encounter doublespeak.\"  \"Only by using language well will we come to appreciate the perversion inherent in doublespeak.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lutz|first=William|title=Fourteen Years of Doublespeak|journal=The English Journal|date=March 1988|volume=77|issue=3 |jstor=818411}}</ref>\n====Intensify/downplay pattern====\nThis pattern was formulated by Hugh Rank and is a simple tool designed to teach some basic patterns of persuasion used in political propaganda and commercial advertising.  The function of the intensify/downplay pattern is not to dictate what should be discussed but to encourage coherent thought and systematic organization. The pattern works in two ways: intensifying and downplaying. All people intensify and this is done via repetition, association and composition. Downplaying is commonly done via omission, diversion and confusion as they communicate in words, gestures, numbers, et cetera. Individuals can better cope with organized persuasion by recognizing the common ways whereby communication is intensified or downplayed, so as to counter doublespeak.<ref name=\"Hasselriis 1991 28\u201335\">{{cite journal|last=Hasselriis|first=Peter|date=February 1991|title=From Pearl Harbor to Watergate to Kuwait: \"Language in Thought and Action\"|journal=The English Journal|volume=80|issue=2|pages=28\u201335}}</ref>\n\n==== Doublespeak Award ====\n{{Main|Doublespeak Award}}\n\nDoublespeak is often used by politicians for the advancement of their agenda. The [[Doublespeak Award]] is an \"ironic tribute to public speakers who have perpetuated language that is grossly deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing, or self-centered.\" It has been issued by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (NCTE) since 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCTE: The Doublespeak Award|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups/publiclangcom/doublespeakaward}}</ref> The recipients of the Doublespeak Award are usually politicians, national administration or departments. An example of this is the United States Department of Defense, which won the award three times in 1991, 1993, and 2001. For the 1991 award, the United States Department of Defense \"swept the first six places in the Doublespeak top ten\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Tom|title=Rape trial deserved award for doublespeak|newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)|date=December 21, 1991}}</ref> for using euphemisms like \"servicing the target\" (bombing) and \"force packages\" (warplanes). Among the other phrases in contention were \"difficult exercise in labor relations\", meaning a strike, and \"meaningful downturn in aggregate output\", an attempt to avoid saying the word \"recession\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===In comedy===\n\nDoublespeak, particularly when exaggerated, can be used as a device in satirical comedy and social commentary to [[Irony|ironically]] parody political or bureaucratic establishments intent on obfuscation or prevarication.

Under his editorship, the committee produced a book called ''Language and Public Policy'' (1974), with the aim of informing readers of the extensive scope of doublespeak being used to deliberately mislead and deceive the audience. He highlighted the deliberate public misuses of language and provided strategies for countering doublespeak by focusing on educating people in the English language so as to help them identify when doublespeak is being put into play. He was also the founder of the Intensify/Downplay pattern that has been widely used to identify instances of doublespeak being used.<ref name=\"Robert S.Zais\"/>\n\n====Daniel Dieterich====\nDaniel Dieterich served as the second chairman of the Doublespeak committee after Hugh Rank in 1975. He served as editor of its second publication, ''Teaching about Doublespeak'' (1976), which carried forward the Committee's charge to inform teachers of ways of teaching students how to recognize and combat language designed to mislead and misinform.<ref name=\"Robert S.Zais\"/>{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?10449-1/doublespeak ''Booknotes'' interview with William Lutz on ''Doublespeak: The Use of Language to Deceive You''], December 31, 1989, [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\n==== William D. Lutz ====\n[[William D. Lutz]] has served as the third chairman of the Doublespeak Committee since 1975. In 1989, both his own book ''Doublespeak'' and, under his editorship, the committee's third book, ''Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four'', were published. ''Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four'' consists of 220 pages and eighteen articles contributed by long-time Committee members and others whose bodies of work have contributed to public understanding about language, as well as a bibliography of 103 sources on doublespeak.<ref name=\"Hasselriis 1991 28\u20133522\">{{cite journal|last=Hasselriis|first=Peter|date=February 1991|title=From Pearl Harbor to Watergate to Kuwait: \"Language in Thought and Action\"|journal=The English Journal|volume=80|issue=2|pages=28\u201335}}</ref> Lutz was also the former editor of the now defunct ''Quarterly Review of Doublespeak'', which examined the use of vocabulary by public officials to obscure the underlying meaning of what they tell the public. Lutz is one of the main contributors to the committee as well as promoting the term \"doublespeak\" to a mass audience to inform them of its deceptive qualities. He mentions:<ref name=\"William Lutz2\">{{cite news|title=A new look at 'doublespeak'|date=November 6, 1989|newspaper=Advertising Age|ref=harv}}</ref>{{quote|There is more to being an effective consumer of language than just expressing dismay at dangling modifiers, faulty subject and verb agreement, or questionable usage. All who use language should be concerned whether statements and facts agree, whether language is, in Orwell's words, \"largely the defense of the indefensible\" and whether language \"is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\".|sign=|source=}}\n\n====Criticism of NCTE====\nA. M. Tibbetts is one of the main critics of the NCTE, claiming that \"the Committee's very approach to the misuse of language and what it calls 'doublespeak' may in the long run limit its usefulness\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\">{{cite journal|last=Tibbetts|first=A.M.|title=A Case of Confusion: The NCTE Committee on Public Doublespeak|journal=College English|date=December 1978|volume=40|issue=4|pages=407\u201312}}</ref> According to him, the \"Committee's use of Orwell is both confused and confusing\". The NCTE's publications resonate with George Orwell's name, and allusions to him abound in statements on doublespeak; for example, the committee quoted Orwell's remark that \"language is often used as an instrument of social control\" in ''Language and Public Policy''. Tibbetts argues that such a relation between NCTE and Orwell's work is contradictory because \"the Committee's attitude towards language is liberal, even radical\" while \"Orwell's attitude was conservative, even reactionary\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\" /> He also criticizes the Committee's \"continual attack\" against linguistic \"[[Linguistic purism|purism]]\".<ref name=\"A.M.Tibbetts\"/>\n\n== Modern uses ==\n\nWhereas in the early days of the practice it was considered wrong to construct words to disguise meaning, this is now an established practice. There is a thriving industry in constructing words without explicit meaning but with particular connotations for new products or companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doublespeak|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Doublespeak}}</ref> Doublespeak is also employed in the field of politics.\n\n=== In advertising ===\nAdvertisers can use doublespeak to mask their commercial intent from users, as users' defenses against advertising become more entrenched.<ref name=\"Walker Gibson\">{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Walker|title=Public Doublespeak: Doublespeak in Advertising|journal=The English Journal|date=February 1975|volume=64|issue=2}}</ref> Some are attempting to counter this technique with a number of systems offering diverse views and information to highlight the manipulative and dishonest methods that advertisers employ.<ref name=\"Sidney J.

Use of doublespeak in advertisements resulted in aspirin production rates rising by almost 50 percent from over 23 million pounds in 1960 to over 35 million pounds in 1970.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dieterich|first=Daniel J.|title=Public Doublespeak: Teaching about Language in the Marketplace|journal=College English|date=December 1974|volume=36|issue=4|pages=477\u201381}}</ref>\n\n==== Education against doublespeak ====\nCharles Weingartner, one of the founding members of the NCTE committee on Public Doublespeak mentioned: \"people do not know enough about the subject (the reality) to recognize that the language being used conceals, distorts, misleads. Teachers of English should teach our students that words are not things, but verbal tokens or signs of things that should finally be carried back to the things that they stand for to be verified.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kehl|first=D.G|author2=Howard Livingston|title=Doublespeak Detection for the English Classroom|journal=The English Journal|date=July 1999|volume=88|issue=6}}</ref>\n\nAccording to William Lutz: \"Only by teaching respect and love for the language can teachers of English instill in students the sense of outrage they should experience when they encounter doublespeak.\"  \"Only by using language well will we come to appreciate the perversion inherent in doublespeak.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lutz|first=William|title=Fourteen Years of Doublespeak|journal=The English Journal|date=March 1988|volume=77|issue=3 |jstor=818411}}</ref>\n====Intensify/downplay pattern====\nThis pattern was formulated by Hugh Rank and is a simple tool designed to teach some basic patterns of persuasion used in political propaganda and commercial advertising.  The function of the intensify/downplay pattern is not to dictate what should be discussed but to encourage coherent thought and systematic organization. The pattern works in two ways: intensifying and downplaying. All people intensify and this is done via repetition, association and composition. Downplaying is commonly done via omission, diversion and confusion as they communicate in words, gestures, numbers, et cetera. Individuals can better cope with organized persuasion by recognizing the common ways whereby communication is intensified or downplayed, so as to counter doublespeak.<ref name=\"Hasselriis 1991 28\u201335\">{{cite journal|last=Hasselriis|first=Peter|date=February 1991|title=From Pearl Harbor to Watergate to Kuwait: \"Language in Thought and Action\"|journal=The English Journal|volume=80|issue=2|pages=28\u201335}}</ref>\n\n==== Doublespeak Award ====\n{{Main|Doublespeak Award}}\n\nDoublespeak is often used by politicians for the advancement of their agenda. The [[Doublespeak Award]] is an \"ironic tribute to public speakers who have perpetuated language that is grossly deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing, or self-centered.\" It has been issued by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (NCTE) since 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCTE: The Doublespeak Award|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups/publiclangcom/doublespeakaward}}</ref> The recipients of the Doublespeak Award are usually politicians, national administration or departments. An example of this is the United States Department of Defense, which won the award three times in 1991, 1993, and 2001. For the 1991 award, the United States Department of Defense \"swept the first six places in the Doublespeak top ten\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Tom|title=Rape trial deserved award for doublespeak|newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec)|date=December 21, 1991}}</ref> for using euphemisms like \"servicing the target\" (bombing) and \"force packages\" (warplanes). Among the other phrases in contention were \"difficult exercise in labor relations\", meaning a strike, and \"meaningful downturn in aggregate output\", an attempt to avoid saying the word \"recession\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===In comedy===\n\nDoublespeak, particularly when exaggerated, can be used as a device in satirical comedy and social commentary to [[Irony|ironically]] parody political or bureaucratic establishments intent on obfuscation or prevarication. The television series ''[[Yes Minister]]'' is notable for its use of this device.{{sfn|Herron|2007|p=144}} [[Oscar Wilde]] was an early proponent of this device{{sfn|Killeen|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Bennett|2015}}{{sfn|Raby|1997}} and a significant influence on Orwell.{{sfn|Bennett|2015}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Aesopian language]]\n* [[Alternative facts]]\n* [[Business speak]]\n* [[Catachresis]]\n* [[Cognitive dissonance]]\n* [[Double bind]]\n* [[Double entendre]]\n* [[Double-talk]]\n* [[Doublespeak Award]]\n* [[Euphemism]]\n* [[Obscurantism]]\n* [[Polite fiction]]\n* [[Dog-whistle politics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book| last = Baar| first = James| title = Spinspeak II: The Dictionary Of Language Pollution| year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-4184-2742-9 }}\n*{{cite book| last1=Bennett| first1=Michael| title=Oscar Wilde's Society Plays |date=2015|publisher=Springer|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=w41MCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT17&lpg=PT17&dq=doublespeak+oscar+wilde&source=bl&ots=gF3l9xL6tY&sig=IQBPSA_WpRkttoLknOSqbuC2AAA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX5fmTyYzQAhXsyVQKHQQCAQoQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&q=doublespeak%20oscar%20wilde&f=false| accessdate = 3 November 2016|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Herman|first=Edward S.|authorlink=Edward S.

It is bordered by Kavalas avenue and Spyrou Patsi Street. To its east lies the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and to the west was the location of Plato's olive, whose remains are exhibited inside the main building of the University. The site is split in two by the Iera Odos (Sacred Way) which connects [[Athens]] and [[Eleusis]].\n\nIts buildings comprise a great number of auditoriums and laboratories, a library, computer rooms, agricultural facilities (arboretum, vineyard, experimental fields, flower garden, greenhouses, cowshed, sheep pen, chicken coop, dairy installations, and aquaculture tanks), museums, student center, indoor gym, and sports fields.<ref name=\"AUA Campus\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.aua.gr/en/node/299 |title=The AUA campus and farms |publisher=AUA |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe plain where the university is located was created by the perioding flooding of the Kifisos river. In antiquity the district of Elaionas (olive grove in Greek) where the university is located was considered among the healthiest of Athens. The largest part of the site where the university is located was appropriated by [[Hadji Ali Haseki]], an 18th-century Ottoman ruler of Athens and used as his personal farm. From his time survives one building on the University which is one of the very few of that time that still stands in [[Athens]], though not in its original condition.\n\nAfter the [[1821 revolution]] the plot was confiscated along with the rest of Turkish property of Greece and became the Ruf National Farm. In 1888, after the national benefactor Triantifillides donated money to create three post-secondary schools of Agriculture, one of them was created on the site. By some this is considered as the founding of the university. Others though consider 1920 as the founding date, when the '' Athens College of Agriculture '' was founded by law submitted to parliament by [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. No matter which date is used it is still the third oldest university of Greece, after the [[University of Athens]] and the [[National Technical University of Athens]].\n\n===Early years (1920\u20131937)===\nThe college was the first agricultural research facility in Greece. As its Greek name shows (\u0391\u03bd\u03c9\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd) the college was originally modeled after the French [[Grandes Ecoles]]. First rector was Spyridon Hasiotis who is considered the father of agricultural science in Greece. In the early years the college lacked financial resources and teaching facilities. To help overcome this problem a special fund was set up in 1928. The main income of the university was from the sale of its produce, while the buildings of the Triantafillideios School of Agriculture were inadequate for the needs of a college. At that time the university was under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture which guaranteed employment to all of its graduates, thus making the university very attractive to people of poor background. Students and faculty were involved in politics, something that the [[Metaxas dictatorship]] did not like and thus moved the college to [[Thessaloniki]] in 1937, to become part of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].\n\n===Exile (1937\u20131941)===\nIn Thessaloniki the situation was tougher, since all the work that had been done to improve the site was now useless, due to relocation. After repeated pleads the Occupation Government allowed the return of the college to Athens, but did not abolish the Agriculture Faculty of the Aristotle University which thus exists to this day, as the Faculty of Geotechnical Sciences of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n\n===Return and War (1941\u20131948)===\nUpon return the students and the faculty found the installations in poor condition. Also half the material was left in Thessaloniki to help continue the faculty there. At least though during the occupation, a time when over 300,000 Greeks died of hunger the fields of the university provided food for the students and faculty. The great famine of [[World War II]] gave a sense of urgency to the university's founding mission: to help Greece obtain self-sufficiency in food. To improve the level of education a fifth year was added in 1948 as specialization. 1948 is considered the beginning of the post-war era with the foundation of the central building.\n\n=== After the War (1948\u20131990) ===\nUsing money from the [[Marshall Plan]] the central building was completed in 1952. In 1960 specializations were extended to the fourth year. The [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|1967\u20131974 dictatorship]] brought turmoil to the College, culminating in the suicide of lab technician Theophilos Frangopoulos in 1969, by [[cyanide poisoning]].\n\nGreece's entry to the [[European Economic Community]] allowed European funds to flow thus allowing and expansion both in facilities and departments. Thus in 1984 for the first time Departments were formed. In 1990 the college was renamed as the Agricultural University of Athens.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]], established in 1837, it is the oldest higher education institution in Greece.\n* [[National Technical University of Athens]]\n* [[List of universities in Greece]]\n* [[List of research institutes in Greece]]\n* [[European Higher Education Area]]\n* [[Education in Greece]]\n* [[Open access in Greece]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www2.aua.gr/en Agricultural University of Athens Official Website] {{in lang|el|en}}\n* [https://www.adip.gr/en Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (HQA)] {{in lang|en}}\n* [https://modip.aua.gr/ Agricultural University of Athens Quality Assurance Unit] {{in lang|el}}  \n* [http://dasta.aua.gr/ Agricultural University of Athens DASTA Office (Career Office & Innovation Unit)] {{in lang|el|en}}\n* [http://www.minedu.gov.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9325 \"ATHENA\" Plan for Higher Education] {{in lang|el}}  \n* [https://grnet.gr/en/ Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET)] {{in lang|el|en}}\n* [http://www.heal-link.gr/?lang=en Hellenic Academic Libraries Link (HEAL-Link))] {{in lang|el|en}}\n* [http://www.kallipos.gr/ Kallipos (e-books Greek academic publishing)] {{in lang|el|en}}\n* [https://www.studyingreece.edu.gr/ Study in Greece \u2013 Official portal for studies in Greece] {{in lang|el|en}}\n* [http://proson.eoppep.gr/en Hellenic Qualifications Framework (HQF)] {{in lang|el|en}}\n\n{{Greek Universities}}\n\n{{coord|37|59|2|N|23|42|20|E|region:GR|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Universities in Greece]]\n[[Category:Agricultural universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Education in Athens]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1920]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox University\n|name             = Agricultural University of Athens\n|native_name      = \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd\n|native_name_lang = gr\n|latin_name       = Universitas \u0391griculturae Atheniensis\n|image            = Agricultural University of Athens logo.PNG\n|image_size       = 200px\n|caption          = Logo of the Agricultural University of Athens\n|established      = 1920\n|type             = [[public university|Public]]<br />[[List of universities in Greece|Greece University System]]<br />[[Higher education|Higher Education Institution]]\n|endowment        =\n|staff            =\n|faculty          =\n|president        =\n|provost          =\n|principal        = \n|rector           = \n|chancellor       = Spyridon Kintzios\n|vice_chancellor  = Serko Haroutounian <br/> Iordanis Chatzipavlidis <br/> Stavros Zografakis\n|dean             =\n|head_label       =\n|head             = \n|students         =\n|undergrad        = \n|postgrad         = \n|doctoral         =\n|city             = [[Athens]]\n|state            = [[Attiki]]\n|country          = [[Greece]]\n|campus           = 250,000 m\u00b2\n|free_label       =\n|free             =\n|colors           =\n|colours          = \n|mascot           =\n|nickname         =\n|affiliations     =\n|website          = [http://www.aua.gr/ www.aua.gr]\n|athletics        =\n}}\nThe '''Agricultural University of Athens''' ('''AUA'''; {{lang-el|\u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd}}) is the third oldest university in Greece.

In antiquity the district of Elaionas (olive grove in Greek) where the university is located was considered among the healthiest of Athens. The largest part of the site where the university is located was appropriated by [[Hadji Ali Haseki]], an 18th-century Ottoman ruler of Athens and used as his personal farm. From his time survives one building on the University which is one of the very few of that time that still stands in [[Athens]], though not in its original condition.\n\nAfter the [[1821 revolution]] the plot was confiscated along with the rest of Turkish property of Greece and became the Ruf National Farm. In 1888, after the national benefactor Triantifillides donated money to create three post-secondary schools of Agriculture, one of them was created on the site. By some this is considered as the founding of the university. Others though consider 1920 as the founding date, when the '' Athens College of Agriculture '' was founded by law submitted to parliament by [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. No matter which date is used it is still the third oldest university of Greece, after the [[University of Athens]] and the [[National Technical University of Athens]].\n\n===Early years (1920\u20131937)===\nThe college was the first agricultural research facility in Greece. As its Greek name shows (\u0391\u03bd\u03c9\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd) the college was originally modeled after the French [[Grandes Ecoles]]. First rector was Spyridon Hasiotis who is considered the father of agricultural science in Greece. In the early years the college lacked financial resources and teaching facilities. To help overcome this problem a special fund was set up in 1928. The main income of the university was from the sale of its produce, while the buildings of the Triantafillideios School of Agriculture were inadequate for the needs of a college. At that time the university was under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture which guaranteed employment to all of its graduates, thus making the university very attractive to people of poor background. Students and faculty were involved in politics, something that the [[Metaxas dictatorship]] did not like and thus moved the college to [[Thessaloniki]] in 1937, to become part of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].\n\n===Exile (1937\u20131941)===\nIn Thessaloniki the situation was tougher, since all the work that had been done to improve the site was now useless, due to relocation. After repeated pleads the Occupation Government allowed the return of the college to Athens, but did not abolish the Agriculture Faculty of the Aristotle University which thus exists to this day, as the Faculty of Geotechnical Sciences of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n\n===Return and War (1941\u20131948)===\nUpon return the students and the faculty found the installations in poor condition. Also half the material was left in Thessaloniki to help continue the faculty there. At least though during the occupation, a time when over 300,000 Greeks died of hunger the fields of the university provided food for the students and faculty. The great famine of [[World War II]] gave a sense of urgency to the university's founding mission: to help Greece obtain self-sufficiency in food. To improve the level of education a fifth year was added in 1948 as specialization. 1948 is considered the beginning of the post-war era with the foundation of the central building.\n\n=== After the War (1948\u20131990) ===\nUsing money from the [[Marshall Plan]] the central building was completed in 1952. In 1960 specializations were extended to the fourth year.
