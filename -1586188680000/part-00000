At the beginning of 2017, Ventspils had a population of 39,286. It is situated on the [[Venta River]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], and has an [[ice-free port]]. The city's name literally means \"castle on the Venta\", referring to the [[Ventspils Castle|Livonian Order's castle]] built alongside the Venta River.

It was chartered in 1314 and became an important mercantile city of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n\nAs part of the [[Duchy of Courland]], Ventspils blossomed as a shipbuilding centre. 44 warships and 79 trading ships were built in the town, and it was from Ventspils that the [[Jacob Kettler|Duke's]] fleet set out to [[Couronian colonization|colonize]] [[Gambia]] and [[Tobago]]. Metal, amber, and wood-working shops also became important to the city's development.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0531-500, Kurland, Evakuierung aus Windau.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Latvian civilians fleeing Red Army 1944]]\nDuring the [[Polish-Swedish War]] and the [[Great Northern War]], Ventspils was destroyed, and in 1711 a plague wiped out most of the remaining inhabitants. After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795 Ventspils fell under the control of [[Russian Empire]].\n\nIt was not until about 1850 that shipbuilding and trade became important again. The port was modernized in the 1890s and connected to Moscow by rail. It became one of Imperial Russia's most profitable ports, by 1913 turning a yearly profit of 130 million rubles. The population soared as well, growing from 7,000 in 1897, to 29,000 in 1913.\n\nDuring the German occupation from 1915\u20131919, the population decreased almost by half, though some returned home during the First Republic of Latvia (1918\u20131940).\n\nIn 1939,{{fact|date=December 2019}} the [[Red Army]] established a base in Ventspils. Under Soviet rule, an oil pipeline was built to Ventspils, and became the USSR's leading port in crude oil export. {{convert|30|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} north of Ventspils is the ex-Soviet [[radioastronomy]] installation [[Ventspils Starptautiskais Radioastronomijas Centrs|VIRAC]] (''Ventspils Starptautiskais radioastronomijas centrs'' or ''Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Centre''). The existence of the ''Centrs'' was unknown to most Latvians until 1994. After independence, the Latvian government began a city-beautification process to make the city more attractive to tourists.\n\nIn 2004, Ventspils was a host city for a multi-national (United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden, Russia, Latvia, Denmark, Finland, Norway) naval exercise called [[BALTOPS|Baltic Operations XXXIII (BALTOPS)]].  The force was led by the [[guided missile cruiser]] [[USS Anzio (CG-68)|USS ''Anzio]] and the destroyer {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}}. The US vessels were the first American warships to visit the port of Ventspils since Latvian independence was declared.\n\n== Demography ==\nAt the beginning of 2017, Ventspils had an official population of 39,447 (54.3% of them were women compared with 45.7% men).\n\n63% of Ventspils [[population]] (24,762 people) are 15\u201362 years old, 14.3% (5,647 people) are 0\u201314 years old, and 22.6% (8,877 people) are 62 years and over.\n\nPopulation of Ventspils according to [[ethnic group]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Large amounts of [[Petroleum|oil]] and other mineral resources from [[Russia]] are loaded aboard ships at Ventspils. [[Ventspils Airport]], one of the three international airports in Latvia, is located in the city. [[Ventspils High Technology Park]] provides infrastructure and services to IT and electronics companies.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:680x680-091115-Juras-varti.jpg|thumb|Theatre House \"J\u016bras V\u0101rti\"]]\nEvery winter Ventspils hosts the awarding ceremony of the Latvian Radio broadcast ''Musical Bank'' and the televised national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. On the second weekend of July the ''Sea Festival'' takes place, and on the first weekend of August there is an annual city festival.\n\nThere are several institutions taking responsibility for the cultural life of Ventspils, including:\n* The Theatre House \"Juras varti\" presents professional performing arts of various genres.\n* The Ventspils Museum is engaged in the research and the recording of the history of Ventspils. It writes the Ventspils City Chronicle, builds up the collections of the museum and carries out scientific work.\n* The Ventspils Library is a municipal, cultural, educational, and information institution.\n* The International Writers and Translators' House is an international centre for writers and translators.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Olympic centre.jpg|thumb|Ventspils' Olympic Centre]]\nVentspils has a well developed sports infrastructure. One of the most popular sporting facility in Ventspils is the ''Olympic Centre 'Ventspils''' offering a basketball hall, ice hall, track-and-field arena, and football stadiums. One can also enjoy the ''Water Adventure Park'',''Seaside Aqua-Park'', and ''Adventure Park'' that turns into a ''Skiing Hill 'Lemberga h\u016bte'' during the winter.\n\nThe city has a [[basketball]] team that has won the Latvian championship in the last several years. In the 2001/2002 season, the team took third place in the [[North European Basketball League]] (NEBL). Ventspils also has a [[football (soccer)|football]] team in [[FK Ventspils]] who compete in the [[Virsliga]]. In the 2006 season the team has won the Latvian championship for the first time.\n\n== Tourism ==\nVentspils has a {{RailGauge|600mm|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] train; a beach and dunes and an observatory with a telescope and digital planetarium.\n\n===Old Town of Ventspils===\n[[File:Ventspils Nikolai kirik 2010.jpg|thumb|220px|Ventspils Nicholas Lutheran church]]\nVentspils developed rapidly as a commercial harbour in the years of growth of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. The most active building works took place in the vicinity of the present Market Square where a number of former storehouses from the 17th century are preserved. A dwelling house at the crossing of Tirgus and Skolas Streets is one of the oldest houses of such type in Latvia (built in 1646).\n\nNext to the Market Square, in a historical school building on Skolas street, there is the Ventspils House of the Crafts (2007). The International Writers\u2019 and Translators\u2019 House (2006) was opened on the premises of the former City Hall (1850), on the City-Hall Square. The building is reconstructed to accommodate creative work and everyday needs of its writers. Located next to it are the recently renovated Ventspils Central Library (2006) and Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Nicholas (1835). The City-Hall Square, the Market Square and the Ostas Street Promenade are popular walking places.\n\n===Cow sculptures===\n[[File:Ventspilis. Keliaujanti karve.

At the beginning of 2017, Ventspils had a population of 39,286. It is situated on the [[Venta River]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], and has an [[ice-free port]]. The city's name literally means \"castle on the Venta\", referring to the [[Ventspils Castle|Livonian Order's castle]] built alongside the Venta River.

It was chartered in 1314 and became an important mercantile city of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n\nAs part of the [[Duchy of Courland]], Ventspils blossomed as a shipbuilding centre. 44 warships and 79 trading ships were built in the town, and it was from Ventspils that the [[Jacob Kettler|Duke's]] fleet set out to [[Couronian colonization|colonize]] [[Gambia]] and [[Tobago]]. Metal, amber, and wood-working shops also became important to the city's development.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0531-500, Kurland, Evakuierung aus Windau.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Latvian civilians fleeing Red Army 1944]]\nDuring the [[Polish-Swedish War]] and the [[Great Northern War]], Ventspils was destroyed, and in 1711 a plague wiped out most of the remaining inhabitants. After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795 Ventspils fell under the control of [[Russian Empire]].\n\nIt was not until about 1850 that shipbuilding and trade became important again. The port was modernized in the 1890s and connected to Moscow by rail. It became one of Imperial Russia's most profitable ports, by 1913 turning a yearly profit of 130 million rubles. The population soared as well, growing from 7,000 in 1897, to 29,000 in 1913.\n\nDuring the German occupation from 1915\u20131919, the population decreased almost by half, though some returned home during the First Republic of Latvia (1918\u20131940).\n\nIn 1939,{{fact|date=December 2019}} the [[Red Army]] established a base in Ventspils. Under Soviet rule, an oil pipeline was built to Ventspils, and became the USSR's leading port in crude oil export. {{convert|30|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} north of Ventspils is the ex-Soviet [[radioastronomy]] installation [[Ventspils Starptautiskais Radioastronomijas Centrs|VIRAC]] (''Ventspils Starptautiskais radioastronomijas centrs'' or ''Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Centre''). The existence of the ''Centrs'' was unknown to most Latvians until 1994. After independence, the Latvian government began a city-beautification process to make the city more attractive to tourists.\n\nIn 2004, Ventspils was a host city for a multi-national (United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden, Russia, Latvia, Denmark, Finland, Norway) naval exercise called [[BALTOPS|Baltic Operations XXXIII (BALTOPS)]].  The force was led by the [[guided missile cruiser]] [[USS Anzio (CG-68)|USS ''Anzio]] and the destroyer {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}}. The US vessels were the first American warships to visit the port of Ventspils since Latvian independence was declared.\n\n== Demography ==\nAt the beginning of 2017, Ventspils had an official population of 39,447 (54.3% of them were women compared with 45.7% men).\n\n63% of Ventspils [[population]] (24,762 people) are 15\u201362 years old, 14.3% (5,647 people) are 0\u201314 years old, and 22.6% (8,877 people) are 62 years and over.\n\nPopulation of Ventspils according to [[ethnic group]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Large amounts of [[Petroleum|oil]] and other mineral resources from [[Russia]] are loaded aboard ships at Ventspils. [[Ventspils Airport]], one of the three international airports in Latvia, is located in the city. [[Ventspils High Technology Park]] provides infrastructure and services to IT and electronics companies.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:680x680-091115-Juras-varti.jpg|thumb|Theatre House \"J\u016bras V\u0101rti\"]]\nEvery winter Ventspils hosts the awarding ceremony of the Latvian Radio broadcast ''Musical Bank'' and the televised national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. On the second weekend of July the ''Sea Festival'' takes place, and on the first weekend of August there is an annual city festival.\n\nThere are several institutions taking responsibility for the cultural life of Ventspils, including:\n* The Theatre House \"Juras varti\" presents professional performing arts of various genres.\n* The Ventspils Museum is engaged in the research and the recording of the history of Ventspils. It writes the Ventspils City Chronicle, builds up the collections of the museum and carries out scientific work.\n* The Ventspils Library is a municipal, cultural, educational, and information institution.\n* The International Writers and Translators' House is an international centre for writers and translators.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Olympic centre.jpg|thumb|Ventspils' Olympic Centre]]\nVentspils has a well developed sports infrastructure. One of the most popular sporting facility in Ventspils is the ''Olympic Centre 'Ventspils''' offering a basketball hall, ice hall, track-and-field arena, and football stadiums. One can also enjoy the ''Water Adventure Park'',''Seaside Aqua-Park'', and ''Adventure Park'' that turns into a ''Skiing Hill 'Lemberga h\u016bte'' during the winter.\n\nThe city has a [[basketball]] team that has won the Latvian championship in the last several years. In the 2001/2002 season, the team took third place in the [[North European Basketball League]] (NEBL). Ventspils also has a [[football (soccer)|football]] team in [[FK Ventspils]] who compete in the [[Virsliga]]. In the 2006 season the team has won the Latvian championship for the first time.\n\n== Tourism ==\nVentspils has a {{RailGauge|600mm|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] train; a beach and dunes and an observatory with a telescope and digital planetarium.\n\n===Old Town of Ventspils===\n[[File:Ventspils Nikolai kirik 2010.jpg|thumb|220px|Ventspils Nicholas Lutheran church]]\nVentspils developed rapidly as a commercial harbour in the years of growth of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. The most active building works took place in the vicinity of the present Market Square where a number of former storehouses from the 17th century are preserved. A dwelling house at the crossing of Tirgus and Skolas Streets is one of the oldest houses of such type in Latvia (built in 1646).\n\nNext to the Market Square, in a historical school building on Skolas street, there is the Ventspils House of the Crafts (2007). The International Writers\u2019 and Translators\u2019 House (2006) was opened on the premises of the former City Hall (1850), on the City-Hall Square. The building is reconstructed to accommodate creative work and everyday needs of its writers. Located next to it are the recently renovated Ventspils Central Library (2006) and Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Nicholas (1835). The City-Hall Square, the Market Square and the Ostas Street Promenade are popular walking places.\n\n===Cow sculptures===\n[[File:Ventspilis. Keliaujanti karve.

Brown starred in several of the genre: ''[[Slaughter (1972 film)|Slaughter]]'' (1972), a huge hit for [[Action International Pictures|AIP]]; ''[[Black Gunn]]'' (1972) for Columbia; ''[[Slaughter's Big Rip-Off]]'' (1973); ''[[The Slams]]'' (1973), back at MGM; ''[[I Escaped from Devil's Island]]'' (1973); and ''[[Three the Hard Way (film)|Three the Hard Way]]'' (1974) with [[Fred Williamson]] and [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]].\n\nHe did a [[spaghetti Western]] with Williamson, ''[[Take a Hard Ride]]'' (1975).

Harris himself, who retired after the [[1984 NFL season|1984 season]] after playing eight games with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], fell short of Brown's mark. Following Harris's last season, in that January, a challenge between Brown and Harris in a 40-yard dash was nationally televised. Brown, at 48 years old, was certain he could beat Harris, though Harris was only 34 years old and just ending his elite career.

It is situated in the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. The municipality of Venlo counted 101,578 inhabitants as of January 2019.<ref name=\"CBS20190306\">Statistics Netherlands (CBS), {{cite web\n |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table?ts=1551869147443\n |title=Bevolkingsontwikkeling; regio per maand\n}} Retrieved on 6 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:RivierenkaartVenlo.jpg|thumb|left|Map circa 1850]]\nRoman and Celtic coins have been found in Venlo; it was speculated to have been the settlement known as ''[[Sablones]]'' on the Roman road connecting [[Maastricht]] with [[Xanten]], but the little evidence there is concerning the location of Sablones speaks against this thought while there is no evidence in support of it. Blerick, on the west bank, was known as ''Blariacum''.\n\nDocuments from the 9th century mention Venlo as a trade post;\nit developed into one of the more important ones in the Meuse-Rhine area,\nreceiving [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1343,\nand becoming a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1375.\n \nBecause of its strategic importance, the city of Venlo was besieged several times. The most significant siege was that of 1702, carried on by [[Menno van Coehoorn]]. Consequently, Venlo was incorporated into the [[Generaliteitslanden]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] at the [[Peace of Utrecht|Treaty of 1713]]. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] it became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 9 November 1939, two British Intelligence Service agents were kidnapped by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' in what became known as the [[Venlo Incident]]. The incident was used by the Nazis to link [[UK|Great Britain]] to [[Georg Elser]]'s failed assassination of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] at the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]] the day before and to justify their later [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]], a neutral country, on 10 May 1940.\n\nVenlo had both a road and a railway bridge over the Maas ([[River Meuse]]). The city was severely damaged by bombing raids (13 October \u2013 19 November 1944) on the bridges at the end of the war.\n[[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] made 13 attempts to destroy the bridges to cut the German supply lines and block a retreat of the German army across the river. These failed, and it was the retreating German troops who in the end blew up the bridges in an attempt to stop the allied advance. Allied forces liberated Venlo from the east, from inside Germany itself.\n\nAbout 300 people were killed due to those raids. The raids also cost Venlo a major part of its historical buildings. However, some old buildings, such as the city hall (the 'Stadhuis') and the 'R\u00f6mer' house, survived the war relatively unscathed.\n\nBefore the war, Venlo had an active Jewish community. Most of the Jews were murdered in [[The Holocaust]].\n\n=== Post-Second World War era ===\n[[File:Venlo-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of the city of Venlo, as of March 2014]]\nBy the late 1990s, drug-related nuisance had become a problem in the centre of Venlo.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Snippe | first1 = J. | last2 = Naayer | first2 = H. | last3 = Bieleman | first3 = B. | title = Hektor in 2005.

Tegelen was originally part of the [[Duchy of J\u00fclich]] centuries ago, whereas Venlo has a past in the [[Duchy of Guelders]]. On 1 January 2010, the municipality of [[Arcen en Velden]], was merged into the municipality of Venlo.\n\nIn 2003 Venlo was awarded the title \"Greenest city of Europe\". Venlo was the host of [[Floriade 2012]], the world's largest horticultural exhibition.\n\nIn 2013, Venlo won the prestigious 'Best City Centre of the Netherlands' award. It amazed the jury by all the investments which have been made in the last couple of years in the Maas Boulevard, the railway station, the tunnel in the centre and the Maas bridge.<ref name=\"Best city centre\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.fontysvenlo.nl/pages/posts/venlo-has-best-city-center-in-the-netherlands-285.php\n |title        = Venlo has Best City Centre in the Netherlands\n |trans-title  = Venlo has Best City Centre in the Netherlands\n |date         = 2013\n |publisher    = Fontys Venlo\n |accessdate   = 20 December 2014\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140324232628/http://www.fontysvenlo.nl/pages/posts/venlo-has-best-city-center-in-the-netherlands-285.php\n |archive-date = 24 March 2014\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Venlo 009.jpg|thumb|City hall of Venlo]]\n[[File:Venlo, ingang van het Limburgs Museum IMG 0124 2018-02-18 10.46.jpg|Limburgs Museum|thumb|left]]\n*Theatre \"De Maaspoort\"\n*[[Limburg Museum]] and Art Museum \"[[Museum van Bommel van Dam]]\"\n*[[Venlo Police Museum]]\n*Pop venue Grenswerk (formerly Perron 55)\n*Major annual cultural events\n**Carnival called \"Vastelaovend\" in February/March (6 weeks before Easter). \n**Summer park festivities called \"Zomerparkfeest\" in August held in and around the main park of Venlo, a 4 days podium for a broad audience, including live music, film, dance, art etc.\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Fontys_International_Campus_Venlo.jpg|thumb|right|Fontys International Campus Venlo]]\n\nVenlo, being a city with a 100,000+ population, is served by a large number of schools both at primary and secondary education levels. In addition, Venlo is a higher-education hub within the southern Netherlands, with several institutes of higher education.\n\nVenlo hosts three different institutes of higher education:\n\n*[[Fontys University of Applied Sciences]] (International Campus Venlo)\n*[[HAS University of Applied Sciences]] (Venlo branch)\n*[[Maastricht University]] (University College Venlo)\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVenlo is connected to Germany by two motorways ([[Bundesautobahn 40]] and [[Bundesautobahn 61]]), which connect to [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Duisburg]], [[Cologne]] and the [[Ruhr area]] within one hour.\n\n[[Venlo railway station]] is a [[junction station]]. It provides regular connections to the Dutch cities of [[Eindhoven]], [[Roermond]] and [[Nijmegen]].

and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the southeastern [[Netherlands]], within a couple of miles of the German border. It is situated in the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. The municipality of Venlo counted 101,578 inhabitants as of January 2019.<ref name=\"CBS20190306\">Statistics Netherlands (CBS), {{cite web\n |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table?ts=1551869147443\n |title=Bevolkingsontwikkeling; regio per maand\n}} Retrieved on 6 March 2019.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:RivierenkaartVenlo.jpg|thumb|left|Map circa 1850]]\nRoman and Celtic coins have been found in Venlo; it was speculated to have been the settlement known as ''[[Sablones]]'' on the Roman road connecting [[Maastricht]] with [[Xanten]], but the little evidence there is concerning the location of Sablones speaks against this thought while there is no evidence in support of it. Blerick, on the west bank, was known as ''Blariacum''.\n\nDocuments from the 9th century mention Venlo as a trade post;\nit developed into one of the more important ones in the Meuse-Rhine area,\nreceiving [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1343,\nand becoming a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1375.\n \nBecause of its strategic importance, the city of Venlo was besieged several times. The most significant siege was that of 1702, carried on by [[Menno van Coehoorn]]. Consequently, Venlo was incorporated into the [[Generaliteitslanden]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] at the [[Peace of Utrecht|Treaty of 1713]]. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] it became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 9 November 1939, two British Intelligence Service agents were kidnapped by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' in what became known as the [[Venlo Incident]]. The incident was used by the Nazis to link [[UK|Great Britain]] to [[Georg Elser]]'s failed assassination of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] at the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]] the day before and to justify their later [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]], a neutral country, on 10 May 1940.\n\nVenlo had both a road and a railway bridge over the Maas ([[River Meuse]]). The city was severely damaged by bombing raids (13 October \u2013 19 November 1944) on the bridges at the end of the war.\n[[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] made 13 attempts to destroy the bridges to cut the German supply lines and block a retreat of the German army across the river. These failed, and it was the retreating German troops who in the end blew up the bridges in an attempt to stop the allied advance. Allied forces liberated Venlo from the east, from inside Germany itself.\n\nAbout 300 people were killed due to those raids. The raids also cost Venlo a major part of its historical buildings. However, some old buildings, such as the city hall (the 'Stadhuis') and the 'R\u00f6mer' house, survived the war relatively unscathed.\n\nBefore the war, Venlo had an active Jewish community. Most of the Jews were murdered in [[The Holocaust]].\n\n=== Post-Second World War era ===\n[[File:Venlo-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of the city of Venlo, as of March 2014]]\nBy the late 1990s, drug-related nuisance had become a problem in the centre of Venlo.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Snippe | first1 = J. | last2 = Naayer | first2 = H. | last3 = Bieleman | first3 = B. | title = Hektor in 2005.

Tegelen was originally part of the [[Duchy of J\u00fclich]] centuries ago, whereas Venlo has a past in the [[Duchy of Guelders]].

[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh Rameses' recently widowed daughter (and sister of the future Pharaoh Sethi), finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sethi]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi had planned on naming Moses as his heir, but now announces that Rameses will be his successor and will also marry Nefretari. However, Sethi still loves Moses like a son so he can\u2019t bring himself to pass final judgement on him and instead tells Rameses to do what he thinks is best. Rameses knows how much Nefreteri loves Moses and decides that killing him would just make him a martyr to her so instead he banishes Moses to the desert. As he\u2019s sending Moses out of Egypt, Rameses says that the desert will be Moses\u2019 kingdom and that kings need a robe so he hands him Yochabel\u2019s Levite robe and tells him that she had died.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\nMoses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]] and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nForty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n\n==Cast==\nIn the film's [[title sequence]], the cast is credited in the following order:\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Sinai stone with Cecil B. DeMille. Inscription is identical to the props in the film.]]\nCommentary for the film's DVD edition chronicles the historical research done by DeMille and associates. Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the [[Quran]], which was sometimes used as a source.  She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments'' \u2013 including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt|publisher=}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig light]]s heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">[[Katherine Orrison]]'s audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

In fact, many of the supposed inaccuracies were actually adopted by DeMille from extra-biblical ancient sources, such as [[Josephus]], the Sepher ha-Yashar, and the [[Chronicle of Moses]]. Moses's career in Ethiopia, for instance, is based on ancient [[midrash]]im.<ref>L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, Philadelphia 1967; A.

Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]]/[[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]]/[[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii]]. The exception is 2020 which the filmed aired the week before Easter. The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and forty-four minutes, just above one hour longer its three-hour and thirty-nine-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11&nbsp;p.m./10&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8&nbsp;p.m./7&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original 1.66:1 VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMany of ABC\u2019s telecasts omit Cecil B.

[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh Rameses' recently widowed daughter (and sister of the future Pharaoh Sethi), finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sethi]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi had planned on naming Moses as his heir, but now announces that Rameses will be his successor and will also marry Nefretari. However, Sethi still loves Moses like a son so he can\u2019t bring himself to pass final judgement on him and instead tells Rameses to do what he thinks is best. Rameses knows how much Nefreteri loves Moses and decides that killing him would just make him a martyr to her so instead he banishes Moses to the desert. As he\u2019s sending Moses out of Egypt, Rameses says that the desert will be Moses\u2019 kingdom and that kings need a robe so he hands him Yochabel\u2019s Levite robe and tells him that she had died.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\nMoses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]] and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nForty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n\n==Cast==\nIn the film's [[title sequence]], the cast is credited in the following order:\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Sinai stone with Cecil B. DeMille. Inscription is identical to the props in the film.]]\nCommentary for the film's DVD edition chronicles the historical research done by DeMille and associates. Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the [[Quran]], which was sometimes used as a source.  She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments'' \u2013 including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt|publisher=}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig light]]s heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">[[Katherine Orrison]]'s audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

Initially, DeMille hired Bernstein, then a relatively unknown film composer, to write and record only the [[diegetic music]] required for the film's dance sequences and other onscreen musical passages, with the intention of employing frequent collaborator [[Victor Young]] to write the score proper. However, Young turned down the assignment due to his own failing health, causing DeMille to hire Bernstein to write the underscore as well.<ref name=\"DeWald\">{{cite news|last1=DeWald|first1=Frank K.|title=So Let It Be Written.

The score is written in a highly [[Romantic music|Romantic]] style, featuring unique musical [[leitmotif]]s for the film's characters (God, Moses, Rameses, Nefretiri, etc.) used in a manner inspired, at DeMille's direction, by the opera scores of [[Richard Wagner]].<ref name=\"DeWald\"/> Bernstein recorded both the diegetic music and the  score at the Paramount Studios Recording Stage in sessions spread from April 1955 to August 1956.<ref>{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Technical Notes|work=The Ten Commandments: 60th Anniversary Soundtrack Collection|publisher=Intrada Records|date=2016}}</ref>\n\nA double-LP [[monaural]] soundtrack album was released in 1957 by [[Dot Records]], utilizing excerpts from the original film recordings.

Moses's career in Ethiopia, for instance, is based on ancient [[midrash]]im.<ref>L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, Philadelphia 1967; A. Shinan, \"Moses and the Ethiopian Woman: Sources of a Story in The Chronicle of Moses\", Scripta Hierosolymitana 27 (1978).</ref> For decades, a showing of ''The Ten Commandments'' was a popular fundraiser among revivalist [[Christian Church]]es, while the film was equally treasured by film buffs for DeMille's \"cast of thousands\" approach and the heroic acting.\n\n==Home media==\n''The Ten Commandments'' has been released on [[DVD]] in the United States on four occasions: the first edition (Widescreen Collection) was released on March 30, 1999 as a two-disc set,<ref name=\"The Ten Commandments (1956) - DVD Movie Guide\">{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|title=The Ten Commandments (1956) |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/tencommandments.shtml|work=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> the second edition (Special Collector's Edition) was released on March 9, 2004, as a two-disc set with commentary by [[Katherine Orrison]],<ref name=\"The Ten Commandments (Special Collector's Edition)\">{{cite web|title=The Ten Commandments (Special Collector's Edition)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/9834/ten-commandments-special-collectors-edition-the/|work=DVD Talk|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> the third edition (50th Anniversary Collection) was released on March 21, 2006 as a three-disc set with the 1923 version and special features,<ref name=\"The Ten Commandments - 50th Anniversary Collection\">{{cite web|title=The Ten Commandments \u2013 50th Anniversary Collection|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20904/ten-commandments-50th-anniversary-collection-the/|work=DVD Talk|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> and the fourth edition (55th Anniversary Edition) was released on DVD again in a two-disc set on March 29, 2011, and for the first time on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in a two-disc set and a six-disc limited edition gift set with the 1923 version and DVD copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/the-ten-commandments5.html|title=Paramount has revealed official details on the 1956 Charlton Hestone movie|publisher=DVD Active|author=Tom Woodward|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=January 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021220500/http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/the-ten-commandments5.html|archive-date=October 21, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012, the limited edition gift set won the Home Media Award for Best Packaging (Paramount Pictures and Johns Byrne).<ref name=\"Home Media Award Winners by Category\">{{cite web|title=Home Media Award Winners by Category|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/awards/home-media-award-winners-category|work=[[Home Media Magazine]]|accessdate=April 1, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214230502/http://www.homemediamagazine.com/awards/home-media-award-winners-category|archivedate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Television broadcast==\n''The Ten Commandments'' was first broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network on February 18, 1973,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/02/18/97115660.pdf | title=Television This Week; TODAY--SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 18}}</ref> and has aired annually on the network since then, with the exception of 1999,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1999/04/05/the-ten-commandments-abcs-exodus/43dfa945-0d86-4ba5-87c0-0f298c71e17e/|title=The 'Ten Commandments': ABC's Exodus?|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 5, 1999}}</ref> traditionally during the [[Passover]] and [[Easter Sunday|Easter]] holidays. Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]]/[[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]]/[[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii]]. The exception is 2020 which the filmed aired the week before Easter. The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and forty-four minutes, just above one hour longer its three-hour and thirty-nine-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11&nbsp;p.m./10&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8&nbsp;p.m./7&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original 1.66:1 VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMany of ABC\u2019s telecasts omit Cecil B.

Located in the Northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], it straddles on the southern shore of an inlet of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Ria de Vigo]], the southernmost of the so-called [[R\u00edas Baixas]]. Vigo is the most populated municipality of the [[province of Pontevedra]] and the whole region as well as also the biggest one in the country without the status of provincial capital.\n\nIt has an area of {{cvt|109.06|km\u00b2}} and had a population of 292,817 in 2016. According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]] the city proper has 198,537 inhabitants, while the rest of the municipal population dwell in a number of rural and suburban parishes.\n\nVigo is, along [[A Coru\u00f1a]], one of [[Economy of Galicia|the region's primary economic agents]], owing in part to the Citro\u00ebn automotive factory and to the [[Port of Vigo]], reportedly the biggest fishing port in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corelngashive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CORE-LNGas-HIVE-Study-of-Demand-Consolidation-Top-Down-Bottom-Up.pdf|title=Consolidation Top down and Bottom up Analysis|page=9}}</ref> Close to the [[Portugal\u2013Spain border]], Vigo is part of the [[Galicia\u2013North Portugal Euroregion]]. The [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] is headquartered in Vigo.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the small village of Vigo was part of the territory of Galician-speaking neighbouring towns, particularly [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], and suffered several [[Vikings|Viking]] attacks. However, its number of inhabitants was so small that, historically, it was not considered a real villa until around the 15th century, when the earliest records began.\n[[File:Battle of Vigo bay october 23 1702.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Vigo Bay]], 1702]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was attacked several times. In 1585 and 1589, during an unsuccessful attack by the English counter-Armada, [[Francis Drake]] raided the city and temporarily occupied it, burning many buildings. Several decades later a [[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet tried to attack the city. As a result, the city's walls were built in 1656 in the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. They are still partially preserved.\n\n[[File:Plano de Vigo, Francisco Coello e Pascual Madoz, 1856.jpg|thumb|right|19th century map of the city, by {{ill|Francisco Coello de Portugal y Quesada|es}}.]]\nAt this time, and in spite of the attacks, Vigo developed its earliest commerce and was given several privileges by the kings of Spain.\n\nIn 1702, the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]] occurred, and in 1719, because a Spanish fleet which departed from Vigo attempted to invade Scotland in support of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], the city was [[Capture of Vigo|occupied for ten days by a British force]].\n\nIn 1808, the [[French Army]] annexed Spain to the [[Napoleonic Empire]], although Vigo remained unconquered until January, 1809. Vigo was also the first city of Galicia to be freed from French rule, in what is annually celebrated on March 28 as the ''Reconquista'' (reconquest from the French in the context of the [[Peninsular War]]). In 1833, the city of [[Pontevedra]] was designated the provincial capital of the [[province of Pontevedra]], within which is Vigo.\n\nVigo grew very rapidly in the 20th century thanks to the fact that the Franco government granted it a tax-free zone in 1947 so that companies could set up there for free and an Industrial Development Pole in 1964, a very unusual case for a non-capital of a Spanish province. Continuous urban-planning changes left Vigo less structured than other Galician cities such as [[Pontevedra]] and [[A Coru\u00f1a]].\n{{Wide image|Vigo_y_su_r\u00eda_(5546327816b).jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Vigo, as seen from the opposite shore of the [[ria]].}}\n\n==Toponym==\n[[File:Bandera de la ciudad de Vigo (39023915704).jpg|thumb|right|The municipal flag waving in the wind, featuring the olive tree.]]\nVigo's urban area is built over both a hill-fort (''[[Castros in Spain|Castro]]'') and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement. It is generally accepted that the name Vigo is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:vicus#Latin|vicus]] spacorum'', meaning \"small village\".\n\nThe standard pronunciation of Vigo in both [[Galician language|Galician]] and Spanish is {{IPA-es|\u02c8bi\u0263o|}}.\n\nVigo has been given the nickname ''cidade ol\u00edvica'' (city of olives). It is said that, after the conflict between the [[Isabel de Castilla]] and [[Juana la Beltraneja]]\u2014where Galician nobility fought for the latter\u2014the victor ordered all of Galicia's [[olive tree]]s to be cut down, as they symbolized peace. She couldn't uproot the tree in Vigo, however, because it was planted in [[Sacred#Sacred ground|sacred ground]]. The tree is represented in the city seal, and a descendant of it is still alive in Vigo's city centre.\n\n==Geography==\n=== Location ===\nIn the northeast, it borders the municipality of [[Redondela]]; in the east, [[Mos (Spain)|Mos]]; in the south, [[O Porri\u00f1o]] and [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]]; and in the southwest, [[Nigr\u00e1n]]. On the other side of its bay are the municipalities of [[Cangas do Morrazo|Cangas]] and [[Moa\u00f1a]]. \n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Las Islas C\u00edes.jpg|thumb|right|The [[C\u00edes Islands]], part of the municipality of Vigo, partially obstruct the access from the [[Ria de Vigo]] to the open seas.]]\nVigo's climate is usually classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). Although Vigo is the rainiest city in Galicia, in actuality, with its noticeable drying trend in the summer, Vigo's climate is more similar to the variant of the oceanic climate commonly seen in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America. Substantial rainfall throughout the year prevents it from being classified as a Mediterranean climate, even though there is a drying trend in summer.\nThe average annual temperature in Vigo is {{convert|14|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Compared to many other Galician towns, Vigo experiences warmer summer temperatures than A Coru\u00f1a and milder winters than inland areas.  This is due to its sheltered location, surrounded by mountains inland and the [[Islas C\u00edes|Illas C\u00edes]] out in the bay towards the sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galiciaguide.com/Vigo-index.html |title=Vigo |publisher=galiciaguide.com |accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> The all-time record high for the city is {{convert|39.7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} set on July 5, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/observacion/ultimosdatos?k=gal&l=1495&w=1&datos=img |title=Vigo |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Vigo is known for its extreme rainfall in winter.

Institutions such as the ''Real Club Nautico de Vigo'' (RCNV), founded in 1906, and the Liceo Mar\u00edtimo de Bouzas (LMB), founded in 1907, are good examples of promotion of the nautical sports, especially sailing.\n[[File:Regata en la Ria de Vigo (1827331441).jpg|thumb|right|Regatta in the [[Ria de Vigo]].]]\n\nThe RCNV organises important events like Atlantic Week, which in September 2006 included the World Championship of the Platu 25 class. Every August, the RCNV also organises one of the largest sailboat races in the Iberian peninsula: the ''Regata R\u00edas Baixas''. In 2006 more than 130 different boats participated.\n\nThe LMB is a yacht club which counts around 400 associates. The LMB has a long and intense history of sailing and recreational fishing. The LMB organizes two important regattas in the Galician sailing calendar: the ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' and a ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos''.\n\nThe ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' honours the neighbourhood where the LMB is located. The ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos'' is sponsored by the firm Aister and is for crews of one and two members. It is a difficult race with two stages; the first consists of a race through the coastal bay of Vigo while the second stage is a longer race around the [[Cies Islands]] (and/or Ons Islands). The LMB has schools of sailing and fishing. Yearly it organizes a cephalopods fishing competition.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Azc\u00e1rate]], art historian, author, researcher, curator, and professor, specializing in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Castilian art and [[Renaissance]] sculpture.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/azcarate-y-ristori-jose-maria/6cfe9a91-151a-433a-920c-8e9e6c6b549d|title=Azc\u00e1rate y Ristori, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda|website=Museo Nacional del Prado|language=es|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Born in Vigo.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[Antonio M.

Located in the Northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], it straddles on the southern shore of an inlet of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Ria de Vigo]], the southernmost of the so-called [[R\u00edas Baixas]]. Vigo is the most populated municipality of the [[province of Pontevedra]] and the whole region as well as also the biggest one in the country without the status of provincial capital.\n\nIt has an area of {{cvt|109.06|km\u00b2}} and had a population of 292,817 in 2016. According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]] the city proper has 198,537 inhabitants, while the rest of the municipal population dwell in a number of rural and suburban parishes.\n\nVigo is, along [[A Coru\u00f1a]], one of [[Economy of Galicia|the region's primary economic agents]], owing in part to the Citro\u00ebn automotive factory and to the [[Port of Vigo]], reportedly the biggest fishing port in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corelngashive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CORE-LNGas-HIVE-Study-of-Demand-Consolidation-Top-Down-Bottom-Up.pdf|title=Consolidation Top down and Bottom up Analysis|page=9}}</ref> Close to the [[Portugal\u2013Spain border]], Vigo is part of the [[Galicia\u2013North Portugal Euroregion]]. The [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] is headquartered in Vigo.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the small village of Vigo was part of the territory of Galician-speaking neighbouring towns, particularly [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], and suffered several [[Vikings|Viking]] attacks. However, its number of inhabitants was so small that, historically, it was not considered a real villa until around the 15th century, when the earliest records began.\n[[File:Battle of Vigo bay october 23 1702.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Vigo Bay]], 1702]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was attacked several times. In 1585 and 1589, during an unsuccessful attack by the English counter-Armada, [[Francis Drake]] raided the city and temporarily occupied it, burning many buildings. Several decades later a [[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet tried to attack the city. As a result, the city's walls were built in 1656 in the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. They are still partially preserved.\n\n[[File:Plano de Vigo, Francisco Coello e Pascual Madoz, 1856.jpg|thumb|right|19th century map of the city, by {{ill|Francisco Coello de Portugal y Quesada|es}}.]]\nAt this time, and in spite of the attacks, Vigo developed its earliest commerce and was given several privileges by the kings of Spain.\n\nIn 1702, the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]] occurred, and in 1719, because a Spanish fleet which departed from Vigo attempted to invade Scotland in support of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], the city was [[Capture of Vigo|occupied for ten days by a British force]].\n\nIn 1808, the [[French Army]] annexed Spain to the [[Napoleonic Empire]], although Vigo remained unconquered until January, 1809. Vigo was also the first city of Galicia to be freed from French rule, in what is annually celebrated on March 28 as the ''Reconquista'' (reconquest from the French in the context of the [[Peninsular War]]). In 1833, the city of [[Pontevedra]] was designated the provincial capital of the [[province of Pontevedra]], within which is Vigo.\n\nVigo grew very rapidly in the 20th century thanks to the fact that the Franco government granted it a tax-free zone in 1947 so that companies could set up there for free and an Industrial Development Pole in 1964, a very unusual case for a non-capital of a Spanish province. Continuous urban-planning changes left Vigo less structured than other Galician cities such as [[Pontevedra]] and [[A Coru\u00f1a]].\n{{Wide image|Vigo_y_su_r\u00eda_(5546327816b).jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Vigo, as seen from the opposite shore of the [[ria]].}}\n\n==Toponym==\n[[File:Bandera de la ciudad de Vigo (39023915704).jpg|thumb|right|The municipal flag waving in the wind, featuring the olive tree.]]\nVigo's urban area is built over both a hill-fort (''[[Castros in Spain|Castro]]'') and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement. It is generally accepted that the name Vigo is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:vicus#Latin|vicus]] spacorum'', meaning \"small village\".\n\nThe standard pronunciation of Vigo in both [[Galician language|Galician]] and Spanish is {{IPA-es|\u02c8bi\u0263o|}}.\n\nVigo has been given the nickname ''cidade ol\u00edvica'' (city of olives). It is said that, after the conflict between the [[Isabel de Castilla]] and [[Juana la Beltraneja]]\u2014where Galician nobility fought for the latter\u2014the victor ordered all of Galicia's [[olive tree]]s to be cut down, as they symbolized peace. She couldn't uproot the tree in Vigo, however, because it was planted in [[Sacred#Sacred ground|sacred ground]]. The tree is represented in the city seal, and a descendant of it is still alive in Vigo's city centre.\n\n==Geography==\n=== Location ===\nIn the northeast, it borders the municipality of [[Redondela]]; in the east, [[Mos (Spain)|Mos]]; in the south, [[O Porri\u00f1o]] and [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]]; and in the southwest, [[Nigr\u00e1n]]. On the other side of its bay are the municipalities of [[Cangas do Morrazo|Cangas]] and [[Moa\u00f1a]]. \n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Las Islas C\u00edes.jpg|thumb|right|The [[C\u00edes Islands]], part of the municipality of Vigo, partially obstruct the access from the [[Ria de Vigo]] to the open seas.]]\nVigo's climate is usually classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). Although Vigo is the rainiest city in Galicia, in actuality, with its noticeable drying trend in the summer, Vigo's climate is more similar to the variant of the oceanic climate commonly seen in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America. Substantial rainfall throughout the year prevents it from being classified as a Mediterranean climate, even though there is a drying trend in summer.\nThe average annual temperature in Vigo is {{convert|14|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Compared to many other Galician towns, Vigo experiences warmer summer temperatures than A Coru\u00f1a and milder winters than inland areas.  This is due to its sheltered location, surrounded by mountains inland and the [[Islas C\u00edes|Illas C\u00edes]] out in the bay towards the sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galiciaguide.com/Vigo-index.html |title=Vigo |publisher=galiciaguide.com |accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> The all-time record high for the city is {{convert|39.7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} set on July 5, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/observacion/ultimosdatos?k=gal&l=1495&w=1&datos=img |title=Vigo |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Vigo is known for its extreme rainfall in winter.

Although within the city one will not find much Romanesque architecture, it can be seen a few kilometers away from the city center. In many of the municipality's neighborhoods and parishes a large number of Roman ruins remain. Such is the importance of the Roman remains in Vigo that many Spanish authors have come to coin the term ''Romanesque Vigo'' (''rom\u00e1nico vigu\u00e9s'' in Spanish).

It is often considered with [[A Coru\u00f1a]] one of the economic and industrial engines of Galicia.\n\nVigo is one of the leading industrial areas in Galicia, with a French car factory, shipyards, and auxiliary industry in both automotive and marine sectors. Situated in Vigo, the French factory [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]] since 1958, in 2007 produced a total of 545,000 vehicles, of which more than 82% were sold outside Spain.\n\nIn addition, Vigo has a [[fishing]] port  and is the home port of one of the world's largest fishing company, [[Pescanova]] and the most important centre of the Galician canned fish industry. The headquarters of the [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] are also located in the city.\n\nThe publishing industry in Galician is prominent in the city, with Editorial Galaxia and Editorial Xerais.\n\n=== Port of Vigo ===\n\nThe [[Port of Vigo]] covers a length of more than 20&nbsp;km and offers more than 9&nbsp;km of docks.

The most important artists of this postmodern movement were musicians; particularly punk and new wave bands such as ''[[Siniestro Total]]'', ''[[Golpes Bajos]]'', ''[[Aerol\u00edneas Federales]]'', ''Semen Up'' or ''[[Os Resentidos]]''.\n\nAt the moment, the city still has notorious bands like [[Iv\u00e1n Ferreiro]] (ex-singer of Los Piratas) and Mon.\n\n===Media and entertainment===\n[[File:Faro de Vigo, 1853, 3 de noviembre.jpg|thumb|Frontpage of a 1853 issue of the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]''.]]\nVigo has two daily newspapers; the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]'', the oldest newspaper in Spain still in circulation, and the ''[[Atl\u00e1ntico Diario]]'', a little local newspaper.

Vigo also participated in the Europeanwide free newspapers rush led by \"[[Metro International|Metro]]\" and some free journals were published in 1990s and 2000s: \"[[20 minutos]]\", \"Gaceta Universitaria\", \"Redacci\u00f3n Xove\", etcetera. \"Espa\u00f1a Exterior\" is also printed in Vigo.\n\nThe locally produced award-winning feature movie ''[[Mondays In The Sun]]'' (original title ''Los lunes al sol'') depicts the life of several men who have lost their work at the [[Port of Vigo]]. This film is not based on a single individual's experiences but on the perceived collective experiences of many local port workers.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Daniel Wass - RC Celta de Vigo - WMES 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Celta de Vigo]] players during a fixture versus Espanyol]]\nVigo has one of the most important women's basketball team in Spain, [[Celta Indepo|Celta]], more commonly referred to today by its sponsorship name of Celta Indepo.

Institutions such as the ''Real Club Nautico de Vigo'' (RCNV), founded in 1906, and the Liceo Mar\u00edtimo de Bouzas (LMB), founded in 1907, are good examples of promotion of the nautical sports, especially sailing.\n[[File:Regata en la Ria de Vigo (1827331441).jpg|thumb|right|Regatta in the [[Ria de Vigo]].]]\n\nThe RCNV organises important events like Atlantic Week, which in September 2006 included the World Championship of the Platu 25 class. Every August, the RCNV also organises one of the largest sailboat races in the Iberian peninsula: the ''Regata R\u00edas Baixas''. In 2006 more than 130 different boats participated.\n\nThe LMB is a yacht club which counts around 400 associates. The LMB has a long and intense history of sailing and recreational fishing. The LMB organizes two important regattas in the Galician sailing calendar: the ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' and a ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos''.\n\nThe ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' honours the neighbourhood where the LMB is located. The ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos'' is sponsored by the firm Aister and is for crews of one and two members. It is a difficult race with two stages; the first consists of a race through the coastal bay of Vigo while the second stage is a longer race around the [[Cies Islands]] (and/or Ons Islands). The LMB has schools of sailing and fishing. Yearly it organizes a cephalopods fishing competition.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Azc\u00e1rate]], art historian, author, researcher, curator, and professor, specializing in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Castilian art and [[Renaissance]] sculpture.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/azcarate-y-ristori-jose-maria/6cfe9a91-151a-433a-920c-8e9e6c6b549d|title=Azc\u00e1rate y Ristori, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda|website=Museo Nacional del Prado|language=es|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Born in Vigo.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[Antonio M.

Many pelagic fish swim in [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] weighing hundreds of tonnes. Others are solitary, such as the large [[ocean sunfish]] weighing more than 500 kilograms, which sometimes drift passively with ocean currents, eating [[jellyfish]].<ref name=\"Lal8\"/>\n\n==Epipelagic fish==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = Bluefin-big.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Large epipelagic [[predator fish]], such as this [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]], have a deeply forked tail and a smooth body shaped like a spindle tapered at both ends and [[countershading|countershaded]] with silvery colours.\n | image2    = Herring2.jpg\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Small epipelagic [[forage fish]], such as this [[Atlantic herring]], share the same body features listed for the predator fish above\n}}\n\nEpipelagic fish inhabit the epipelagic zone. The [[epipelagic zone]] is the water from the surface of the sea down to 200 metres. It is also referred to as the '''surface waters''' or the '''sunlit zone''', and includes the [[photic zone]]. The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1% of the surface value. This depth depends on how [[turbid]] the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with the epipelagic zone. The [[photic zone]] has sufficient light for [[phytoplankton]] to [[photosynthese]].<ref name=\"Moyle571\"/>\n\nThe epipelagic zone is vast, and is the home for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and can be a good habitat for [[algae]] to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat diversity results in a lack of [[species diversity]], so the zone supports less than 2% of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the [[continental shelves]], where [[land runoff]] can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where [[upwelling]] moves nutrients into the area.<ref name=\"Moyle571\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 571</ref>\n\nEpipelagic fish can be divided broadly into small [[forage fish]] and larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. Forage fish [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] and [[Filter feeder|filter feed]] on [[plankton]]. Most epipelagic fish have streamlined bodies capable of sustained cruising on [[Fish migration|migrations]]. In general, predatory and forage fish share the same [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features. Predator fish are usually [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] with large mouths, smooth bodies, and deeply forked tails. Many use vision to prey on zooplankton or smaller fish, while others [[Filter feeder|filter feed]] on [[plankton]].\n\n[[File:Herring Silvering.svg|thumb|160px|left|[[Herring]] reflectors are nearly vertical for camouflage from the side]]\n\nMost epipelagic predator fish and their smaller prey fish are [[countershading|countershaded]] with silvery colours that reduce visibility by scattering incoming light.<ref name=\"Moyle571\"/> The silvering is achieved with reflective [[fish scale]]s that function as small mirrors. This may give an effect of transparency. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror that is oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side.<ref name=Herring2002>Herring, Peter (2002) ''The Biology of the Deep Ocean'', pp. 192\u2013195, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-854956-7}}.</ref>\n\nIn the shallower epipelagic waters, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly, has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.<ref name=Herring2002/>\n\nAlthough the number of species is limited, epipelagic fishes are abundant. What they lack in diversity they make up for in numbers. Forage fish occur in huge numbers, and large fish that prey on them often are sought after as premier [[Fish (food)|food fish]]. As a group, epipelagic fishes form the most valuable [[fisheries]] in the world.<ref name=\"Moyle571\"/>\n\nMany forage fish are facultative predators that can pick individual [[copepod]]s or fish larvae out of the water column, and then change to filter feeding on [[phytoplankton]] when energetically, that gives better results. Filter feeding fish usually use long fine [[gill raker]]s to strain small organisms from the water column. Some of the largest epipelagic fishes, such as the [[basking shark]] and [[whale shark]], are filter feeders, and so are some of the smallest, such as adult [[sprat]]s and [[Anchovy|anchovies]].<ref name=\"Moyle572\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 572</ref>\n\nOcean waters that are exceptionally clear contain little food. Areas of high productivity tend to be somewhat turbid from [[Algal bloom|plankton blooms]]. These attract the filter feeding plankton eaters, which in turn attract the higher predators. Tuna fishing tends to be optimum when water turbidity, measured by the maximum depth a [[secchi disc]] can be seen during a sunny day, is 15 to 35 metres.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blackburn | year = 1965 | title = Oceanography and the ecology of tunas | url = | journal = Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 299\u2013322 }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Floating objects===\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = Sargassum weeds closeup.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Drifting ''[[Sargassum]]'' seaweed provides food and shelter for small epipelagic fish.

They aggregate in considerable numbers around objects such as drifting flotsam, rafts, jellyfish, and floating seaweed. The objects appear to provide a \"visual stimulus in an optical void\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hunter, JR |author2=Mitchell CT |year=1966|title=Association of fishes with flotsam in the offshore waters of Central America|journal=Fishery Bulletin|volume=66|pages=13\u201329}}</ref> Floating objects may offer [[refuge (ecology)|refuge]] for [[juvenile fish]] from predators.

Drifting seaweed, particularly the pelagic ''[[Sargassum]]'', provide a niche habitat with its own shelter and food, and even supports its own unique fauna, such as the [[sargassum fish]].<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/> One study, off Florida, found 54 species from 23 families living in flotsam from ''Sargassum'' mats.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dooley JK |year=1972|title=Fishes associated with the pelagic sargassum complex, with a discussion of the sargassum community|journal=Contributions in Marine Science|volume=16|pages=1\u201332}}</ref> Jellyfish also are used by juvenile fish for shelter and food, even though jellyfish can prey on small fish.<ref name=\"Moyle576\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 576</ref>\n\nMobile oceanic species such as [[tuna]] can be captured by travelling long distances in large [[fishing vessel]]s. A simpler alternative is to leverage off the fascination fish have with floating objects. When fishermen use such objects, they are called [[fish aggregating device]]s (FADs). FADs are anchored rafts or objects of any type, floating on the surface or just below it. Fishermen in the Pacific and Indian oceans set up floating FADs, assembled from all sorts of debris, around tropical islands, and then use [[purse seine]]s to capture the fish attracted to them.<ref name=\"Moyle574/5\" />\n\nA study using [[Fisheries acoustics|sonar]] in French Polynesia, found large shoals of juvenile [[bigeye tuna]] and [[yellowfin tuna]] aggregated closest to the devices, 10 to 50 m. Farther out, 50 to 150 m, was a less dense group of larger yellowfin and [[albacore tuna]]. Yet farther out, to 500 m, was a dispersed group of various large adult tuna. The distribution and density of these groups was variable and overlapped. The FADs also were used by other fish, and the aggregations dispersed when it was dark.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0990-7440(00)00051-6| title = Typologie et comportement des agr\u00e9gations thoni\u00e8res autour de dispositifs de concentration de poissons \u00e0 partir de prospections acoustiques en Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise| journal = Aquatic Living Resources| volume = 13| issue = 4| pages = 183\u2013192| year = 2000| last1 = Josse | first1 = E. }}</ref>\n\nLarger fish, even predator fish such as the [[great barracuda]], often attract a retinue of small fish that accompany them in a strategically safe way.

Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal fish that are not demersal fish, are usually epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone.<ref name=\"Moyle585\"/>\n\nCoastal epipelagic fish are among the most abundant in the world. They include forage fish as well as the predator fish that feed on them. Forage fish thrive in those inshore waters where high productivity results from the upwelling and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries, and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Oceanic fish==\n[[File:Oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|400px|right|Oceanic fish inhabit the [[oceanic zone]], which is the deep open water which lies beyond the continental shelves]]\n\nOceanic fish (also called open ocean or offshore fish) live in the waters that are not above the continental shelf. Oceanic fish can be contrasted with [[coastal fish]], who do live above the continental shelf. However, the two types are not mutually exclusive, since there are no firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions, and many epipelagic fish move between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages in their life cycle.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\nOceanic epipelagic fish can be true residents, partial residents, or accidental residents. True residents live their entire life in the open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as [[tuna]], [[billfish]], [[flying fish]], [[sauries]], [[Pilot fish|pilotfish]], [[remora]]s, [[dolphin]]s, ocean sharks, and [[ocean sunfish]]. Most of these species migrate back and forth across open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\nPartial residents occur in three groups: species that live in the zone only when they are juveniles (drifting with jellyfish and seaweeds); species that live in the zone only when they are adults (salmon, flying fish, dolphin, and whale sharks); and deep water species that make nightly migrations up into the surface waters (such as the [[lanternfish]]).<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/> Accidental residents occur occasionally when adults and juveniles of species from other environments are carried accidentally into the zone by currents.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"187px\">\nFile:Sunfish.jpg|The huge [[ocean sunfish]], a true resident of the ocean epipelagic zone, sometimes drifts with the current, eating [[jellyfish]]\nFile:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|The giant [[whale shark]], another resident of the ocean epipelagic zone, filter feeds on [[plankton]], and periodically dives deep into the mesopelagic zone\nFile:Protomyctophum subparallelum (no common name).gif|[[Lanternfish]] are partial residents of the ocean epipelagic zone, during the day they hide in deep waters, but at night they migrate up to surface waters to feed\n</gallery>\n\n===Deep water fish===\n[[File:Wfm pelagic.png|thumb|160px|right|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]\n{{See also|Deep sea fish}}\n\nIn the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper zones.<ref name=\"Moyle585\"/>\n\nIn deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic [[detritus]] falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot, and other inorganic dust. The \"snowflakes\" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]], and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow can be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.\n\nSome deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s, and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species that also aew attracted to the structures.\n\nThe fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s.<ref name=\"Moyle591\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 591</ref>\n\n[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Haedrich1996\"/> The few ray fins that do exist, are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which also are ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.<ref name=\"Moyle586\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 586</ref>\n\nMany species move daily between zones in vertical migrations.

This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and may become shallower when clouds pass over the moon.

They feed on small pelagic forage fish, as well as medium-sized pelagic fish. At times, they follow their schooling prey, and many species form schools themselves.\n\nExamples of larger pelagic fish are [[tuna]], [[billfish]], [[king mackerel]], sharks, and large [[Ray-finned fish|ray]]s.\n\nTuna in particular are of major importance to commercial fisheries. Although tuna migrate across oceans, trying to find them there is not the usual approach. Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant, along the boundaries of currents, around islands, near seamounts, and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes. Tuna are captured by several methods: [[Seiner|purse seine vessels]] enclose an entire surface school with special nets, [[Fishing vessel#Line vessels|pole and line vessels]] thay use poles baited with other smaller pelagic fish as [[baitfish]], and rafts called [[fish aggregating device]]s are set up, because tuna, as well as some other pelagic fish, tend to congregate under floating objects.<ref name=\"Lal8\"/>\n\nOther large pelagic fish are premier [[game fish]], particularly [[marlin]] and [[swordfish]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"187px\" heights=\"167px\">\nFile:Yellowfin tuna nurp.jpg|[[Yellowfin tuna]] are being fished as a replacement for the now largely depleted [[Southern bluefin tuna]]\nFile:Brama brama.jpg|[[Atlantic pomfret]]\nFile:Xiphias gladius1.jpg|[[Swordfish]]\nFile:Sccav_u0.gif|[[King mackerel]]s cruise on long migrations at 10 kilometres per hour <ref name=\"pfa\"/><ref name=\"Mackerel\"/>\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Ocean surface currents.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Major ocean surface currents]]\n[[File:upwelling image1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Areas of upwelling in red]]\n[[File:La Nina and Pacific Decadal Anomalies - April 2008.png|thumb|right|300px|Pacific decadal anomalies \u2013 April 2008]]\n\n===Productivity===\n[[Upwelling]] occurs both along coastlines and in midocean when a collision of deep [[ocean current]]s brings cold water that is rich in nutrients to the surface.

The upwelling stopped and [[phytoplankton]] production plummeted, as did the anchoveta population, and millions of [[seabird]]s, dependent on the anchoveta, died.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1075880| pmid = 12522241| title = From Anchovies to Sardines and Back: Multidecadal Change in the Pacific Ocean| journal = Science| volume = 299| issue = 5604| pages = 217\u201321| year = 2003| last1 = Chavez | first1 = F.

When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored the movements of the tuna for about a year, then detached and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, intermixing groups that between them, use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1061197|pmid=11509729|url=http://www.tunaresearch.org/reprints/migratory2001.pdf| title = Migratory Movements, Depth Preferences, and Thermal Biology of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna| journal = Science| volume = 293| issue = 5533| pages = 1310\u20134| year = 2001| last1 = Block | first1 = B.

The [[epipelagic zone]] is the water from the surface of the sea down to 200 metres. It is also referred to as the '''surface waters''' or the '''sunlit zone''', and includes the [[photic zone]]. The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1% of the surface value. This depth depends on how [[turbid]] the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with the epipelagic zone. The [[photic zone]] has sufficient light for [[phytoplankton]] to [[photosynthese]].<ref name=\"Moyle571\"/>\n\nThe epipelagic zone is vast, and is the home for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and can be a good habitat for [[algae]] to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat diversity results in a lack of [[species diversity]], so the zone supports less than 2% of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the [[continental shelves]], where [[land runoff]] can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where [[upwelling]] moves nutrients into the area.<ref name=\"Moyle571\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 571</ref>\n\nEpipelagic fish can be divided broadly into small [[forage fish]] and larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. Forage fish [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] and [[Filter feeder|filter feed]] on [[plankton]]. Most epipelagic fish have streamlined bodies capable of sustained cruising on [[Fish migration|migrations]]. In general, predatory and forage fish share the same [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features. Predator fish are usually [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] with large mouths, smooth bodies, and deeply forked tails. Many use vision to prey on zooplankton or smaller fish, while others [[Filter feeder|filter feed]] on [[plankton]].\n\n[[File:Herring Silvering.svg|thumb|160px|left|[[Herring]] reflectors are nearly vertical for camouflage from the side]]\n\nMost epipelagic predator fish and their smaller prey fish are [[countershading|countershaded]] with silvery colours that reduce visibility by scattering incoming light.<ref name=\"Moyle571\"/> The silvering is achieved with reflective [[fish scale]]s that function as small mirrors. This may give an effect of transparency. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror that is oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side.<ref name=Herring2002>Herring, Peter (2002) ''The Biology of the Deep Ocean'', pp. 192\u2013195, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-854956-7}}.</ref>\n\nIn the shallower epipelagic waters, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly, has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.<ref name=Herring2002/>\n\nAlthough the number of species is limited, epipelagic fishes are abundant. What they lack in diversity they make up for, in numbers. Forage fish occur in huge numbers, and large fish that prey on them often are sought after as premier [[Fish (food)|food fish]]. As a group, epipelagic fishes form the most valuable [[fisheries]] in the world.<ref name=\"Moyle571\"/>\n\nMany forage fish are facultative predators that can pick individual [[copepod]]s or fish larvae out of the water column, and then change to filter feeding on [[phytoplankton]] when energetically, that gives better results. Filter feeding fish usually use long fine [[gill raker]]s to strain small organisms from the water column. Some of the largest epipelagic fishes, such as the [[basking shark]] and [[whale shark]], are filter feeders, and so are some of the smallest, such as adult [[sprat]]s and [[Anchovy|anchovies]].<ref name=\"Moyle572\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 572</ref>\n\nOcean waters that are exceptionally clear contain little food. Areas of high productivity tend to be somewhat turbid from [[Algal bloom|plankton blooms]]. These attract the filter feeding plankton eaters, which in turn attract the higher predators. Tuna fishing tends to be optimum when water turbidity, measured by the maximum depth a [[secchi disc]] can be seen during a sunny day, is 15 to 35 metres.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blackburn | year = 1965 | title = Oceanography and the ecology of tunas | url = | journal = Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 299\u2013322 }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Floating objects===\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = Sargassum weeds closeup.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Drifting ''[[Sargassum]]'' seaweed provides food and shelter for small epipelagic fish.

Drifting seaweed, particularly the pelagic ''[[Sargassum]]'', provide a niche habitat with its own shelter and food, and even supports its own unique fauna, such as the [[sargassum fish]].<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/> One study, off Florida, found 54 species from 23 families living in flotsam from ''Sargassum'' mats.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dooley JK |year=1972|title=Fishes associated with the pelagic sargassum complex, with a discussion of the sargassum community|journal=Contributions in Marine Science|volume=16|pages=1\u201332}}</ref> Jellyfish also are used by juvenile fish for shelter and food, even though jellyfish can prey on small fish.<ref name=\"Moyle576\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 576</ref>\n\nMobile oceanic species such as [[tuna]] can be captured by travelling long distances in large [[fishing vessel]]s. A simpler alternative is to leverage off the fascination fish have with floating objects. When fishermen use such objects, they are called [[fish aggregating device]]s (FADs). FADs are anchored rafts or objects of any type, floating on the surface or just below it.

Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal fish that are not demersal fish, are usually epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone.<ref name=\"Moyle585\"/>\n\nCoastal epipelagic fish are among the most abundant in the world. They include forage fish as well as the predator fish that feed on them. Forage fish thrive in those inshore waters where high productivity results from the upwelling and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries, and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Oceanic fish==\n[[File:Oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|400px|right|Oceanic fish inhabit the [[oceanic zone]], which is the deep open water which lies beyond the continental shelves]]\n\nOceanic fish (also called open ocean or offshore fish) live in the waters that are not above the continental shelf. Oceanic fish can be contrasted with [[coastal fish]], who do live above the continental shelf. However, the two types are not mutually exclusive, since there are no firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions, and many epipelagic fish move between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages in their life cycle.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\nOceanic epipelagic fish can be true residents, partial residents, or accidental residents. True residents live their entire life in the open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as [[tuna]], [[billfish]], [[flying fish]], [[sauries]], [[Pilot fish|pilotfish]], [[remora]]s, [[dolphin]]s, ocean sharks, and [[ocean sunfish]]. Most of these species migrate back and forth across open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\nPartial residents occur in three groups: species that live in the zone only when they are juveniles (drifting with jellyfish and seaweeds); species that live in the zone only when they are adults (salmon, flying fish, dolphin, and whale sharks); and deep water species that make nightly migrations up into the surface waters (such as the [[lanternfish]]).<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/> Accidental residents occur occasionally when adults and juveniles of species from other environments are carried accidentally into the zone by currents.<ref name=\"Moyle572\"/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"187px\">\nFile:Sunfish.jpg|The huge [[ocean sunfish]], a true resident of the ocean epipelagic zone, sometimes drifts with the current, eating [[jellyfish]]\nFile:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|The giant [[whale shark]], another resident of the ocean epipelagic zone, filter feeds on [[plankton]], and periodically dives deep into the mesopelagic zone\nFile:Protomyctophum subparallelum (no common name).gif|[[Lanternfish]] are partial residents of the ocean epipelagic zone, during the day they hide in deep waters, but at night they migrate up to surface waters to feed\n</gallery>\n\n===Deep water fish===\n[[File:Wfm pelagic.png|thumb|160px|right|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]\n{{See also|Deep sea fish}}\n\nIn the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper zones.<ref name=\"Moyle585\"/>\n\nIn deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic [[detritus]] falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot, and other inorganic dust. The \"snowflakes\" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]], and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow can be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.\n\nSome deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s, and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species that also aew attracted to the structures.\n\nThe fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s.<ref name=\"Moyle591\">[[#Moyle|Moyle and Cech]], p. 591</ref>\n\n[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Haedrich1996\"/> The few ray fins that do exist, are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which also are ancient forms.

Between 200 metres and approximately 1000 metres, light continues to fade until there is almost none. Temperatures fall through a [[thermocline]] to temperatures between {{convert|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. This is the '''twilight''' or [[mesopelagic]] zone.

This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and may become shallower when clouds pass over the moon. This phenomenon has come to be known as the [[deep scattering layer]].<ref name=\"TeAraMZ\">Ryan P [http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/SeaLife/DeepSeaCreatures/2/en \"Deep-sea creatures: The mesopelagic zone\"] ''Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''.

[[Ambush predator]]s are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use [[Countershading|countershaded]] silvery colours. On their bellies, they often display [[photophore]]s producing low grade light.

These are high [[trophic level]] species that undertake migrations of significant, but variable distances across oceans for feeding, often on forage fish, or reproduction, and also have wide geographic distributions. Thus, these species are found both inside the {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[exclusive economic zone]]s and in the [[high seas]] outside these zones. They are [[pelagic]] species, which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor, although they may spend part of their life cycle in [[nearshore waters]].<ref>[[Pacific Fishery Management Council]]: [http://www.pcouncil.org/hms/hmsback.html Background:  Highly Migratory Species]</ref>\n\n===Capture production===\nAccording to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[Fishing by country|world harvest]] in 2005 consisted of 93.2 million [[tonne]]s captured by [[commercial fishing]] in [[wild fisheries]].<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fishery/ Fisheries and Aquaculture].

Former Philippine president [[Elpidio Quirino]], the sixth [[President of the Philippines]], was born in Vigan, at the former location of the Provincial Jail (his father was a warden); he resided in the Syquia Mansion. The entire city of Vigan was later inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage City]] after being declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a member of the [[Organization of World Heritage Cities]] (OWHC).\n\nIn May 2015, Vigan City was officially recognized as one of the [[New7WondersCities|New7Wonders Cities]] together with [[Beirut]], [[Doha]], [[Durban]], [[Havana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[La Paz]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/05/09/1452765/vigan-declared-wonder-city?nomobile=1 |author=Tejada, Ariel Paolo |title=Vigan declared 'Wonder City' |date=9 May 2015 |newspaper=The Philippine STAR |location=Manila |accessdate=19 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128131839/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/05/09/1452765/vigan-declared-wonder-city?nomobile=1 |archive-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> New7Wonders Foundation president and founding member Bernard Weber led a ceremony held at [[Vigan Cathedral|St. Paul Cathedral]] where he handed a bronze plaque to Vigan Mayor Eva Grace Singson-Medina, signifying the heritage city's election as one of the world's wonder cities.<ref name=\"editorialinsider.com\">[http://editorialinsider.com/vigan-named-as-one-of-the-new7wonders/ Vigan named as one of the New7Wonders]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Vigan, Heritage City of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|Calle Crisologo in March 2012]]\nThe area of Vigan was originally a settlement of traders coming from the [[Fujian]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]. At the time of Spanish colonisation, the Chinese settlers, whose language was [[Southern Min]] ([[Min Nan]], often referred to as \"[[Philippine Hokkien|Hokkien]]\" by most Filipinos), referred to the area as ''Bee Gan'' ({{zh|c=\u7f8e\u5cb8|poj=b\u00ed-g\u0101n|p=m\u011bi'\u00e0n}}), which means \"Beautiful Shore.\" Since the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquistadors interchanged V and the B to refer to the /b/ sound, they spelled the Hokkien Chinese name \"Bee Gan\" as ''Vigan'', which is the name used to this day.\n\nVigan's Chinese heritage is still evident from the numerous elite Chinese creole families who come from the area, many of whom adopted Hispanic family names. Others, such as the Syquia family, have retained Chinese-derived surnames, though most, if not all, of the Christian Chinese creole families fully Hispanicised themselves culturally.\n\nThe most commonly known source of the city's name is from the Biga'a plant, which once grew abundantly along the banks of the Mestizo River, from which captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] derived the city's name (after a misunderstanding with the locals, thinking he was asking the name of the plants).\n\n===Other names===\nThe city's full name at the time of its Spanish foundation was ''Villa Fernandina'', or \"Town of Ferdinand\", in honor of Prince [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias|Ferdinand]], the firstborn son of King [[Philip II of Spain]]. As the city grew, and the seat of the [[Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia]] transferred to Vigan, it was later renamed ''Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan'' (\"Ferdinand's City of Vigan/Fernandine City of Vigan\").\n\n==History==\n\nDue to silting of the Mestizo River, Vigan City is no longer separated from the mainland, therefore no longer an island. The city is unique in the Philippines because it is one of many extensive surviving Philippine historic cities, dating back to the 16th century.\n\nVigan was a coastal trading post long before the Spaniards arrived; Chinese traders sailing from the West Philippine Sea came to ''Isla de Vigan'' (Island of Vigan) via the Mestizo River that surrounded it. On board their ships were seafaring merchants who came to trade goods from other Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax, and other mountain products brought by the indigenous peoples from the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera region]].\n\nIn the book ''The Philippine Island'' (Vol. III, p.&nbsp;276, Blair and Robertson) two letters from [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Guido de Lavezaris]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]] mention: \"It seemed best to send Captain Juan de Salcedo with 70 or 80 soldiers to explore the coast of Los Ilocanos on the shores of the river called Bigan.\" The Spaniards led by Salcedo marched north from Manila on May 20, 1572. They arrived in Vigan on June 13, 1572.<ref name=IlocosHeritage>{{cite book|last1=De la Torre|first1=Visitacion|title=The Ilocos Heritage|date=2006|publisher=Tower Book House|location=Makati City|isbn=978-971-91030-9-7|page=2}}</ref>\n\nThus, after the successful expedition and the exploration of the North, Juan de Salcedo founded \"Villa Fernandina de Vigan\" in honor of King Philip II's son, Prince Ferdinand, who died at the age of four. From Vigan, Salcedo rounded the tip of Luz\u00f3n and proceeded to pacify [[Camarines]], [[Albay]], and [[Catanduanes]]. As a reward for his services to the [[King of Spain]], Salcedo was awarded the [[Ilocos|old province of Ilocos]], which consisted of the modern provinces of [[Ilocos Norte]], Ilocos Sur, [[Abra (province)|Abra]], [[La Union]] and part of [[Mountain Province]] as his [[hacienda]] (estate), and was accorded the title of ''Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos'' (Province Mayor of Ilocos).\n\nIn 1574, Salcedo returned to the capital of his ''[[encomienda]]'' (trusteeship), Vigan, bringing with him his soldiers and some [[Augustinian]] missionaries to pioneer the evangelization of the Ilocos region. He established a Spanish city for the purpose of controlling the neighboring country.\n\nGovernor General [[G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez Dasmari\u00f1as]], in his account of ''encomienda'' dated in Manila on May 31, 1591, states: \"The town of Vigan called ''Villa Fernandina'' consisted of Spanish settlers; a priest; a Justice Alcalde Mayor (Governor); and a Deputy. The King collects 800 tributes (equivalent to 3,200 subjects).\" During this period, Vigan was composed of 19 ''barrio''s (districts).\n\nBetween 1645 and 1660, Vigan was divided into 21 ''Cabezas de Barrio'' (Town Mayors) as mentioned in the ''Libro de Casamiento'' (Book of Marriage); from the records of the parish house of Vigan found in its archives. Separated from the indigenous population, the Chinese migrants were residents in a neighbourhood called El Pariancillo, los Sangleyes del parian (The Sangleyes of the Parian); and the Spanish settlers were residents in a town called ''Los Espa\u00f1oles de la Villa'' (The Town Spaniards).\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], revolutionary forces under [[Manuel Tinio]], supported by the Ilocano rebels, attacked and defeated the Spanish colonial forces and captured the city in the Siege of Vigan. During the [[Philippine-American War]], American forces led by Commander McCracken and Lt. Col. [[James Parker (Medal of Honor)|James Parker]] occupied the town in Nov. 1899.\n\nAt the start of [[World War II]], Vigan was one of the first places in the Philippines [[Japanese invasion of Vigan|invaded by Japan]] on 10 December 1941. In 1945, combined U.S. and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] ground troops, aided by Ilocano resistance fighters, defeated the [[Japanese Imperial forces]] and liberated Vigan.\n\nIn 1999, Vigan was listed by [[UNESCO]] as the best preserved example of Spanish colonial towns in Asia. Its architecture is the conglomeration of cultural elements from the Philippines, China, and Spain, making it unique in the world.\n\nRepublic Act No. 8988 of December 27, 2000 \"revalidated and recognized\" Vigan's city status granted by royal decree in the mid 18th century. This legislation serves as Vigan's present city charter.\n\nOn December 7, 2014, Vigan was named as one of the ''[[New7WondersCities|New7Wonders Cities]]''.\n\n==Geography==\nVigan can be found 120 23\u2019 15\u2019\u2019 east longitude and 17 34\u2019 30\u2019\u2019 north latitude. It is situated in the northern part of Luzon, the Philippines\u2019 largest island. It serves as the capital of Ilocos Sur and has been a major political and trading center since before the Spanish colonizers arrived in the Philippines.\n\nIts favorable geographical features and location continues to make it a very accessible center. It is {{convert|407|km|mi}} away from [[Manila]], {{convert|82|km|mi}} away from [[Laoag City]], and {{convert|138|km|mi}} away from [[San Fernando, La Union]], the regional capital of Ilocos Region.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Vigan coast 3.jpg|thumb|Vigan coast]]\nIts 2,511 hectares of land consists mostly of plains with gentle hills. Its boundaries on the north, east, south, and west are the municipalities of [[Bantay, Ilocos Sur|Bantay]], [[Santa, Ilocos Sur|Santa]], [[Caoayan, Ilocos Sur|Caoayan]], and [[Santa Catalina, Ilocos Sur|Santa Catalina]], respectively. The [[South China Sea]] is on its southwest portion.\n\nMajority of its land, 60 percent of it, is used for agriculture. Around 32 percent is made up of residential area, nearly three percent are for commercial and industrial use, and around one percent is for institutional purposes. There are also forest reserves and fishponds included in Vigan's land area.\n\nVigan is made up of 39 barangays. Thirty of them are classified as rural, but they occupy only 2,366 hectares. The remaining nine are classified as ''[[poblacion]]'' barangays and are together 144.75 hectares big.\n\nThe barangays of Pagburnayan, Paoa, and Tamag are on the area of rolling plains. On the other hand, portions of Barangays Tamag and the barangays of Bulala and Salindeg are found on the city's hilly parts.\n\nIts most dominant hill feature is the Vigan Gap Hill in the eastern part, just 10 kilometers away from the city. Vigan used to be separated from the rest of the mainland by the rivers of [[Abra River|Abra]], Mestizo and Govantes, making it an island during that time. The Govantes River cuts the current Vigan plain from North to South.\n\nThe large Abra and Mestizo rivers, together with the rivers of Bantay, Bantaoay, Nauman and Santo Tomas serve as part of a network that drain the Vigan plains. These rivers are not only important in safekeeping the city from floods, they also served as important ways of transport for trade-related activities from the 15th century to the 19th century, that helped make Vigan a thriving center. The most vital of these rivers is said to be the Mestizo River which was used by the small vessels to transport goods and people.\n\nThere is a faulting trend in the Vigan plain that ends in Santa Catalina.\n\n===Soil type===\nThe land area of Vigan is generally flat. Slopes of 20 are found at Barangay V, Tamag, and Paoa. There are no forest reserves in the city in terms of potential and raw materials. Bamboo is the only forest product in Vigan.\n\nThere are five soil types in the city. First, the ''Bantay Loam'', located at the southern portion of Raois, has a land area of 36.67 hectares, and is good as pastureland. The second, ''Umingan sandy'', with a land area of 1191.57 hectares, is good for upland rice and vegetables. The third, ''San Manuel clay loam'', which is best for bananas, cotton and vegetables, has an area of 1244.57 hectares. The fourth, ''Bantog clay''\u2014considered as the most significant type for soil, and the best clay material for making pots, jars and all earthenware, has a land area of 31.65 hectares. The fifth, ''beach sand'', with a land area of 7.28 hectares, is generally found on the shores of all the beaches of Vigan, and is best for coconut plantation.\n\n===Barangays===\n\nVigan City is subdivided into 39 [[barrio]]s or [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n[[File:Vigan Barangay Map.png|center|500px|The Barangay map of the City of Vigan]]\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Ayusan Norte\n*Ayusan Sur\n*Barangay I (''[[Poblacion]]'')\n*Barangay II (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay III (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay IV (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay V (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay VI (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay VII (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay VIII (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay IX (''Poblacion'')\n*Barraca\n*Beddeng Daya\n*Beddeng Laud\n*Bongtolan\n*Bulala\n*Cabalangegan\n*Cabaroan Daya\n*Cabaroan Laud\n*Camangaan\n*Capangpangan\n*Mindoro\n*Nagsangalan\n*Pantay Daya\n*Pantay Fatima\n*Pantay Laud\n*Paoa\n*Paratong\n*Pong-ol\n*Purok-a-bassit\n*Purok-a-dackel\n*Raois\n*Rugsuanan\n*[[Salindeg]]\n*San Jose\n*San Julian Norte\n*San Julian Sur\n*San Pedro\n*Tamag\n{{colend}}\n\n===Urban structures===\n[[File:Plaza Salcedo Vigan Church.jpg|thumb|Plaza Salcedo and [[Vigan Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Vigan Cathedral, Vigan , Ilocos Sur.JPG|thumb|[[Vigan Cathedral|Saint Paul's Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Ilocos Sur Capitol.jpg|thumb|Ilocos Sur Capitol]]\n[[File:WIKI-2012-negdelacruz-VIGAN-bricks 04.jpg|thumb|Calle Crisologo at night]]\n[[File:Plaza Burgos.jpg|thumb|Plaza [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]]]\nWhen [[Juan de Salcedo]] founded Vigan in 1572, he decided to pattern its urban plan with that of [[Intramuros]], the walled city in [[Manila]].\n\nThe urban planners of the Spanish government also followed a basic pattern that can be observed in most old towns in the country, whose establishment dates back to the Spanish colonial period. This pattern is detailed in the ''Ley de las Indias,'' the [[Laws of the Indies|Law of the Indies]], and was put into force in the 18th century. Under the Law of the Indies streets were to follow a grid pattern, the center of which being a [[plaza]] or central park.\n\nIn Vigan, the central park is the [[Plaza Salcedo]]. Next to it are the administrative buildings\u2014the Casa Real or provincial administrative office, and the ''municipio'' ([[municipal hall]]). A stone's throw away are the religious buildings\u2014the seminary of the archdiocese, the Arzobispado (Archbishop's Palace), and the [[Vigan Cathedral|St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Beside these religious structures is the church-run school, the Saint Paul College, known in its early days as the ''Colegio de Ni\u00f1as.'' After the full transfer of the said school to the neighboring towns of [[Bantay, Ilocos Sur|Bantay]] and [[San Vicente, Ilocos Sur|San Vicente]], the building was handed over to the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia and is currently being occupied by a retail store chain, with only a commemorative plaque at the building's entrance and the old \"ROSARY COLLEGE\" concrete sign at its rear reminding visitors of its past (the school's old logo, once found at the building's facade, has been removed sometime later).\n\nA unique thing is the existence of another plaza, the ''Plaza Burgos'', which is immediately beside the St. Paul's Cathedral. After the first tier emanating from Plaza Salcedo are the houses of prominent residents that now make up the preserved heritage houses of Vigan. This urban plan remained relatively intact despite wars and natural calamities that have been endured by Vigan since its foundation.\n\nThe major changes to the original urban landscape were caused by fires. The Casa Real was replaced with a provincial capitol building during the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American period]] when the original structure burned down. The archdiocese seminary was also destroyed by fire in 1968, and it lay in ruins until the late 1990s, when part of a shopping mall was built on the site.\n\nThe residential areas were not spared. Some of the houses on Crisologo Street were casualties of fire during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese period]]; several houses on Quezon Avenue were destroyed by fire as well in 1952; while in 1971, some houses near Plaza Burgos burned down as well. The houses along Crisologo Street that were burned were later reconstructed faithfully following the architecture of the former structures.\n\nPresently, there are other major areas of activities other than the two plazas, though these are still where most recreation and shopping are done. One may also go to the southern part of the city to reach the commercial area and public market. The current Public Market is a new one, as the old one (formerly the [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]] Socio-Commercial Complex), on the same site, was (also) destroyed by fire. A new mall (opened in December 2017) has risen from the site of the city's first Public Market, found in the center of the business district, after being the site of some business establishments and a tricycle-for-hire terminal.\n\n===Geologic base and mineral resources===\nThe sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that are present in the city are [[alluvium]], fluviatile, lacuatine, pludal and beach deposits such as coral, stools, and beach rock. These are predominantly found along the coastal areas of Vigan. An important non-metallic mineral resource found in Vigan is the kind of clay that is used in making earthen jars locally called ''burnay.'' Earthenware of different uses and sizes are made of this kind of clay. Known as ''Bantog clay'', the mineral is the basic material in making [[brick]]s. These bricks are the original materials in building the  Hispanic houses of Vigan.\n\n===Physiography===\nVigan is situated in a Quaternary Age sedimentary plain called the Vigan-Bantay Plain which is part of the Ilocos coastal plain. The Vigan-Bantay Plain is bounded on the east by a moderately rugged Miocene sediments consisting of interbedded [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]] to very rugged Meta-volcanics and Meta sediment topography; on the south is [[Santa, Ilocos Sur|the Municipality of Santa]] where the north\u2013south trending fault terminates; to the west is the South China Sea; while the northern boundary opens to the northern extension of the Ilocos coastal plain.\n\nThe central part of the plain is characterized by a dissected ridge of [[Plio-Pleistocene]] age that trends in a northeast\u2013southwest direction. The ridge divides the Vigan-Bantay Plain into northern and southern plains.\n\nThe northern part of the plain is drained by minor rivers namely: Bantaoay, Santo Tomas, and Nauman rivers, while the [[Abra River]] is the main drainage network of the southern portion of the plain. The Abra River meanders into the hinterland but exhibits a braided pattern across the plain.\n\nThe drainage network of the eastern margin of Vigan-Bantay plain consist of deeply cut valleys whose pattern is strongly controlled by main faulting trends, particularly those in the northerly and easterly directions.\n\nVigan is being drained by the Vigan River and Bantay River, respectively, on the north and on the south by Mestizo River whose water discharge comes from the Bantaoay head waters.\n\nThe relief of the Vigan-Bantay plain is actively level to undulating with a slope ranging from 0% to 8%. Vigan in particular is generally in level with several hills in Barangays Tamag, Bulala, and Salindeg, sometimes reaching about 50 meters in elevation and has a slope ranging from 3% to 8%.\n\nThe eastern margin of the plain characterized by a steep to very steep slope, about 40% to 60%, the relief often reaches an elevation of more that 600 meters especially the northerly and easterly portion.\n\nThe dominant topographic feature in the eastern margin of the town is the Vigan Gap Hill where the continuously shifting Vigan River cuts its way. The Gap Hill is located approximately 10 kilometers east of Vigan.\n\n===Weather and climate===\nThe city of Vigan falls under ([[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna]]), which is characterized by two pronounced seasons \u2013 the dry season which starts from the month of November and ends in April; and the wet season which spans the months of May to October.

Former Philippine president [[Elpidio Quirino]], the sixth [[President of the Philippines]], was born in Vigan, at the former location of the Provincial Jail (his father was a warden); he resided in the Syquia Mansion. The entire city of Vigan was later inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage City]] after being declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a member of the [[Organization of World Heritage Cities]] (OWHC).\n\nIn May 2015, Vigan City was officially recognized as one of the [[New7WondersCities|New7Wonders Cities]] together with [[Beirut]], [[Doha]], [[Durban]], [[Havana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[La Paz]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/05/09/1452765/vigan-declared-wonder-city?nomobile=1 |author=Tejada, Ariel Paolo |title=Vigan declared 'Wonder City' |date=9 May 2015 |newspaper=The Philippine STAR |location=Manila |accessdate=19 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128131839/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/05/09/1452765/vigan-declared-wonder-city?nomobile=1 |archive-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> New7Wonders Foundation president and founding member Bernard Weber led a ceremony held at [[Vigan Cathedral|St. Paul Cathedral]] where he handed a bronze plaque to Vigan Mayor Eva Grace Singson-Medina, signifying the heritage city\u2019s election as one of the world\u2019s wonder cities.<ref name=\"editorialinsider.com\">[http://editorialinsider.com/vigan-named-as-one-of-the-new7wonders/ Vigan named as one of the New7Wonders]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Vigan, Heritage City of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|Calle Crisologo in March 2012]]\nThe area of Vigan was originally a settlement of traders coming from the [[Fujian]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]. At the time of Spanish colonisation, the Chinese settlers, whose language was [[Southern Min]] ([[Min Nan]], often referred to as \"[[Philippine Hokkien|Hokkien]]\" by most Filipinos), referred to the area as ''Bee Gan'' ({{zh|c=\u7f8e\u5cb8|poj=b\u00ed-g\u0101n|p=m\u011bi'\u00e0n}}), which means \"Beautiful Shore.\" Since the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquistadors interchanged V and the B to refer to the /b/ sound, they spelled the Hokkien Chinese name \"Bee Gan\" as ''Vigan'', which is the name used to this day.\n\nVigan's Chinese heritage is still evident from the numerous elite Chinese creole families who come from the area, many of whom adopted Hispanic family names. Others, such as the Syquia family, have retained Chinese-derived surnames, though most, if not all, of the Christian Chinese creole families fully Hispanicised themselves culturally.\n\nThe most commonly known source of the city's name is from the Biga'a plant, which once grew abundantly along the banks of the Mestizo River, from which captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] derived the city's name (after a misunderstanding with the locals, thinking he was asking the name of the plants).\n\n===Other names===\nThe city's full name at the time of its Spanish foundation was ''Villa Fernandina'', or \"Town of Ferdinand\", in honor of Prince [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias|Ferdinand]], the firstborn son of King [[Philip II of Spain]]. As the city grew, and the seat of the [[Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia]] transferred to Vigan, it was later renamed ''Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan'' (\"Ferdinand's City of Vigan/Fernandine City of Vigan\").\n\n==History==\n\nDue to silting of the Mestizo River, Vigan City is no longer separated from the mainland, therefore no longer an island. The city is unique in the Philippines because it is one of many extensive surviving Philippine historic cities, dating back to the 16th century.\n\nVigan was a coastal trading post long before the Spaniards arrived; Chinese traders sailing from the West Philippine Sea came to ''Isla de Vigan'' (Island of Vigan) via the Mestizo River that surrounded it. On board their ships were seafaring merchants who came to trade goods from other Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax, and other mountain products brought by the indigenous peoples from the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera region]].\n\nIn the book ''The Philippine Island'' (Vol. III, p.&nbsp;276, Blair and Robertson) two letters from [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Guido de Lavezaris]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]] mention: \"It seemed best to send Captain Juan de Salcedo with 70 or 80 soldiers to explore the coast of Los Ilocanos on the shores of the river called Bigan.\" The Spaniards led by Salcedo marched north from Manila on May 20, 1572. They arrived in Vigan on June 13, 1572.<ref name=IlocosHeritage>{{cite book|last1=De la Torre|first1=Visitacion|title=The Ilocos Heritage|date=2006|publisher=Tower Book House|location=Makati City|isbn=978-971-91030-9-7|page=2}}</ref>\n\nThus, after the successful expedition and the exploration of the North, Juan de Salcedo founded \"Villa Fernandina de Vigan\" in honor of King Philip II\u2019s son, Prince Ferdinand, who died at the age of four. From Vigan, Salcedo rounded the tip of Luz\u00f3n and proceeded to pacify [[Camarines]], [[Albay]], and [[Catanduanes]]. As a reward for his services to the [[King of Spain]], Salcedo was awarded the [[Ilocos|old province of Ilocos]], which consisted of the modern provinces of [[Ilocos Norte]], Ilocos Sur, [[Abra (province)|Abra]], [[La Union]] and part of [[Mountain Province]] as his [[hacienda]] (estate), and was accorded the title of ''Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos'' (Province Mayor of Ilocos).\n\nIn 1574, Salcedo returned to the capital of his ''[[encomienda]]'' (trusteeship), Vigan, bringing with him his soldiers and some [[Augustinian]] missionaries to pioneer the evangelization of the Ilocos region. He established a Spanish city for the purpose of controlling the neighboring country.\n\nGovernor General [[G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez Dasmari\u00f1as]], in his account of ''encomienda'' dated in Manila on May 31, 1591, states: \"The town of Vigan called ''Villa Fernandina'' consisted of Spanish settlers; a priest; a Justice Alcalde Mayor (Governor); and a Deputy. The King collects 800 tributes (equivalent to 3,200 subjects).\" During this period, Vigan was composed of 19 ''barrio''s (districts).\n\nBetween 1645 and 1660, Vigan was divided into 21 ''Cabezas de Barrio'' (Town Mayors) as mentioned in the ''Libro de Casamiento'' (Book of Marriage); from the records of the parish house of Vigan found in its archives. Separated from the indigenous population, the Chinese migrants were residents in a neighbourhood called El Pariancillo, los Sangleyes del parian (The Sangleyes of the Parian); and the Spanish settlers were residents in a town called ''Los Espa\u00f1oles de la Villa'' (The Town Spaniards).\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], revolutionary forces under [[Manuel Tinio]], supported by the Ilocano rebels, attacked and defeated the Spanish colonial forces and captured the city in the Siege of Vigan. During the [[Philippine-American War]], American forces led by Commander McCracken and Lt. Col. [[James Parker (Medal of Honor)|James Parker]] occupied the town in Nov. 1899.\n\nAt the start of [[World War II]], Vigan was one of the first places in the Philippines [[Japanese invasion of Vigan|invaded by Japan]] on 10 December 1941. In 1945, combined U.S. and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] ground troops, aided by Ilocano resistance fighters, defeated the [[Japanese Imperial forces]] and liberated Vigan.\n\nIn 1999, Vigan was listed by [[UNESCO]] as the best preserved example of Spanish colonial towns in Asia. Its architecture is the conglomeration of cultural elements from the Philippines, China, and Spain, making it unique in the world.\n\nRepublic Act No. 8988 of December 27, 2000 \"revalidated and recognized\" Vigan's city status granted by royal decree in the mid 18th century. This legislation serves as Vigan's present city charter.\n\nOn December 7, 2014, Vigan was named as one of the ''[[New7WondersCities|New7Wonders Cities]]''.\n\n==Geography==\nVigan can be found 120 23\u2019 15\u2019\u2019 east longitude and 17 34\u2019 30\u2019\u2019 north latitude. It is situated in the northern part of Luzon, the Philippines\u2019 largest island. It serves as the capital of Ilocos Sur and has been a major political and trading center since before the Spanish colonizers arrived in the Philippines.\n\nIts favorable geographical features and location continues to make it a very accessible center. It is {{convert|407|km|mi}} away from [[Manila]], {{convert|82|km|mi}} away from [[Laoag City]], and {{convert|138|km|mi}} away from [[San Fernando, La Union]], the regional capital of Ilocos Region.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Vigan coast 3.jpg|thumb|Vigan coast]]\nIts 2,511 hectares of land consists mostly of plains with gentle hills. Its boundaries on the north, east, south, and west are the municipalities of [[Bantay, Ilocos Sur|Bantay]], [[Santa, Ilocos Sur|Santa]], [[Caoayan, Ilocos Sur|Caoayan]], and [[Santa Catalina, Ilocos Sur|Santa Catalina]], respectively. The [[South China Sea]] is on its southwest portion.\n\nMajority of its land, 60 percent of it, is used for agriculture. Around 32 percent is made up of residential area, nearly three percent are for commercial and industrial use, and around one percent is for institutional purposes. There are also forest reserves and fishponds included in Vigan\u2019s land area.\n\nVigan is made up of 39 barangays. Thirty of them are classified as rural, but they occupy only 2,366 hectares. The remaining nine are classified as ''[[poblacion]]'' barangays and are together 144.75 hectares big.\n\nThe barangays of Pagburnayan, Paoa, and Tamag are on the area of rolling plains. On the other hand, portions of Barangays Tamag and the barangays of Bulala and Salindeg are found on the city's hilly parts.\n\nIts most dominant hill feature is the Vigan Gap Hill in the eastern part, just 10 kilometers away from the city. Vigan used to be separated from the rest of the mainland by the rivers of [[Abra River|Abra]], Mestizo and Govantes, making it an island during that time. The Govantes River cuts the current Vigan plain from North to South.\n\nThe large Abra and Mestizo rivers, together with the rivers of Bantay, Bantaoay, Nauman and Santo Tomas serve as part of a network that drain the Vigan plains. These rivers are not only important in safekeeping the city from floods, they also served as important ways of transport for trade-related activities from the 15th century to the 19th century, that helped make Vigan a thriving center. The most vital of these rivers is said to be the Mestizo River which was used by the small vessels to transport goods and people.\n\nThere is a faulting trend in the Vigan plain that ends in Santa Catalina.\n\n===Soil type===\nThe land area of Vigan is generally flat. Slopes of 20 are found at Barangay V, Tamag, and Paoa. There are no forest reserves in the city in terms of potential and raw materials. Bamboo is the only forest product in Vigan.\n\nThere are five soil types in the city. First, the ''Bantay Loam'', located at the southern portion of Raois, has a land area of 36.67 hectares, and is good as pastureland. The second, ''Umingan sandy'', with a land area of 1191.57 hectares, is good for upland rice and vegetables. The third, ''San Manuel clay loam'', which is best for bananas, cotton and vegetables, has an area of 1244.57 hectares. The fourth, ''Bantog clay''\u2014considered as the most significant type for soil, and the best clay material for making pots, jars and all earthenware, has a land area of 31.65 hectares. The fifth, ''beach sand'', with a land area of 7.28 hectares, is generally found on the shores of all the beaches of Vigan, and is best for coconut plantation.\n\n===Barangays===\n\nVigan City is subdivided into 39 [[barrio]]s or [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n[[File:Vigan Barangay Map.png|center|500px|The Barangay map of the City of Vigan]]\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Ayusan Norte\n*Ayusan Sur\n*Barangay I (''[[Poblacion]]'')\n*Barangay II (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay III (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay IV (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay V (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay VI (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay VII (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay VIII (''Poblacion'')\n*Barangay IX (''Poblacion'')\n*Barraca\n*Beddeng Daya\n*Beddeng Laud\n*Bongtolan\n*Bulala\n*Cabalangegan\n*Cabaroan Daya\n*Cabaroan Laud\n*Camangaan\n*Capangpangan\n*Mindoro\n*Nagsangalan\n*Pantay Daya\n*Pantay Fatima\n*Pantay Laud\n*Paoa\n*Paratong\n*Pong-ol\n*Purok-a-bassit\n*Purok-a-dackel\n*Raois\n*Rugsuanan\n*[[Salindeg]]\n*San Jose\n*San Julian Norte\n*San Julian Sur\n*San Pedro\n*Tamag\n{{colend}}\n\n===Urban structures===\n[[File:Plaza Salcedo Vigan Church.jpg|thumb|Plaza Salcedo and [[Vigan Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Vigan Cathedral, Vigan , Ilocos Sur.JPG|thumb|[[Vigan Cathedral|Saint Paul's Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Ilocos Sur Capitol.jpg|thumb|Ilocos Sur Capitol]]\n[[File:WIKI-2012-negdelacruz-VIGAN-bricks 04.jpg|thumb|Calle Crisologo at night]]\n[[File:Plaza Burgos.jpg|thumb|Plaza [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]]]\nWhen [[Juan de Salcedo]] founded Vigan in 1572, he decided to pattern its urban plan with that of [[Intramuros]], the walled city in [[Manila]].\n\nThe urban planners of the Spanish government also followed a basic pattern that can be observed in most old towns in the country, whose establishment dates back to the Spanish colonial period. This pattern is detailed in the ''Ley de las Indias,'' the [[Laws of the Indies|Law of the Indies]], and was put into force in the 18th century. Under the Law of the Indies streets were to follow a grid pattern, the center of which being a [[plaza]] or central park.\n\nIn Vigan, the central park is the [[Plaza Salcedo]]. Next to it are the administrative buildings\u2014the Casa Real or provincial administrative office, and the ''municipio'' ([[municipal hall]]). A stone's throw away are the religious buildings\u2014the seminary of the archdiocese, the Arzobispado (Archbishop's Palace), and the [[Vigan Cathedral|St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Beside these religious structures is the church-run school, the Saint Paul College, known in its early days as the ''Colegio de Ni\u00f1as.'' After the full transfer of the said school to the neighboring towns of [[Bantay, Ilocos Sur|Bantay]] and [[San Vicente, Ilocos Sur|San Vicente]], the building was handed over to the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia and is currently being occupied by a retail store chain, with only a commemorative plaque at the building's entrance and the old \"ROSARY COLLEGE\" concrete sign at its rear reminding visitors of its past (the school's old logo, once found at the building's facade, has been removed sometime later).\n\nA unique thing is the existence of another plaza, the ''Plaza Burgos'', which is immediately beside the St. Paul's Cathedral. After the first tier emanating from Plaza Salcedo are the houses of prominent residents that now make up the preserved heritage houses of Vigan. This urban plan remained relatively intact despite wars and natural calamities that have been endured by Vigan since its foundation.\n\nThe major changes to the original urban landscape were caused by fires. The Casa Real was replaced with a provincial capitol building during the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American period]] when the original structure burned down. The archdiocese seminary was also destroyed by fire in 1968, and it lay in ruins until the late 1990s, when part of a shopping mall was built on the site.\n\nThe residential areas were not spared. Some of the houses on Crisologo Street were casualties of fire during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese period]]; several houses on Quezon Avenue were destroyed by fire as well in 1952; while in 1971, some houses near Plaza Burgos burned down as well. The houses along Crisologo Street that were burned were later reconstructed faithfully following the architecture of the former structures.\n\nPresently, there are other major areas of activities other than the two plazas, though these are still where most recreation and shopping are done. One may also go to the southern part of the city to reach the commercial area and public market. The current Public Market is a new one, as the old one (formerly the [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]] Socio-Commercial Complex), on the same site, was (also) destroyed by fire. A new mall (opened in December 2017) has risen from the site of the city's first Public Market, found in the center of the business district, after being the site of some business establishments and a tricycle-for-hire terminal.\n\n===Geologic base and mineral resources===\nThe sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that are present in the city are [[alluvium]], fluviatile, lacuatine, pludal and beach deposits such as coral, stools, and beach rock. These are predominantly found along the coastal areas of Vigan. An important non-metallic mineral resource found in Vigan is the kind of clay that is used in making earthen jars locally called ''burnay.'' Earthenware of different uses and sizes are made of this kind of clay. Known as ''Bantog clay'', the mineral is the basic material in making [[brick]]s. These bricks are the original materials in building the  Hispanic houses of Vigan.\n\n===Physiography===\nVigan is situated in a Quaternary Age sedimentary plain called the Vigan-Bantay Plain which is part of the Ilocos coastal plain. The Vigan-Bantay Plain is bounded on the east by a moderately rugged Miocene sediments consisting of interbedded [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]] to very rugged Meta-volcanics and Meta sediment topography; on the south is [[Santa, Ilocos Sur|the Municipality of Santa]] where the north-south trending fault terminates; to the west is the South China Sea; while the northern boundary opens to the northern extension of the Ilocos coastal plain.\n\nThe central part of the plain is characterized by a dissected ridge of [[Plio-Pleistocene]] age that trends in a northeast-southwest direction. The ridge divides the Vigan-Bantay Plain into northern and southern plains.\n\nThe northern part of the plain is drained by minor rivers namely: Bantaoay, Santo Tomas, and Nauman rivers, while the [[Abra River]] is the main drainage network of the southern portion of the plain. The Abra River meanders into the hinterland but exhibits a braided pattern across the plain.\n\nThe drainage network of the eastern margin of Vigan-Bantay plain consist of deeply cut valleys whose pattern is strongly controlled by main faulting trends, particularly those in the northerly and easterly directions.\n\nVigan is being drained by the Vigan River and Bantay River, respectively, on the north and on the south by Mestizo River whose water discharge comes from the Bantaoay head waters.\n\nThe relief of the Vigan-Bantay plain is actively level to undulating with a slope ranging from 0% to 8%. Vigan in particular is generally in level with several hills in Barangays Tamag, Bulala, and Salindeg, sometimes reaching about 50 meters in elevation and has a slope ranging from 3% to 8%.\n\nThe eastern margin of the plain characterized by a steep to very steep slope, about 40% to 60%, the relief often reaches an elevation of more that 600 meters especially the northerly and easterly portion.\n\nThe dominant topographic feature in the eastern margin of the town is the Vigan Gap Hill where the continuously shifting Vigan River cuts its way. The Gap Hill is located approximately 10 kilometers east of Vigan.\n\n===Weather and climate===\nThe city of Vigan falls under ([[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna]]), which is characterized by two pronounced seasons \u2013 the dry season which starts from the month of November and ends in April; and the wet season which spans the months of May to October. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|2506|mm|in|2}} and the heaviest registered rainfall is {{convert|6933|mm|in|2}}.\n\nThe average temperature is 26&nbsp;\u00b0C. The average warmest temperature is 30.9&nbsp;\u00b0C and the average coldest temperature is 21.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. An average of 7-10 typhoons visit Vigan annually. The average relative humidity is 81%.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Vigan (1981\u20132010, extremes 1903\u20132012)\n| single line = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| temperature colour = \n| Jan record high C = 35.6\n| Feb record high C = 35.3\n| Mar record high C = 36.9\n| Apr record high C = 38.8\n| May record high C = 38.2\n| Jun record high C = 38.2\n| Jul record high C = 35.4\n| Aug record high C = 36.9\n| Sep record high C = 35.1\n| Oct record high C = 39.3\n| Nov record high C = 36.7\n| Dec record high C = 35.5\n|year record high C = 39.3\n| Jan high C = 30.4\n| Feb high C = 30.9\n| Mar high C = 32.0\n| Apr high C = 33.3\n| May high C = 33.2\n| Jun high C = 32.0\n| Jul high C = 31.3\n| Aug high C = 30.6\n| Sep high C = 31.0\n| Oct high C = 31.5\n| Nov high C = 31.5\n| Dec high C = 30.8\n|year high C = 31.6\n| Jan mean C = 25.8\n| Feb mean C = 26.2\n| Mar mean C = 27.6\n| Apr mean C = 28.9\n| May mean C = 29.0\n| Jun mean C = 28.2\n| Jul mean C = 27.6\n| Aug mean C = 27.2\n| Sep mean C = 27.4\n| Oct mean C = 27.5\n| Nov mean C = 27.3\n| Dec mean C = 26.3\n|year mean C = 27.4\n| Jan low C = 21.1\n| Feb low C = 21.6\n| Mar low C = 23.1\n| Apr low C = 24.5\n| May low C = 24.8\n| Jun low C = 24.3\n| Jul low C = 23.9\n| Aug low C = 23.7\n| Sep low C = 23.7\n| Oct low C = 23.4\n| Nov low C = 23.0\n| Dec low C = 21.8\n|year low C = 23.3\n| Jan record low C = 13.5\n| Feb record low C = 14.0\n| Mar record low C = 16.0\n| Apr record low C = 19.5\n| May record low C = 19.6\n| Jun record low C = 16.8\n| Jul record low C = 17.8\n| Aug record low C = 17.0\n| Sep record low C = 19.0\n| Oct record low C = 17.2\n| Nov record low C = 15.4\n| Dec record low C = 14.5\n|year record low C = 13.5\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 3.5\n| Feb rain mm = 3.9\n| Mar rain mm = 5.4\n| Apr rain mm = 16.1\n| May rain mm = 194.5\n| Jun rain mm = 321.8\n| Jul rain mm = 536.3\n| Aug rain mm = 630.3\n| Sep rain mm = 382.6\n| Oct rain mm = 143.8\n| Nov rain mm = 36.3\n| Dec rain mm = 2.9\n|year rain mm = 2277.4\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 1\n| Feb rain days = 1\n| Mar rain days = 1\n| Apr rain days = 2\n| May rain days = 10\n| Jun rain days = 16\n| Jul rain days = 20\n| Aug rain days = 21\n| Sep rain days = 16\n| Oct rain days = 8\n| Nov rain days = 3\n| Dec rain days = 1\n|year rain days = 100\n| Jan humidity = 72\n| Feb humidity = 73\n| Mar humidity = 73\n| Apr humidity = 74\n| May humidity = 77\n| Jun humidity = 81\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 84\n| Sep humidity = 83\n| Oct humidity = 80\n| Nov humidity = 77\n| Dec humidity = 72\n|year humidity = 78\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181018220810/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalviganilocossur1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 18 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/dcb6cb4d-046b-4afb-9ceb-99f1f249bb7c\n| title = Vigan City, Ilocos Sur Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 18 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181018220852/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrviganilocossur.csv\n| archivedate = 18 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/5e4a56df-982f-4f1c-a39d-fbf274f51468\n| title = Vigan City, Ilocos Sur Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Vigan City\n| 1903 = 14945\n| 1918 = 17765\n| 1939 = 20939\n| 1948 = 21067\n| 1960 = 25990\n| 1970 = 30252\n| 1975 = 31971\n| 1980 = 33483\n| 1990 = 38574\n| 1995 = 42067\n| 2000 = 45143\n| 2007 = 47246\n| 2010 = 49747\n| 2015 = 53879\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Vigan was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2}}.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Horse carriages in Vigan City.JPG|thumb|[[Kalesa]], one of the modes of transportation in Vigan]]\n\n===Metro transport===\nModes of transport within the city are purely land-based. Vehicles for public use include [[jeepney]]s, [[tricycle]]s, vans-for-hire (or PUVs/public utility vehicles) and ''[[calesa]]''s (horse-drawn vehicles). Buses, mini-buses and jeepneys provide transportation to and from Vigan. The metro Vigan transport system is mostly served by tricycles, which are color- and number-coded to identify their municipality of origin.\n\n===Land transportation===\nVigan City is well-served by a network of roads and a major highway that connects to [[Manila North Road]], the highway leading to [[Manila]] and the rest of the country. Major bus companies such as [[Dominion Bus Lines]], [[Viron Transit]], [[Partas]], and [[Inocencio Aniceto Transportation|Aniceto/St. Joseph]] operate terminals in Vigan. [[GV Florida Transport|GMW Florida Transport]] operates a terminal in [[Bantay, Ilocos Sur|Bantay]], just outside Vigan.

The tank and a large bell-capital dating back to the 1st century BC can be seen on the nearby hill. Near the tomb, there are the remains of a medieval temple that survived as a pillared crypt. These are dedicated to Goddess Annapurna.

This is a developed, ornamental and decorated arched gate made of sandstone. On its both pillars Lord Vishnu's ten incarnations are engraved. Near it four carved and sculpted pillars and beams seems to be ruins of Trimurthy temple set on one raised platform, as Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Goddess Parvati and their servants are sculpted on these pillars and beams.\n\nHindola Torana with its two upright pillars and cross-beam has a truly indicative name. All the four sides of the two lofty pillars are carved into panels with insertion of the ten incarnations of Vishnu.
