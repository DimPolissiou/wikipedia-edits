Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nThe artist is also re-evaluating his own resources through his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

His studies also took him to the London School of Economics ([[Imre Lakatos]]), to Heidelberg University ([[Richard Rorty]]), IUC Dubrovnik ([[Michael Dummett]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]) and in 1976 to Berkeley where he studied with [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Mitterer received his doctorate at the [[University of Graz]] in 1978. He then worked as a Tour Director in Europe and Asia and as a Management Consultant for the Travel Industry in the USA. Since 1990 Mitterer has been teaching philosophy at the [[University of Klagenfurt]]<ref name=\"aau.at\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aau.at/team/mitterer-josef/|title=Visitenkarte Mitterer Josef}}</ref>; he held guest lectureships at the universities of Innsbruck, Linz, Ljubljana and Siegen. \n\nIn his book ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie'' (''The Beyond of Philosophy''), based on his dissertation, he developed a Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change, which foregoes the categorical distinction between language and language-distinct reality. In ''Die Flucht aus der Beliebigkeit'' (''The Flight from Contingency'') (2001) he critically examines the epistemological goal of truth. His critically acclaimed books have been translated into Polish and the [[A&HCI]]-Journal ''[[Constructivist Foundations]]'' has published two special issues on Mitterer's philosophy, ''The Non-dualizing Philosophy of Josef Mitterer'' (2008) and ''Non-dualism: A Conceptual Revision?'' (2013).\n\nJosef Mitterer is a member of the scientific advisory board of the [[European Forum Alpbach]]<ref>https://www.alpbach.org/en/about-us/who-we-are/programming/</ref>, of the board of the [[Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society]], of the advisory board of the [[Karl Popper]] Foundation and is one of the literary executors of [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]]. He was co-organizer of the 38th [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] \"Realism - Relativism - Constructivism\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alws.at/symposium/38th-international-wittgenstein-symposium/|title=38th International Wittgenstein Symposium 2015 \u2013 Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society}}</ref>\nIn 2018 Mitterer delivered the [[Heinz von Foerster]] Lecture at the University of Vienna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.univie.ac.at/zeitgeschichte/12-11-heinz-von-foerster-lecture-18-josef-mitterer-die-richtung-des-denkens/|title=Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte \u00bb 12.11. \u2013 Heinz von Foerster Lecture \u201918 \u2013 Josef Mitterer: Die Richtung des Denkens}}</ref>\n\n==Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change==\nThe Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change develops an alternative to three common features of reasoning which, according to Josef Mitterer, can be found in all major philosophical traditions. These three fundamental agreements are:\n\n*a dichotomic distinction between language and language-distinct reality, between descriptions and description-distinct objects, between talking about the world and the world itself, etc. - regardless of whether language depicts or constructs reality, whether the relationship between sign and referent is arbitrary or not.\n*the truth-orientation of philosophy. The search for truth and knowledge is a search for agreement between the two sides of this dichotomy: an agreement between language and reality, between description and object, between metalanguage and object language \u2013 regardless whether this agreement is called \"true\" or \"adequate\" with reference to an independent reality or if it is considered as viable in a constructed reality.\n*The direction of thinking is directed towards the objects of thought, whatever may serve as such an object: the world, reality, an element of an object-language. Our cognitive efforts are directed towards the objects of cognition.\nAccording to Mitterer these three commonalities are not only prevalent in realistic philosophies; they can also be found at least as residuals or minimal ontologies in postructuralist, relativist or (radical) constructivist theories of knowledge. He sums up the various philosophical traditions in a simple statement:\n\n''Either: There are distinctions and therefore we make them (realism) or: We make distinctions and therefore they are (idealism, constructivism).''<ref>cf. Josef Mitterer: Die Flucht aus der Beliebigkeit, \u00a7 11.</ref>\n\nIn ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie (The Beyond of Philosophy)'' Josef Mitterer developed an alternative way of thinking which foregoes the dichotomy between language and reality. A description of an object does not refer to the object, but rather starts from the object. The object of a description relates to the description of the object like a description ''so far'' to a description ''from now on''. A new description of the object changes the object into a new object of further description(s).\nMitterer does not want to deny or overcome the distinctions between language and reality, word and object, between what we talk and what we talk about. He is rather interested in when, how and why these distinctions are introduced into our discourse.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Primary===\n* ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie''.

His studies also took him to the London School of Economics ([[Imre Lakatos]]), to Heidelberg University ([[Richard Rorty]]), IUC Dubrovnik ([[Michael Dummett]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]) and in 1976 to Berkeley where he studied with [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Mitterer received his doctorate at the [[University of Graz]] in 1978. He then worked as a Tour Director in Europe and Asia and as a Management Consultant for the Travel Industry in the USA. Since 1990 Mitterer has been teaching philosophy at the [[University of Klagenfurt]]<ref name=\"aau.at\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aau.at/team/mitterer-josef/|title=Visitenkarte Mitterer Josef}}</ref>; he held guest lectureships at the universities of Innsbruck, Linz, Ljubljana and Siegen. \n\nIn his book ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie'' (''The Beyond of Philosophy''), based on his dissertation, he developed a Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change, which foregoes the categorical distinction between language and language-distinct reality. In ''Die Flucht aus der Beliebigkeit'' (''The Flight from Contingency'') (2001) he critically examines the epistemological goal of truth. His critically acclaimed books have been translated into Polish and the [[A&HCI]]-Journal ''[[Constructivist Foundations]]'' has published two special issues on Mitterer's philosophy, ''The Non-dualizing Philosophy of Josef Mitterer'' (2008) and ''Non-dualism: A Conceptual Revision?'' (2013).\n\nJosef Mitterer is a member of the scientific advisory board of the [[European Forum Alpbach]]<ref>https://www.alpbach.org/en/about-us/who-we-are/programming/</ref>, of the board of the [[Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society]], of the advisory board of the [[Karl Popper]] Foundation and is one of the literary executors of [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]]. He was co-organizer of the 38th [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] \"Realism - Relativism - Constructivism\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alws.at/symposium/38th-international-wittgenstein-symposium/|title=38th International Wittgenstein Symposium 2015 \u2013 Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society}}</ref>\nIn 2018 Mitterer delivered the [[Heinz von Foerster]] Lecture at the University of Vienna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.univie.ac.at/zeitgeschichte/12-11-heinz-von-foerster-lecture-18-josef-mitterer-die-richtung-des-denkens/|title=Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte \u00bb 12.11. \u2013 Heinz von Foerster Lecture \u201918 \u2013 Josef Mitterer: Die Richtung des Denkens}}</ref>\n\n==Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change==\nThe Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change develops an alternative to three common features of reasoning which, according to Josef Mitterer, can be found in all major philosophical traditions. These three fundamental agreements are:\n\n*a dichotomic distinction between language and language-distinct reality, between descriptions and description-distinct objects, between talking about the world and the world itself, etc. - regardless of whether language depicts or constructs reality, whether the relationship between sign and referent is arbitrary or not.\n*the truth-orientation of philosophy. The search for truth and knowledge is a search for agreement between the two sides of this dichotomy: an agreement between language and reality, between description and object, between metalanguage and object language \u2013 regardless whether this agreement is called \"true\" or \"adequate\" with reference to an independent reality or if it is considered as viable in a constructed reality.\n*The direction of thinking is directed towards the objects of thought, whatever may serve as such an object: the world, reality, an element of an object-language. Our cognitive efforts are directed towards the objects of cognition.\nAccording to Mitterer these three commonalities are not only prevalent in realistic philosophies; they can also be found at least as residuals or minimal ontologies in postructuralist, relativist or (radical) constructivist theories of knowledge. He sums up the various philosophical traditions in a simple statement:\n\n''Either: There are distinctions and therefore we make them (realism) or: We make distinctions and therefore they are (idealism, constructivism).''<ref>cf. Josef Mitterer: Die Flucht aus der Beliebigkeit, \u00a7 11.</ref>\n\nIn ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie (The Beyond of Philosophy)'' Josef Mitterer developed an alternative way of thinking which foregoes the dichotomy between between language and reality. A description of an object does not refer to the object, but rather starts from the object. The object of a description relates to the description of the object like a description ''so far'' to a description ''from now on''. A new description of the object changes the object into a new object of further description(s).\nMitterer does not want to deny or overcome the distinctions between language and reality, word and object, between what we talk and what we talk about. He is rather interested in when, how and why these distinctions are introduced into our discourse.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Primary===\n* ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie''.

In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur.

In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur.

Accessed 2 November 2006.</ref> such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, and street scenes. Such representations (also called '''genre works''', '''genre scenes''', or '''genre views''') may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term ''genre art'' specify the medium or type of visual work, as in ''genre painting'', ''genre prints'', ''genre photographs'', and so on.\n\nRather confusingly, the normal meaning of [[genre]], covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the [[romance novel]]), is also used in the [[visual arts]]. Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the [[painting of the Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]]\u2014the great periods of genre works\u2014may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as [[still-life]], [[marine painting]], [[architectural painting]], and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a [[hierarchy of genres]], with [[history painting]] at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.\n\nThe following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the [[decorative arts]], especially from the [[Rococo]] of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as [[porcelain]], furniture, [[wallpaper]], and textiles.\n\n==Genre painting==\n{{main|Genre painting}}\n[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]\n\n''Genre painting'', also called ''genre scene'' or ''petit genre'', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively\u2014thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person\u2014a member of his family, say\u2014as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait\u2014sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].  Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of \"low\" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: \"barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects\".<ref>Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''</ref>  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the ''[[Labours of the Months]]'' in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously [[Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].\n\n===To 1800===\n[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''[[Merry company|Merry Company]]'', by Dirck Hals]]\nThe [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of \"[[Mannerist]] inversion\" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving \"low\" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.\n[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|Interior with woman by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595\u20131622), with the same scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm|title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief.

Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities (\"kermesse\"), or soldiers in camp.\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]\n\nIn [[Italy]], a \"school\" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname \"Il Bamboccio\" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.\n\n[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.\n\nIn England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697\u20131764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people full of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732\u201333, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.\n\nSpain had a tradition predating [[The Book of Good Love]] of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life\u2014as well as the kitchen scenes known as [[bodegones]]\u2014were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Vel\u00e1zquez]] (1599\u20131660) and [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617\u201382). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746\u20131828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871)]]\n[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|Hunter's home, by Henry Voordecker, 1826]]\n[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]\n\nWith the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819\u201377) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings\u2014at the scale traditionally reserved for \"important\" subjects\u2014thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a \"minor\" category. [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] (1824\u20131904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815\u201391).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.\n\n[[William Powell Frith]] (1819\u20131909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hardy Family of Artists: Frederick Daniel, George, Heywood, James and their descendants|last=Hardy|first=Kimber|publisher=ACC Art Books|year=2016|isbn=978-185149-826-0|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk UK|pages=12\u201363}}</ref> [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744\u201396) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785\u20131841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Pavel Fedotov]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.\n\nIn Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808\u201385) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825\u201390) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term \"genre painting\" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.\n\nThe first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812\u201321. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]].

Such representations (also called '''genre works''', '''genre scenes''', or '''genre views''') may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term ''genre art'' specify the medium or type of visual work, as in ''genre painting'', ''genre prints'', ''genre photographs'', and so on.\n\nRather confusingly, the normal meaning of [[genre]], covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the [[romance novel]]), is also used in the [[visual arts]].  Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the [[painting of the Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]]\u2014the great periods of genre works\u2014may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as [[still-life]], [[marine painting]], [[architectural painting]] and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a [[hierarchy of genres]], with [[history painting]] at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.\n\nThe following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the [[decorative arts]], especially from the [[Rococo]] of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as [[porcelain]], furniture, [[wallpaper]] and textiles.\n\n==Genre painting==\n{{main|Genre painting}}\n[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]\n\n''Genre painting'', also called ''genre scene'' or ''petit genre'', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively\u2014thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person\u2014a member of his family, say\u2014as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait\u2014sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].  Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of \"low\" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: \"barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects\".<ref>Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''</ref>  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the ''[[Labours of the Months]]'' in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously [[Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].\n\n===To 1800===\n[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''[[Merry company|Merry Company]]'', by Dirck Hals]]\nThe [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.

[[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.\n[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|Interior with woman by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595\u20131622), with the same scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm|title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief.

At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life\u2014as well as the kitchen scenes known as [[bodegones]]\u2014were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Vel\u00e1zquez]] (1599\u20131660) and [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617\u201382).

The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938\u20132009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894\u20131978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.\n\n===Genre in other traditions===\n[[Japan]]ese [[ukiyo-e]] prints are rich in depictions of people at leisure and at work, as are [[Korean art|Korean]] paintings, particularly those created in the 18th century.\n\n===Gallery of Flemish genre paintings===\n<gallery>\nFile:Jan Sanders van Hemessen 002.jpg|[[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]], ''Brothel scene'', circa 1545-1550.\nFile:David Teniers (II) - Tavern Scene - WGA22082.jpg|[[David Teniers the Younger]], ''Tavern scene'', 1640.\nFile:Joos van Craesbeeck - Soldiers and Women.jpg|[[Joos van Craesbeeck]], ''Soldiers and Women'', 1640s\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Gallery of Dutch 17th-century genre paintings===\n<gallery>\nFile:Hendrick_Avercamp_-_Winterlandschap_met_ijsvermaak.jpg|[[Hendrick Avercamp]] painted almost exclusively winter scenes of crowds.\nFile:Honthorst, Gerard van - Merry Company - 1623.jpg|[[Gerard van Honthorst]], ''Merry Company'', 1623, with the [[chiaroscuro]] composition often used by the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]].\nFile:Judith Leyster A Boy and a Girl with a Cat and an Eel.jpg|[[Judith Leyster]], ''A Boy and a Girl with a Cat and an Eel'', ca. 1635\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Genre photography==\n[[Image:Felice Beato Shamisen.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|''Woman playing a [[shamisen]]'', 1860s, hand-coloured albumen silver print by [[Felice Beato]]]]\n\nWhile genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.\n\nAlthough the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as [[anthropology]] and the [[behavioural sciences]].\n\nThe development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as [[street photography]].<ref>''Bystander: A History of Street Photography'' by [[Joel Meyerowitz]] and [[Colin Westerbeck]], Boston: [[Bulfinch Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-82121-755-0}}.
