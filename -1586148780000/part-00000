George Feltenstein, film historian and senior vice president of theatrical catalog marketing at [[Warner Home Video]], states, \"Women screaming in terror has been a Hollywood mainstay \u2014 even when films were silent\".<ref name=\"USA\"/>  One of the first scream queens in the talkies was [[Fay Wray]], as her character in ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933) spent a good part of her interactions with the ape shrieking in terror. [[Barbara Steele]], who is best remembered as [[Mario Bava]]'s muse in the Italian [[gothic horror]] masterpiece, ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'' (1960), can also be considered as one of the greatest scream queens in horror history due to her constant appearances as the female protagonist in Italian horror films.

Engineering technology education is even more applied and less theoretical than [[engineering education]], though in a broad sense both have a focus on practical application. Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design (including improvement), fabrication and testing. Also as with engineers, engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"engineering technologist\" or \"technologist\" is viewed by the Engineering Technology Council (ETC) of the American Society of Engineering Educators (ASEE) as a derogatory and demeaning term. It is suggested that the term \"Engineering Technology Graduate\" or simply \"ET Graduate\" be used to refer to these highly qualified individuals. The term \"technologist\" has been used by some to insinuate that the more applied and practice focused, less mathematically rigorous ETAC/ABET Baccalaureate Programs in Engineering Technology produce graduates who are not engineers. In fact, much data has shown that a high percentage of ETAC/ABET accredited baccalaureate Engineering Technology graduates are employed immediately upon graduation as engineers in industry. In addition, the term has been used to exclude qualified ET graduates from sitting for exams that would lead to registration as a Professional Engineer.\n\nA 2017 Report by the National Academy of Engineering explored Engineering Technology in the United States. Unfortunately, it chose to use the term \"technologist\" throughout its text. Nonetheless, it remains one of the best sources for authoritative information about Engineering Technology.<ref>National Academy of Engineering. 2017. Engineering Technology Education in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/23402.</ref>\n\nTypically, engineering technology courses have more labs associated with their undergraduate courses that require hands-on application of the studied topics. The focus of the programs is towards the practical application of engineering principles and theory. ET faculty are required to have some level of industrial experience. In addition, Engineering technology programs have a higher percentage of faculty who are Professional Engineers than engineering programs. \n\nStudents in ET Programs are more likely to come from very urban or very rural areas. ET programs have at least twice the percentage of African-American students when compared to traditional engineering programs.<ref>National Academy of Engineering. 2017. Engineering Technology Education in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/23402.</ref> \n\nThere is generally no distinction made between engineer and engineering technology graduates when it comes to hiring by most companies in industry, Graduates of engineering technology programs are normally recruited equally as engineering graduates. In some cases, preference is giving to those with applied engineering knowledge. Some positions may be better suited for engineering degree graduates whereas others are much more suited for engineering technology graduates. This largely depends on the employer, employer needs and type of company. Whether the degree is called engineering, engineering technology or applied engineering, there is a need in industry for each type of graduate.         \n\n==Professional Engineering Licensure==\nAlthough a minority of states (mostly in the South and Midwest) require a BS degree in engineering accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of [[Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) with no exceptions for professional engineering licensure, about two thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET to become licensed as [[professional engineer]]s. Each state has different requirements on years of experience to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. Engineering technology graduates with applied engineering skills often gain further learning in graduate school with an MS degree in engineering technology, engineering, engineering management, construction management or an NAAB-accredited master of architecture degree program. These degrees are now offered online or through distant learning opportunities with various universities, both nationally and internationally, allowing an individual to continue working full time while gaining an advance degree.\n\nThe Board of the American Association of Engineering Educators (ASEE) unanimously passed a position statement in early 2020 calling for all states to allow, without additional requirements, ETAC/ABET Baccalaureate Engineering Technology graduates to become Registered Professional Engineers. <ref>https://www.asee.org/documents/about-us/the-organization/public-policy/ASEE_proposed_position_statement_BS_ET_and_PEs_2020.pdf</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, a historic tie vote at the annual meeting of the National Council of Examiners in Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) narrowly defeated a motion that would have established model laws and rules establishing a recommended pathway for professional licensure for all ETAC/ABET accredited baccalaureate ET graduates in all states and territories. Opposition to the motion was led by Dennis Truax from Mississippi and was supported primarily by individuals from states in the South and Midwest. \n\nIt has been claimed by some that limits on engineering technology graduates obtaining professional engineering registration in the states of Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and South Carolina may be linked to the fact that ET programs were more often found at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Engineering programs were more often found at predominantly white campuses. Current limits on professional licensure in those states may be viewed as a remnant of the Segregationist South.\n\n== Nature of work ==\nEngineering technology graduates are employed in a wide array of industries and areas \u2013 including engineering, product development, manufacturing, technology operation, maintenance, architecture and construction. They may be managers, depending on the experience and educational emphasis on management. Entry-level positions relating in various ways to [[product design]], [[product testing]], [[product development]], [[systems development]], field engineering, technical operations and [[quality control]] are common for engineering technology graduates.\n\nEngineering Technology graduates also become members of the [[United States Merchant Marines]] as civilian mariners. They generally start by obtaining a [[Merchant Mariner Credential]] issued by the United States Coast Guard. They are licensed as National 3rd Assistant Engineer of Steam/Motor/Gas Turbine. The license can be obtained by graduates of mechanical or electrical engineering course of an ABET accredited school of technology, with 180 days service in the engine room of steam, motor or gas turbine vessels. With years of experience they gain additional and higher rankings. There is no distinction made between engineering or engineering technology degrees which is consistent with most jobs in industry - the degree is engineering technology, the career is engineering.\n\nIn 2012, The Journal of Engineering Technology, published results that show \"that a very broad range of engineering companies operating across the full spectrum of engineering services and products, baccalaureate engineering technology graduates are operating as engineers. Moreover, these graduates function in many engineering roles equally as well as their contemporaries from engineering.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Engineering Technologists Are Engineers|url=http://www.engtech.org/docs/Jet_Article_re_Survey.pdf|work=Ronald E.

The focus on applied study addressed a need within the scientific, manufacturing and engineering communities, as well as other industries, for professionals with hands-on and applications-based engineering knowledge. Depending on the institution, [[associate's degree|associate's]] and/or [[bachelor's degrees]] are offered, with some institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]] in technology.\n\nIn general, an engineering technology graduate receives a broad range of [[applied science]] and [[applied mathematics]] training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student's area of focus. Engineering technology programs typically include instruction in various engineering support functions for research, production and operations and applications to specific engineering specialties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright, Jr. |first=John |title=Venn Diagram Definitions |url=http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=48 |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-11-13 }}</ref> [[Information technology]] is primarily involved with the management, operation and maintenance of computer systems and networks, along with an application of technology in diverse fields such as [[architecture]], engineering, [[graphic design]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]] and [[network security]]. An engineering technology graduate is also expected to have had some coursework in [[ethics]].\n\nInternational technology organizations from eight nations have signed a mutual recognition agreement called the [[Sydney Accord]], which represents an understanding that the academic awards of engineering technology graduates can be recognized in all signatory states. The Sydney Accord is viewed as somewhat controversial in the United States because of the vast difference in the robust ETAC/ABET accredited BS Engineering Technology programs offered here versus other locations around the globe. In addition, the Accord uses the offensive term \"technologist\" throughout its content.\n\nEngineering Technology graduates acquiring an associate degree or lower typically find careers as engineering technicians. According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]: \"Many four-year colleges offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology and graduates of these programs are hired to work as entry-level electrical or electronics engineers or applied engineers, but not technicians.\"<ref>{{Cite web | title = Engineering Technicians\n  | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition\n  | publisher = Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor\n  | date = December 17, 2009\n  | url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4\n  | accessdate = 2012-11-15 }}</ref> Engineering technicians typically hold a two-year associate degree, while engineering technology graduates likewise hold a bachelor's degrees.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the regulated title for technologists is Certified Engineering Technologist. Technology program accreditation is administered through CTAB, often in conjunction with provincial associations affiliated with the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists. Graduated technologists are certified by their provincial bodies.\n\nThe new occupational category of \"technologist\" was established in the 1960s in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and [[technical institute]]s. It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering degrees and the predominantly practical approach of [[technician]] and trades programs. Provincial associations may certify individuals as a [[Professional Technologist]] (P.Tech.), [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (C.E.T.), [[Registered Engineering Technologist]] (R.E.T.), [[Applied Science Technologist]] (AScT) or Technologue Professionel [T.P.]. These provincial associations are constituent members of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT), which nationally accredits technology programs across Canada through its [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB). Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on the province, often containing as many classroom hours as a 4-year degree program.\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the hierarchy of educational structure and acknowledgement start at the [[U.S. Department of Education]] or the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). The U.S. Department of Education acknowledges regional and national [[Educational accreditation|accreditations]] and CHEA recognizes specialty accreditations. Two technology accreditations are currently recognized by CHEA: The [[Association of Technology, Management and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE) and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Specifically, CHEA recognizes ABET internationally and in the U.S. for accrediting engineering technology programs at the associate and baccalaureate level. CHEA also recognizes ATMAE for accrediting associate, baccalaureate and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States. (2011).<ref>[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=December 31, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nABET has been accrediting engineering technology programs in the United States since 1946, with a total of over 600 programs at more than 230 institutions. In response to heavy demand, ABET began accrediting engineering technology programs internationally in 2007. Depending on the institution, associate's and/or bachelor's degrees are offered, with a few institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]]. The type, length and quality of education offered can vary greatly depending on the educational institution and the specialty pursued within engineering technology. ATMAE-accredited engineering technology programs require a management core.\n\nThe ETAC of ABET was admitted as a provisional member of International Technology Accords in 2007 and it signed the Sydney Accord in 2009.\n\nOther [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] and CHEA-recognized accrediting agencies in the U.S.\u2014(such as the [[Distance Education and Training Council]] (DETC) Accrediting Council and the [[Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools]] (ACICS)\u2014accredit colleges and universities with programs leading to bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies.\n\nThe [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET) awards certification at two levels depending on work experience: the Associate Engineering Technologist (AT) and the Certified Engineering Technologist (CT) - however NICET has said that it was never created to certify ETAC/ABET Baccalaureate graduates. Groups have suggested that NICET change the title of their certifications to remove \"technologist\" to avoid confusion and avoid discriminatory language. ATMAE awards two levels of certification in technology management: Certified Technology Manager (CTM) and Certified Senior Technology Manager (CSTM). ATMAE also awards two levels of certification in manufacturing specialist: Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) and Certified Senior Manufacturing Specialist (CSMS). While the CTM and CMS certification are obtained through examination, the CSTM and CSMS require industry experience and continuous improvement via the obtainment of professional development units (PDUs).\n\nAmerican Society of Certified Engineering Technicians (ASCET) is a membership organization that welcomes engineering technicians and engineers as members.\n\nThe publication of the US Department of Education and the National Science Foundation known as Mapping The World of Education indicates that an engineering technology degree is at the same academic level (60) as an ABET/EAC engineering degree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | title=Mapping the World of Education: The Comparative Database System (CDS) | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062653/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | archivedate=2007-04-30}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system of learning. UK engineering technologists have always been designated as \"engineers\". The term \"engineer\" in the UK is used to describe the entire range of skilled worker and professionals from trades people through to the highly educated Chartered Engineer. In fact up until the 1960s professional engineers in the UK were often referred to as \"Technologists\" to distinguish them from scientists, technicians and craftsmen. The modern term for an engineering technologist is \"incorporated engineer\" (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a bachelors or honours degree in engineering. Modern technical apprenticeships would normally lead to the [[EngTech]] professional qualification and with further studies at higher apprenticeship level an [[IEng]]. Since 2015 the UK government ([[UCAS]]) has introduced engineering degree (bachelors and masters) apprenticeships. The title \"incorporated engineer\" is protected by civil law. Prior to the title \"incorporated engineer\", U.K. technologists were known as \"technician engineers\" a designation introduced in the 1960s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, an incorporated engineer is accepted as a \"professional engineer\", registered by the EngC, although the term \"professional engineer\" has no legal meaning in the U.K. and there are no restrictions on practice. In fact anyone in the U.K. can call themselves an \"engineer\" or \"professional engineer\" without any qualifications or proven competencies in engineering and most U.K. skilled trades are sometimes referred to as \"professional\" or \"accredited\" engineers. Examples are \"Registered Gas Engineer\" (gas installer) or \"Professional Telephone Engineer\" (phone line installer or fault diagnosis).\n\nIncorporated engineers are recognized internationally through the Sydney Accord academic agreement as engineering technologists.<ref>\n{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = S.E. | date = June 1996 | title = Mapping The World of Education: The Comparative Database System | volume = 2 | pages = 365\u2013372 | publisher = [[National Science Foundation]] | accessdate = 23 October 2005 | url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | chapter = (GB) United Kingdom | chapterurl = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/pdf/degu.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101016044336/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | archivedate = 16 October 2010 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050018.htm | title = The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (First General System) Regulations 2005 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/20072781.htm | title = The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}</ref>\nOne of the professional titles for engineers in the United Kingdom, recognized in the Washington Accord is the chartered engineer.

As a result, the chartered and incorporated engineer are placed under the same directive, 2005/36/EC. The incorporated engineer can practice autonomously without the oversight of a chartered engineer.\n\nIncorporated engineers currently require an IEng accredited bachelors or honours degree in engineering (prior to 1997 the B.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees satisfied the academic requirements for \"chartered engineer\" registration), a [[Higher National Certificate]] or diploma, [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] higher diploma/full technological cert diploma or a [[Foundation Degree]] in engineering, plus appropriate further learning to degree level or an NVQ4 or SVQ4 approved for the purpose by a licensed engineering institution.\n\nThe academic requirements must be accompanied by the appropriate peer reviewed experience in employment-typical 4 years post qualification. In addition to the experience and academic requirements, the engineering candidate must have three referees (themselves CEng or IEng) that vouch for the performance of the individual being considered for professional recognition. There are a number of alternative ways to achieve IEng status for those that do not have the necessary qualifications for applicants, that can clearly show they have achieved the same level as those with qualifications, including:\n\n* writing a technical report, based upon their experience and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of engineering principles;\n* earning the City and Guilds graduate diploma (bachelors level) and post graduate diploma (masters level) accredited by [[IMechE]], [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] and [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]\n* following a work-based learning program; or \n* taking an academic program specified by the institution to which they are applying.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.shu.ac.uk/engineering/types-incorporated.html |title = NotFound &#124; Sheffield Hallam University}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany \u2013 European Union ===\n\n====Engineering Technologist/State-certified Engineer====\nThe title 'state-certified engineer BVT' is awarded to qualified engineering technologists<ref>{{Cite web|title = Der Techniker Englisch {{!}} VdT|url = http://www.v-dt.de/content/der-techniker-englisch|website = www.v-dt.de|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref> (staatlich gepruefter Techniker) by the Bundesverband h\u00f6herer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V.

Furthermore, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principal permits entry into any undergraduate academic degree program. The engineering technologist/state-certified engineer should not be confused with academically qualified engineers, which previously graduated from universities as Diplom-Ingenieur (Diploma in Engineering) and following the Bologna process with BEng + MEng degrees.\n\n====State-certified technicians/engineers in the EU directives====\nAs of January 31, 2012, state certified engineers, state certified business managers and state certified designers are at level 6-bachelor on the DQF and EQF. The qualifications more than a decade ago were entered into [[Directive (European Union)|EU Directives]] as recognized regulated professions in Germany and the EU. Annexes C and D were added to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC.\n\nTop institutions involved included the federal government (the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]]), EU Standing Conference and Economic Ministerial Meeting of Countries, the German Confederation of Hand-plant, the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]], German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, [[Confederation of German Trade Unions]] and Federal Institute for Vocational Application. These government institutions agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF and a German qualifications framework (DQR).\n\nEuropean Union law and other documents considered to be public include:\n\n* Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu//en/index.htm |title = EU law \u2013 EUR-Lex}}</ref>\n* EU Directive 2005L0036-EN 01.01.2007\n* ANNEX III list of regulated education and training referred to in the third sub paragraph of Article 13(2)<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130929234628/http://www.scribd.com/doc/53286830/Directive-2005-36-EC</ref>\n\nThe qualifications framework requires: \"regulated courses for the professions of state-certified ('staatlich gepruefte(r)') technician/engineer ('Techniker(in)'), business economist (business manager), ('Betriebswirt(in)'), designer ('Gestalter(in)') and family assistant ('Familiepfleger(in)'), of a total duration not less than 16 years, a prerequisite of which is successful completion of compulsory schooling or equivalent education and training (of a duration of not less than nine years) and successful completion of a course at a trade school ('Berufsschule') of a duration of not less than three years and comprising, upon completion of at least two years of work experience, full-time education and training of a duration of not less than two years or part-time education and training of equivalent duration.\"\n\n===International engineering technologist (IntET)===\nThe international engineering technologist (IntET) qualification was launched in late 2007 by ETMF, which is part of the International Engineering Alliance (IEA). The qualification is awarded by each member jurisdiction followed by a jurisdictional identifier, such as IntET (UK) for the U.K.\n\nIn addition to the benefits gained through IEng professional qualification (an eligibility requirement), IntET (UK) offers additional benefits, including letters after name (such as \"J. Smith IEng IntET (UK)\") and easier admission to National Registers of IntET register member jurisdictions. The EngC and its fellow ETMF members are pursuing the possibility of future mutual recognition of professional titles, which would further enhance the benefits of IntET qualification.\n\nThe IntET (UK) qualification is open to U.K.-registered incorporated engineers who have met the requirements: seven years post-graduate experience, two years responsibility of significant engineering work and maintaining continuing professional development. Incorporated engineers who do not hold an accredited degree recognised under the Sydney Accord or equivalent academic qualification, are currently not eligible to apply for IntET (UK) qualification.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Technology and applied sciences}}\n*[[Drafter]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n*{{Cite journal\n|last=Sastry\n|first=M.K.S.\n|author2=Clement K.

Engineering technology education is even more applied and less theoretical than [[engineering education]], though in a broad sense both have a focus on practical application. Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design (including improvement), fabrication and testing. Also as with engineers, engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"engineering technologist\" or \"technologist\" is viewed by the Engineering Technology Council (ETC) of the American Society of Engineering Educators (ASEE) as a derogatory and demeaning term. It is suggested that the term \"Engineering Technology Graduate\" or simply \"ET Graduate\" be used to refer to these highly qualified individuals. The term \"technologist\" has been used by some to insinuate that the more applied and practice focused, less mathematically rigorous ETAC/ABET Baccalaureate Programs in Engineering Technology produce graduates who are not engineers. In fact, much data has shown that a high percentage of ETAC/ABET accredited baccalaureate Engineering Technology graduates are employed immediately upon graduation as engineers in industry. In addition, the term has been used to exclude qualified ET graduates from sitting for exams that would lead to registration as a Professional Engineer.\n\nA 2017 Report by the National Academy of Engineering explored Engineering Technology in the United States. Unfortunately, it chose to use the term \"technologist\" throughout its text. Nonetheless, it remains one of the best sources for authoritative information about Engineering Technology.<ref>National Academy of Engineering. 2017. Engineering Technology Education in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/23402.</ref>\n\nTypically, engineering technology courses have more labs associated with their undergraduate courses that require hands-on application of the studied topics. The focus of the programs is towards the practical application of engineering principles and theory. ET faculty are required to have some level of industrial experience. In addition, Engineering technology programs have a higher percentage of faculty who are Professional Engineers than engineering programs. \n\nStudents in ET Programs are more likely to come from very urban or very rural areas. ET programs have at least twice the percentage of African-American students when compared to traditional engineering programs.<ref>National Academy of Engineering. 2017. Engineering Technology Education in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/23402.</ref> \n\nThere is generally no distinction made between engineer and engineering technology graduates when it comes to hiring by most companies in industry, Graduates of engineering technology programs are normally recruited equally as engineering graduates. In some cases, preference is giving to those with applied engineering knowledge. Some positions may be better suited for engineering degree graduates whereas others are much more suited for engineering technology graduates. This largely depends on the employer, employer needs and type of company. Whether the degree is called engineering, engineering technology or applied engineering, there is a need in industry for each type of graduate.         \n\n==Professional Engineering Licensure==\nAlthough a minority of states (mostly in the South and Midwest) require a BS degree in engineering accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of [[Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) with no exceptions for professional engineering licensure, about two thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET to become licensed as [[professional engineer]]s.

Entry-level positions relating in various ways to [[product design]], [[product testing]], [[product development]], [[systems development]], field engineering, technical operations and [[quality control]] are common for engineering technology graduates.\n\nEngineering Technology graduates also become members of the [[United States Merchant Marines]] as civilian mariners. They generally start by obtaining a [[Merchant Mariner Credential]] issued by the United States Coast Guard. They are licensed as National 3rd Assistant Engineer of Steam/Motor/Gas Turbine. The license can be obtained by graduates of mechanical or electrical engineering course of an ABET accredited school of technology, with 180 days service in the engine room of steam, motor or gas turbine vessels. With years of experience they gain additional and higher rankings. There is no distinction made between engineering or engineering technology degrees which is consistent with most jobs in industry - the degree is engineering technology, the career is engineering.\n\nIn 2012, The Journal of Engineering Technology, published results that show \"that a very broad range of engineering companies operating across the full spectrum of engineering services and products, baccalaureate engineering technology graduates are operating as engineers. Moreover, these graduates function in many engineering roles equally as well as their contemporaries from engineering.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Engineering Technologists Are Engineers|url=http://www.engtech.org/docs/Jet_Article_re_Survey.pdf|work=Ronald E.

The focus on applied study addressed a need within the scientific, manufacturing and engineering communities, as well as other industries, for professionals with hands-on and applications-based engineering knowledge. Depending on the institution, [[associate's degree|associate's]] and/or [[bachelor's degrees]] are offered, with some institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]] in technology.\n\nIn general, an engineering technology graduate receives a broad range of [[applied science]] and [[applied mathematics]] training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student's area of focus. Engineering technology programs typically include instruction in various engineering support functions for research, production and operations and applications to specific engineering specialties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright, Jr. |first=John |title=Venn Diagram Definitions |url=http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=48 |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-11-13 }}</ref> [[Information technology]] is primarily involved with the management, operation and maintenance of computer systems and networks, along with an application of technology in diverse fields such as [[architecture]], engineering, [[graphic design]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]] and [[network security]]. An engineering technology graduate is also expected to have had some coursework in [[ethics]].\n\nInternational technology organizations from eight nations have signed a mutual recognition agreement called the [[Sydney Accord]], which represents an understanding that the academic awards of engineering technology graduates can be recognized in all signatory states. The Sydney Accord is viewed as somewhat controversial in the United States because of the vast difference in the robust ETAC/ABET accredited BS Engineering Technology programs offered here versus other locations around the globe. In addition, the Accord uses the offensive term \"technologist\" throughout its content.\n\nEngineering Technology graduates acquiring an associate degree or lower typically find careers as engineering technicians. According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]: \"Many four-year colleges offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology and graduates of these programs are hired to work as entry-level electrical or electronics engineers or applied engineers, but not technicians.\"<ref>{{Cite web | title = Engineering Technicians\n  | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition\n  | publisher = Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor\n  | date = December 17, 2009\n  | url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4\n  | accessdate = 2012-11-15 }}</ref> Engineering technicians typically hold a two-year associate degree, while engineering technology graduates likewise hold a bachelor's degrees.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the regulated title for technologists is Certified Engineering Technologist. Technology program accreditation is administered through CTAB, often in conjunction with provincial associations affiliated with the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists. Graduated technologists are certified by their provincial bodies.\n\nThe new occupational category of \"technologist\" was established in the 1960s in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and [[technical institute]]s. It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering degrees and the predominantly practical approach of [[technician]] and trades programs. Provincial associations may certify individuals as a [[Professional Technologist]] (P.Tech.), [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (C.E.T.), [[Registered Engineering Technologist]] (R.E.T.), [[Applied Science Technologist]] (AScT) or Technologue Professionel [T.P.]. These provincial associations are constituent members of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT), which nationally accredits technology programs across Canada through its [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB). Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on the province, often containing as many classroom hours as a 4-year degree program.\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the hierarchy of educational structure and acknowledgement start at the [[U.S. Department of Education]] or the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). The U.S. Department of Education acknowledges regional and national [[Educational accreditation|accreditations]] and CHEA recognizes specialty accreditations. Two technology accreditations are currently recognized by CHEA: The [[Association of Technology, Management and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE) and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Specifically, CHEA recognizes ABET internationally and in the U.S. for accrediting engineering technology programs at the associate and baccalaureate level. CHEA also recognizes ATMAE for accrediting associate, baccalaureate and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States. (2011).<ref>[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=December 31, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nABET has been accrediting engineering technology programs in the United States since 1946, with a total of over 600 programs at more than 230 institutions. In response to heavy demand, ABET began accrediting engineering technology programs internationally in 2007. Depending on the institution, associate's and/or bachelor's degrees are offered, with a few institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]]. The type, length and quality of education offered can vary greatly depending on the educational institution and the specialty pursued within engineering technology. ATMAE-accredited engineering technology programs require a management core.\n\nThe ETAC of ABET was admitted as a provisional member of International Technology Accords in 2007 and it signed the Sydney Accord in 2009.\n\nOther [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] and CHEA-recognized accrediting agencies in the U.S.\u2014(such as the [[Distance Education and Training Council]] (DETC) Accrediting Council and the [[Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools]] (ACICS)\u2014accredit colleges and universities with programs leading to bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies.\n\nThe [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET) awards certification at two levels depending on work experience: the Associate Engineering Technologist (AT) and the Certified Engineering Technologist (CT) - however NICET has said that it was never created to certify ETAC/ABET Baccalaureate graduates. Groups have suggested that NICET change the title of their certifications to remove \"technologist\" to avoid confusion and avoid discriminatory langauge. ATMAE awards two levels of certification in technology management: Certified Technology Manager (CTM) and Certified Senior Technology Manager (CSTM). ATMAE also awards two levels of certification in manufacturing specialist: Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) and Certified Senior Manufacturing Specialist (CSMS). While the CTM and CMS certification are obtained through examination, the CSTM and CSMS require industry experience and continuous improvement via the obtainment of professional development units (PDUs).\n\nAmerican Society of Certified Engineering Technicians (ASCET) is a membership organization that welcomes engineering technicians and engineers as members.\n\nThe publication of the US Department of Education and the National Science Foundation known as Mapping The World of Education indicates that an engineering technology degree is at the same academic level (60) as an ABET/EAC engineering degree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | title=Mapping the World of Education: The Comparative Database System (CDS) | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062653/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | archivedate=2007-04-30}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system of learning. UK engineering technologists have always been designated as \"engineers\". The term \"engineer\" in the UK is used to describe the entire range of skilled worker and professionals from trades people through to the highly educated Chartered Engineer. In fact up until the 1960s professional engineers in the UK were often referred to as \"Technologists\" to distinguish them from scientists, technicians and craftsmen. The modern term for an engineering technologist is \"incorporated engineer\" (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a bachelors or honours degree in engineering. Modern technical apprenticeships would normally lead to the [[EngTech]] professional qualification and with further studies at higher apprenticeship level an [[IEng]]. Since 2015 the UK government ([[UCAS]]) has introduced engineering degree (bachelors and masters) apprenticeships. The title \"incorporated engineer\" is protected by civil law. Prior to the title \"incorporated engineer\", U.K. technologists were known as \"technician engineers\" a designation introduced in the 1960s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, an incorporated engineer is accepted as a \"professional engineer\", registered by the EngC, although the term \"professional engineer\" has no legal meaning in the U.K. and there are no restrictions on practice. In fact anyone in the U.K. can call themselves an \"engineer\" or \"professional engineer\" without any qualifications or proven competencies in engineering and most U.K. skilled trades are sometimes referred to as \"professional\" or \"accredited\" engineers. Examples are \"Registered Gas Engineer\" (gas installer) or \"Professional Telephone Engineer\" (phone line installer or fault diagnosis).\n\nIncorporated engineers are recognized internationally through the Sydney Accord academic agreement as engineering technologists.<ref>\n{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = S.E. | date = June 1996 | title = Mapping The World of Education: The Comparative Database System | volume = 2 | pages = 365\u2013372 | publisher = [[National Science Foundation]] | accessdate = 23 October 2005 | url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | chapter = (GB) United Kingdom | chapterurl = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/pdf/degu.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101016044336/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | archivedate = 16 October 2010 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050018.htm | title = The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (First General System) Regulations 2005 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/20072781.htm | title = The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}</ref>\nOne of the professional titles for engineers in the United Kingdom, recognized in the Washington Accord is the chartered engineer.

As a result, the chartered and incorporated engineer are placed under the same directive, 2005/36/EC. The incorporated engineer can practice autonomously without the oversight of a chartered engineer.\n\nIncorporated engineers currently require an IEng accredited bachelors or honours degree in engineering (prior to 1997 the B.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees satisfied the academic requirements for \"chartered engineer\" registration), a [[Higher National Certificate]] or diploma, [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] higher diploma/full technological cert diploma or a [[Foundation Degree]] in engineering, plus appropriate further learning to degree level or an NVQ4 or SVQ4 approved for the purpose by a licensed engineering institution.\n\nThe academic requirements must be accompanied by the appropriate peer reviewed experience in employment-typical 4 years post qualification. In addition to the experience and academic requirements, the engineering candidate must have three referees (themselves CEng or IEng) that vouch for the performance of the individual being considered for professional recognition. There are a number of alternative ways to achieve IEng status for those that do not have the necessary qualifications for applicants, that can clearly show they have achieved the same level as those with qualifications, including:\n\n* writing a technical report, based upon their experience and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of engineering principles;\n* earning the City and Guilds graduate diploma (bachelors level) and post graduate diploma (masters level) accredited by [[IMechE]], [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] and [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]\n* following a work-based learning program; or \n* taking an academic program specified by the institution to which they are applying.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.shu.ac.uk/engineering/types-incorporated.html |title = NotFound &#124; Sheffield Hallam University}}</ref>\n\n=== Germany \u2013 European Union ===\n\n====Engineering Technologist/State-certified Engineer====\nThe title 'state-certified engineer BVT' is awarded to qualified engineering technologists<ref>{{Cite web|title = Der Techniker Englisch {{!}} VdT|url = http://www.v-dt.de/content/der-techniker-englisch|website = www.v-dt.de|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref> (staatlich gepruefter Techniker) by the Bundesverband h\u00f6herer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V.

To be eligible for the engineering technologist examination, candidates must fulfill the following requirements: completion of one of the school systems ([[Hauptschule]], [[Realschule]], [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]), an apprenticeship of at least two years duration, one year of completed professional work experience and attendance of a taught program with a course load of 2400\u20133000 hours, usually completed within two years in full-time or 3.5 \u2013 4 years part-time at vocational colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Staatlich gepr\u00fcfter Techniker \u203a Fernstudium & Weiterbildung|url = http://www.staatlich-gepruefter-techniker.com/|website = www.staatlich-gepruefter-techniker.com|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAs of January 2012, the state-certified engineer/engineering technologist was allocated to level 6 of the [[European Qualifications Framework]], equivalent to undergraduate degrees (bachelor's level). Furthermore, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principal permits entry into any undergraduate academic degree program. The engineering technologist/state-certified engineer should not be confused with academically qualified engineers, which previously graduated from universities as Diplom-Ingenieur (Diploma in Engineering) and following the Bologna process with BEng + MEng degrees.\n\n====State-certified technicians/engineers in the EU directives====\nAs of January 31, 2012, state certified engineers, state certified business managers and state certified designers are at level 6-bachelor on the DQF and EQF. The qualifications more than a decade ago were entered into [[Directive (European Union)|EU Directives]] as recognized regulated professions in Germany and the EU. Annexes C and D were added to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC.\n\nTop institutions involved included the federal government (the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]]), EU Standing Conference and Economic Ministerial Meeting of Countries, the German Confederation of Hand-plant, the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]], German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, [[Confederation of German Trade Unions]] and Federal Institute for Vocational Application. These government institutions agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF and a German qualifications framework (DQR).\n\nEuropean Union law and other documents considered to be public include:\n\n* Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu//en/index.htm |title = EU law \u2013 EUR-Lex}}</ref>\n* EU Directive 2005L0036-EN 01.01.2007\n* ANNEX III list of regulated education and training referred to in the third sub paragraph of Article 13(2)<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130929234628/http://www.scribd.com/doc/53286830/Directive-2005-36-EC</ref>\n\nThe qualifications framework requires: \"regulated courses for the professions of state-certified ('staatlich gepruefte(r)') technician/engineer ('Techniker(in)'), business economist (business manager), ('Betriebswirt(in)'), designer ('Gestalter(in)') and family assistant ('Familiepfleger(in)'), of a total duration not less than 16 years, a prerequisite of which is successful completion of compulsory schooling or equivalent education and training (of a duration of not less than nine years) and successful completion of a course at a trade school ('Berufsschule') of a duration of not less than three years and comprising, upon completion of at least two years of work experience, full-time education and training of a duration of not less than two years or part-time education and training of equivalent duration.\"\n\n===International engineering technologist (IntET)===\nThe international engineering technologist (IntET) qualification was launched in late 2007 by ETMF, which is part of the International Engineering Alliance (IEA). The qualification is awarded by each member jurisdiction followed by a jurisdictional identifier, such as IntET (UK) for the U.K.\n\nIn addition to the benefits gained through IEng professional qualification (an eligibility requirement), IntET (UK) offers additional benefits, including letters after name (such as \"J. Smith IEng IntET (UK)\") and easier admission to National Registers of IntET register member jurisdictions. The EngC and its fellow ETMF members are pursuing the possibility of future mutual recognition of professional titles, which would further enhance the benefits of IntET qualification.\n\nThe IntET (UK) qualification is open to U.K.-registered incorporated engineers who have met the requirements: seven years post-graduate experience, two years responsibility of significant engineering work and maintaining continuing professional development. Incorporated engineers who do not hold an accredited degree recognised under the Sydney Accord or equivalent academic qualification, are currently not eligible to apply for IntET (UK) qualification.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Technology and applied sciences}}\n*[[Drafter]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n*{{Cite journal\n|last=Sastry\n|first=M.K.S.\n|author2=Clement K.
