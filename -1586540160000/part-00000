The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T.

This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

Despite Howard, Candice, and Jessie's attempts to break the power couple up, all failed and were subsequently evicted for it.  However, their luck ran out in Week 10 after both Amanda and McCrae were nominated by the HoH, GinaMarie. After failing to win the Power of Veto, Amanda gained the unlikely support of Elissa after she had a change of heart and wanted to vote out Spencer, the post-veto nominee. However, Andy's loyalty lied with his new alliance of \"The Exterminators\" and he double crossed Amanda when he voted with Judd to evict her on Day 77. With the vote tied, GinaMarie broke the tie by voting to evict her. She placed 7th. Amanda voted for Andy to win Big Brother. Amanda was known for her aggressive behavior in the house and she had arguments with most of the houseguests. Many labelled her as a bully especially when she mocked and tortured fellow houseguest, Elissa. Amanda was the only houseguest to confront Aaryn about her offensive and derogatory comments. After the show, Amanda and Elissa made amends and became close friends.

He later joined Aaryn with Amanda and McCrae in an alliance called 3 A.M.\n\nIn Week 7, Andy won his first HoH competition and nominated Jessie and Spencer for eviction. He later won the Power of Veto that same week and decided to keep his nominations the same, leading to Jessie's unanimous eviction. In Week 9, Andy became the replacement nominee after Amanda saved McCrae from the block, but was spared after Aaryn was evicted in a 5\u20130 vote. After Aaryn was evicted, he made the decision to attempt to get rid of McCrae and Amanda, the people who he aligned with most of the game. \"I'm not playing for third place,\" he said. To do this, he secretly became a part of \"The Exterminators\" alliance with GinaMarie, Judd, and Spencer. In creating this alliance, he was sneakily able to play both sides of the house, assuring Amanda and McCrae he was still with them. But his loyalty fell with the Exterminators as the alliance successfully evicted Amanda and Elissa during a double eviction week, but were forced to turn on Judd after McCrae won the Power of Veto in Week 11, saving himself from being exterminated. Andy would go on to win the penultimate HoH competition as well as the final Power of Veto, choosing not to save either McCrae or Spencer and allowing GinaMarie to exterminate McCrae. On finale night, Andy faced off with GinaMarie in the final and third part of the HOH competition. Andy won then chose to evict Spencer and took GinaMarie to the final two. Andy was crowned the winner of Big Brother 15 by a near unanimous vote of 7\u20132 on finale night, only not receiving votes from Aaryn and Judd, who were both former allies of Andy during the game.

She would later be nominated again alongside her ally Helen once Aaryn won her 4th HoH. Once again, Elissa won the Power of Veto on Day 58 and saved herself from post-veto nominations. On Day 63, hours following her main ally Helen's eviction, Elissa won her first Head of Household competition of the season. She nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. While she intended to break up the showmance of Amanda and McCrae, her plan was botched after Amanda won the Power of Veto and removed McCrae from the block, keeping both of them safe. Elissa then nominated Andy afterwards as a replacement and successfully evicted her nemesis, Aaryn. After GinaMarie won HoH and nominated Amanda and McCrae for eviction, Elissa had a change of heart once McCrae won the veto and Spencer was put in his stead. She made a plan to keep Amanda over Spencer and even used her wedding ring as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Unfortunately, Andy was no longer loyal to the power couple and voted against Amanda on Day 77. GinaMarie broke the tie and sent Amanda home. Elissa's luck worsened during the double eviction week after McCrae won the HoH and nominated her for eviction, unaware that Andy had double crossed them. Once Judd won the Power of Veto, Elissa's fate was sealed and Andy's new alliance of \"The Exterminators\" voted her out over GinaMarie in a 3\u20130 vote. She placed 6th. Elissa voted for Andy to win Big Brother. On finale night, she was crowned America's Favorite Houseguest and was awarded the $25,000 prize.\n\n==GinaMarie==\n'''GinaMarie Zimmerman ''' (born August 22, 1980), 32, is from [[Staten Island, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1000477/big-brother-15-cast/39853/|title=Big Brother 15 Cast|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Prior to entering the house, GinaMarie had done some modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/535-big-brother-15-house-guest-ginamarie-zimmerman|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: GinaMarie Zimmerman|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Brooklyn, New York]], she describes herself as being crazy, sexy, and cool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214678/|title=Big Brother Cast: GinaMarie|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> GinaMarie feels that her \"thick skin\" will help her in the game, along with her people skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/ginamarie-zimmerman-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=GinaMarie Zimmerman \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> GinaMarie was part of the Blonde-tourage alliance and stayed particularly loyal to Aaryn throughout the early period of the show. She became infamously known for becoming overly attached to Nick, suffering an emotional breakdown when he was surprisingly evicted on Day 21. GinaMarie was nominated as a replacement M.V.P. nominee in Week 4, but was spared after her ally Kaitlin was evicted. On Day 42, GinaMarie won the Head of Household competition. She nominated Candice and Jessie for eviction the following day. After Amanda was nominated by the MVP and Jessie won the Power of Veto, GinaMarie replaced Jessie with Spencer and Candice was evicted in a unanimous vote. After the eviction of Aaryn in Week 9, GinaMarie joined an alliance with Andy, Judd, and Spencer called the \"Exterminators\" and won her second HoH on Day 70 and chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae, with the intention of splitting up the power couple and putting the exterminators in the final 4. On Day 77, GinaMarie broke the tied vote and evicted Amanda. On the same day, GinaMarie was nominated alongside Elissa during double eviction by McCrae, the HOH. She survived the eviction as Elissa was evicted by a 3\u20130 vote. Spencer then won HOH and nominated GinaMarie (pawn) against McCrae (target). But when McCrae saved himself using the Power of Veto, the exterminators were forced to take out one of their own as Judd was nominated as the replacement to sit next to GinaMarie. Judd was evicted 2\u20130. When Andy won both the final 4 HOH and POV and gave GinaMarie her key, she voted to evict McCrae, putting her, Andy, and Spencer into Finale night.\nOn finale night, GinaMarie won the first part of the final HOH competition. She faced off against Andy in Part 3 and lost. Andy then decided to evict Spencer and take GinaMarie to the final 2. GinaMarie finished in 2nd place and was awarded $50,000 by a vote of 7\u20132, only receiving votes from Aaryn and Judd. After the show, she mended fences and became close friends with Elissa Reilly and even Amanda Zuckerman, the latter which she fought with most of the time.\n\n==Helen==\n'''Helen Kim-Fitzpatrick''' (born May 6, 1976), 37, is a political consultant from [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=\"cbs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214679/|title=Big Brother Cast: Helen|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Falls Church, Virginia]], Helen is married and is the mother of two sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/536-big-brother-15-house-guest-helen-kim|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: Helen Kim|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> She described herself as being stubborn, loyal, and energetic.<ref name=\"cbs.com\" /> Upon entering the house, Helen chose not to reveal to the others that she had a background in politics, feeling as though it could hurt her game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/helen-kim-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=Helen Kim \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> She aligned with Elissa and successfully campaigned to keep her in the house over Nick. On Day 21, Helen won the \"Overnight Delivery\" HOH competition and nominated Aaryn and Kaitlin, though she was able to backdoor Jeremy after Kaitlin won the Power of Veto. Along with the other minorities in the house, Helen was the victim of a variety of racially charged comments made by Aaryn and GinaMarie. On Day 57, Helen was nominated for eviction alongside Elissa by HOH Aaryn. On Day 63, Helen was evicted in a 4\u20131 vote against Spencer. She then participated in the Juror Competition to be allowed back in the house, but did not win. She came in 9th place.

On Day 5, Jessie was nominated for eviction alongside Candice, but was spared after David was nominated by the MVP and subsequently evicted. She became the brunt of the fury from the \"Blonde-tourage\" alliance after she voted to evict Nick from the house and gained a bad reputation from several HouseGuests after trying to form a romantic relationship with different men in the house. Jessie was nominated for eviction alongside Candice again on Day 43 by the Head of Household, GinaMarie. While Amanda tried to rally the house against Jessie following an ugly dispute between the two, Jessie won the Power of Veto. On Day 46, Jessie saved herself from the block and GinaMarie named Spencer as the replacement nominee. On Day 50, Jessie was nominated for eviction alongside Spencer by Andy, the HOH. On Day 56, Jessie was evicted by a unanimous 6\u20130 vote. Because she was one of the first four jurors, Jessie was given the opportunity to compete in the Head of Household competition on Day 63 and win a chance to come back in the game. While she started off with a lead amongst the jurors, she was the first to fall and returned to the jury house, officially finishing the game in 10th place. Jessie voted for Andy to win Big Brother.\n\n==Judd==\n'''Judd Andrew Daugherty''' (born November 26, 1986), 26, is a property appraiser from [[Etowah, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1000477/big-brother-15-cast/39862/|title=Big Brother 15 Cast|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Englewood, Tennessee]], he described himself as being funny, unreadable, and unpredictable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214669/|title=Big Brother Cast: Judd|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Judd has been a huge fan of the series since early on<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/540-big-brother-15-house-guest-judd-daughtery|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: Judd Daughtery|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> and hopes to have a strong social game while in the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/judd-daughtery-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=Judd Daugherty \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> He quickly became well-liked and, due to his good looks and country boy charm, earned the nickname, \"Judd the Stud\" by fans and the rest of the HouseGuests. Judd is known to be highly sociable in the house and has particularly close friendships with Elissa, Andy, Spencer, Aaryn, GinaMarie, McCrae, Helen and Jessie.  Judd was part of the majority alliance called \"The Knockout\", which featured himself, Andy, Elissa, McCrae, Amanda, and Helen. He was also a part of \"The Goof Troupe\" alliance, which was restricted to himself, Andy, McCrae, and Amanda. He won the \"Big Brother Royalty\" HoH competition on Day 28 and nominated Aaryn and Kaitlin for eviction, which led to Kaitlin leaving the house on Day 34. On Day 77, Judd won his first Power of Veto competition. While Judd seemed to have an alliance and budding romance with Jessie early on in the game, their relationship was demolished once Judd stated that Jessie was the most annoying person in the house and that he was faking his feelings for her the entire time. This came about once Judd gravitated towards Aaryn and his \"Goof Troupe\" alliance of Amanda, Andy, and McCrae. These allies would soon turn on him, and Judd was the second casualty of a double eviction week, getting evicted on Day 49 by a unanimous vote of 7\u20130. On Day 63, Judd re-entered the house after becoming the last juror standing in the game. He quickly aligned with the Head of Household, Elissa, to go after his former allies. Judd also formed an alliance with Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer called \"The Exterminators\". On Day 80, after McCrae won Veto, Judd was put up as a replacement nominee and on Day 82 was eliminated, for the second time by a vote of 2\u20130. He placed 5th. Judd voted for GinaMarie to win Big Brother.  Judd was one of the top 3 house guests who was in the running to win the America's Favorite Houseguest prize.\n\n==Kaitlin==\n'''Kaitlin Marie Barnaby''' (born February 19, 1990), 23, is a bartender from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1000477/big-brother-15-cast/39861/|title=Big Brother 15 Cast|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Vadnais Heights, Minnesota]], she described herself as being persevering, tenacious, and analytical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214682/|title=Big Brother Cast: Kaitlin|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> She felt that keeping to herself would help further her in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/541-big-brother-15-house-guest-kaitlin-barnaby|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: Kaitlin Barnaby|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Kaitlin was approached to do the show, rather than having applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/kaitlin-barnaby-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=Kaitlin Barnaby \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> While in the house, Kaitlin had a romantic relationship with Jeremy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/big-brother-15-sex-stripping-and-scheming-on-the-live-feeds.html|title=&apos;Big Brother 15&apos;: Sex, stripping and scheming on the live feeds|work=Zap2It|accessdate=October 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216145153/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/big-brother-15-sex-stripping-and-scheming-on-the-live-feeds.html|archive-date=February 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was part of the \"Blonde-tourage\" alliance, along with Aaryn, Jeremy, Nick, David, GinaMarie, and Jessie.<ref name=\"alliances2\" /> Along with other numerous other HouseGuests, Kaitlin was criticized for several ignorant comments during her time in the house.

However, Spencer (along with McCrae) would later go against the alliance to evict Nick and save Elissa during Week 2. He was nominated as a pawn by the MVP, Elissa, on Day 23, yet escaped eviction in a 9-1-0, receiving one vote from Kaitlin. On Day 36, Spencer was nominated alongside Howard for eviction, but managed to win the Power of Veto on Day 37 and save himself from eviction. On Day 46, Spencer was named the replacement nominee after Jessie used the Power of Veto to save herself from the block. After Candice's eviction, Spencer would be nominated again for three consecutive evictions, but was spared each time at the expense of Judd, Jessie and Helen. Spencer would finally escape the block after Elissa won HoH and targeted the 3 A.M. alliance. He would later form an alliance with Andy, GinaMarie, and Judd (who returned to the game on Day 63) called \"The Exterminators\". On Day 74, Spencer was named the replacement nominee after McCrae used the Power of Veto to save himself for the block. On Day 77, after Amanda and Elissa were evicted, Spencer won his first HOH of the summer. He used this HOH to nominate GinaMarie and McCrae, to hopefully exterminate McCrae and push his alliance into the Final 4. But when McCrae saved himself by winning the veto, he was forced to put up Judd as the replacement. After Judd was evicted, Andy won HOH and nominated Spencer for eviction against McCrae. Once Andy won the veto and kept the nominations the same, GinaMarie cast the sole vote to evict McCrae, pushing Spencer into the Final 3. On finale night, after losing both parts 1 and 2 of the final HOH competition, Andy once again rose to power after winning part 3 of the HOH competition.

Despite Howard, Candice, and Jessie's attempts to break the power couple up, all failed and were subsequently evicted for it.  However, their luck ran out in Week 10 after both Amanda and McCrae were nominated by the HoH, GinaMarie. After failing to win the Power of Veto, Amanda gained the unlikely support of Elissa after she had a change of heart and wanted to vote out Spencer, the post-veto nominee. However, Andy's loyalty lied with his new alliance of \"The Exterminators\" and he double crossed Amanda when he voted with Judd to evict her on Day 77. With the vote tied, GinaMarie broke the tie by voting to evict her. She placed 7th. Amanda voted for Andy to win Big Brother. Amanda was known for her aggressive behavior in the house and she had arguments with most of the houseguests. Many labelled her as a bully especially when she mocked and tortured fellow houseguest, Elissa. Amanda was the only houseguest to confront Aaryn about her offensive and derogatory comments.

He later joined Aaryn with Amanda and McCrae in an alliance called 3 A.M.\n\nIn Week 7, Andy won his first HoH competition and nominated Jessie and Spencer for eviction. He later won the Power of Veto that same week and decided to keep his nominations the same, leading to Jessie's unanimous eviction. In Week 9, Andy became the replacement nominee after Amanda saved McCrae from the block, but was spared after Aaryn was evicted in a 5-0 vote. After Aaryn was evicted, he made the decision to attempt to get rid of McCrae and Amanda, the people who he aligned with most of the game. \"I'm not playing for third place,\" he said. To do this, he secretly became a part of \"The Exterminators\" alliance with GinaMarie, Judd, and Spencer. In creating this alliance, he was sneakily able to play both sides of the house, assuring Amanda and McCrae he was still with them. But his loyalty fell with the Exterminators as the alliance successfully evicted Amanda and Elissa during a double eviction week, but were forced to turn on Judd after McCrae won the Power of Veto in Week 11, saving himself from being exterminated. Andy would go on to win the penultimate HoH competition as well as the final Power of Veto, choosing not to save either McCrae or Spencer and allowing GinaMarie to exterminate McCrae. On finale night, Andy faced off with GinaMarie in the final and third part of the HOH competition. Andy won then chose to evict Spencer and took GinaMarie to the final two. Andy was crowned the winner of Big Brother 15 by a near unanimous vote of 7-2 on finale night, only not receiving votes from Aaryn and Judd, who were both former allies of Andy during the game.

She would later be nominated again alongside her ally Helen once Aaryn won her 4th HoH. Once again, Elissa won the Power of Veto on Day 58 and saved herself from post-veto nominations. On Day 63, hours following her main ally Helen's eviction, Elissa won her first Head of Household competition of the season. She nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. While she intended to break up the showmance of Amanda and McCrae, her plan was botched after Amanda won the Power of Veto and removed McCrae from the block, keeping both of them safe. Elissa then nominated Andy afterwards as a replacement and successfully evicted her nemesis, Aaryn. After GinaMarie won HoH and nominated Amanda and McCrae for eviction, Elissa had a change of heart once McCrae won the veto and Spencer was put in his stead. She made a plan to keep Amanda over Spencer and even used her wedding ring as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Unfortunately, Andy was no longer loyal to the power couple and voted against Amanda on Day 77. GinaMarie broke the tie and sent Amanda home. Elissa's luck worsened during the double eviction week after McCrae won the HoH and nominated her for eviction, unaware that Andy had double crossed them. Once Judd won the Power of Veto, Elissa's fate was sealed and Andy's new alliance of \"The Exterminators\" voted her out over GinaMarie in a 3-0 vote. She placed 6th. Elissa voted for Andy to win Big Brother. On finale night, she was crowned America's Favorite Houseguest and was awarded the $25,000 prize.\n\n==GinaMarie==\n'''GinaMarie Zimmerman ''' (born August 22, 1980), 32, is from [[Staten Island, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1000477/big-brother-15-cast/39853/|title=Big Brother 15 Cast|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Prior to entering the house, GinaMarie had done some modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/535-big-brother-15-house-guest-ginamarie-zimmerman|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: GinaMarie Zimmerman|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Brooklyn, New York]], she describes herself as being crazy, sexy, and cool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214678/|title=Big Brother Cast: GinaMarie|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> GinaMarie feels that her \"thick skin\" will help her in the game, along with her people skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/ginamarie-zimmerman-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=GinaMarie Zimmerman \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> GinaMarie was part of the Blonde-tourage alliance and stayed particularly loyal to Aaryn throughout the early period of the show. She became infamously known for becoming overly attached to Nick, suffering an emotional breakdown when he was surprisingly evicted on Day 21. GinaMarie was nominated as a replacement M.V.P. nominee in Week 4, but was spared after her ally Kaitlin was evicted. On Day 42, GinaMarie won the Head of Household competition. She nominated Candice and Jessie for eviction the following day. After Amanda was nominated by the MVP and Jessie won the Power of Veto, GinaMarie replaced Jessie with Spencer and Candice was evicted in a unanimous vote. After the eviction of Aaryn in Week 9, GinaMarie joined an alliance with Andy, Judd, and Spencer called the \"Exterminators\" and won her second HoH on Day 70 and chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae, with the intention of splitting up the power couple and putting the exterminators in the final 4. On Day 77, GinaMarie broke the tied vote and evicted Amanda. On the same day, GinaMarie was nominated alongside Elissa during double eviction by McCrae, the HOH. She survived the eviction as Elissa was evicted by a 3-0 vote. Spencer then won HOH and nominated GinaMarie (pawn) against McCrae (target). But when McCrae saved himself using the Power of Veto, the exterminators were forced to take out one of their own as Judd was nominated as the replacement to sit next to GinaMarie. Judd was evicted 2-0. When Andy won both the final 4 HOH and POV and gave GinaMarie her key, she voted to evict McCrae, putting her, Andy, and Spencer into Finale night.\nOn finale night, GinaMarie won the first part of the final HOH competition. She faced off against Andy in Part 3 and lost. Andy then decided to evict Spencer and take GinaMarie to the final 2. GinaMarie finished in 2nd place and was awarded $50,000 by a vote of 7-2, only receiving votes from Aaryn and Judd. After the show, she mended fences and became close friends with Elissa Reilly and even Amanda Zuckerman, the latter which she fought with most of the time.\n\n==Helen==\n'''Helen Kim-Fitzpatrick''' (born May 6, 1976), 37, is a political consultant from [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=\"cbs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214679/|title=Big Brother Cast: Helen|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Falls Church, Virginia]], Helen is married and is the mother of two sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/536-big-brother-15-house-guest-helen-kim|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: Helen Kim|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> She described herself as being stubborn, loyal, and energetic.<ref name=\"cbs.com\" /> Upon entering the house, Helen chose not to reveal to the others that she had a background in politics, feeling as though it could hurt her game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/helen-kim-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=Helen Kim \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> She aligned with Elissa and successfully campaigned to keep her in the house over Nick. On Day 21, Helen won the \"Overnight Delivery\" HOH competition and nominated Aaryn and Kaitlin, though she was able to backdoor Jeremy after Kaitlin won the Power of Veto. Along with the other minorities in the house, Helen was the victim of a variety of racially charged comments made by Aaryn and GinaMarie. On Day 57, Helen was nominated for eviction alongside Elissa by HOH Aaryn. On Day 63, Helen was evicted in a 4-1 vote against Spencer. She then participated in the Juror Competition to be allowed back in the house, but did not win. She came in 9th place.

She became the brunt of the fury from the \"Blonde-tourage\" alliance after she voted to evict Nick from the house and gained a bad reputation from several HouseGuests after trying to form a romantic relationship with different men in the house. Jessie was nominated for eviction alongside Candice again on Day 43 by the Head of Household, GinaMarie. While Amanda tried to rally the house against Jessie following an ugly dispute between the two, Jessie won the Power of Veto. On Day 46, Jessie saved herself from the block and GinaMarie named Spencer as the replacement nominee. On Day 50, Jessie was nominated for eviction alongside Spencer by Andy, the HOH. On Day 56, Jessie was evicted by a unanimous 6-0 vote. Because she was one of the first four jurors, Jessie was given the opportunity to compete in the Head of Household competition on Day 63 and win a chance to come back in the game. While she started off with a lead amongst the jurors, she was the first to fall and returned to the jury house, officially finishing the game in 10th place. Jessie voted for Andy to win Big Brother.\n\n==Judd==\n'''Judd Andrew Daugherty''' (born November 26, 1986), 26, is a property appraiser from [[Etowah, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1000477/big-brother-15-cast/39862/|title=Big Brother 15 Cast|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Englewood, Tennessee]], he described himself as being funny, unreadable, and unpredictable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214669/|title=Big Brother Cast: Judd|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Judd has been a huge fan of the series since early on<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/540-big-brother-15-house-guest-judd-daughtery|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: Judd Daughtery|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> and hopes to have a strong social game while in the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/judd-daughtery-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=Judd Daugherty \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> He quickly became well-liked and, due to his good looks and country boy charm, earned the nickname, \"Judd the Stud\" by fans and the rest of the HouseGuests. Judd is known to be highly sociable in the house and has particularly close friendships with Elissa, Andy, Spencer, Aaryn, GinaMarie, McCrae, Helen and Jessie.  Judd was part of the majority alliance called \"The Knockout\", which featured himself, Andy, Elissa, McCrae, Amanda, and Helen. He was also a part of \"The Goof Troupe\" alliance, which was restricted to himself, Andy, McCrae, and Amanda. He won the \"Big Brother Royalty\" HoH competition on Day 28 and nominated Aaryn and Kaitlin for eviction, which led to Kaitlin leaving the house on Day 34. On Day 77, Judd won his first Power of Veto competition. While Judd seemed to have an alliance and budding romance with Jessie early on in the game, their relationship was demolished once Judd stated that Jessie was the most annoying person in the house and that he was faking his feelings for her the entire time. This came about once Judd gravitated towards Aaryn and his \"Goof Troupe\" alliance of Amanda, Andy, and McCrae. These allies would soon turn on him, and Judd was the second casualty of a double eviction week, getting evicted on Day 49 by a unanimous vote of 7-0. On Day 63, Judd re-entered the house after becoming the last juror standing in the game. He quickly aligned with the Head of Household, Elissa, to go after his former allies. Judd also formed an alliance with Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer called \"The Exterminators\". On Day 80, after McCrae won Veto, Judd was put up as a replacement nominee and on Day 82 was eliminated, for the second time by a vote of 2-0. He placed 5th. Judd voted for GinaMarie to win Big Brother.  Judd was one of the top 3 house guests who was in the running to win the America's Favorite Houseguest prize.\n\n==Kaitlin==\n'''Kaitlin Marie Barnaby''' (born February 19, 1990), 23, is a bartender from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/photos/1000477/big-brother-15-cast/39861/|title=Big Brother 15 Cast|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Originally from [[Vadnais Heights, Minnesota]], she described herself as being persevering, tenacious, and analytical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214682/|title=Big Brother Cast: Kaitlin|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CBS|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> She felt that keeping to herself would help further her in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgrapevine.com/index.php/big-brother-15-house-guests/541-big-brother-15-house-guest-kaitlin-barnaby|title=Big Brother 15 House Guest: Kaitlin Barnaby|author=Sammi-T|work=tvgrapevine.com|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> Kaitlin was approached to do the show, rather than having applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/kaitlin-barnaby-big-brother-15-houseguest/|title=Kaitlin Barnaby \u2013 Big Brother 15 Houseguest|work=Big Brother 17|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> While in the house, Kaitlin had a romantic relationship with Jeremy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/big-brother-15-sex-stripping-and-scheming-on-the-live-feeds.html|title=&apos;Big Brother 15&apos;: Sex, stripping and scheming on the live feeds|work=Zap2It|accessdate=October 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216145153/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/big-brother-15-sex-stripping-and-scheming-on-the-live-feeds.html|archive-date=February 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was part of the \"Blonde-tourage\" alliance, along with Aaryn, Jeremy, Nick, David, GinaMarie, and Jessie.<ref name=\"alliances2\" /> Along with other numerous other HouseGuests, Kaitlin was criticized for several ignorant comments during her time in the house.

However, Spencer (along with McCrae) would later go against the alliance to evict Nick and save Elissa during Week 2. He was nominated as a pawn by the MVP, Elissa, on Day 23, yet escaped eviction in a 9-1-0, receiving one vote from Kaitlin. On Day 36, Spencer was nominated alongside Howard for eviction, but managed to win the Power of Veto on Day 37 and save himself from eviction. On Day 46, Spencer was named the replacement nominee after Jessie used the Power of Veto to save herself from the block. After Candice's eviction, Spencer would be nominated again for three consecutive evictions, but was spared each time at the expense of Judd, Jessie and Helen. Spencer would finally escape the block after Elissa won HoH and targeted the 3 A.M. alliance. He would later form an alliance with Andy, GinaMarie, and Judd (who returned to the game on Day 63) called \"The Exterminators\". On Day 74, Spencer was named the replacement nominee after McCrae used the Power of Veto to save himself for the block. On Day 77, after Amanda and Elissa were evicted, Spencer won his first HOH of the summer. He used this HOH to nominate GinaMarie and McCrae, to hopefully exterminate McCrae and push his alliance into the Final 4. But when McCrae saved himself by winning the veto, he was forced to put up Judd as the replacement. After Judd was evicted, Andy won HOH and nominated Spencer for eviction against McCrae. Once Andy won the veto and kept the nominations the same, GinaMarie cast the sole vote to evict McCrae, pushing Spencer into the Final 3. On finale night, after losing both parts 1 and 2 of the final HOH competition, Andy once again rose to power after winning part 3 of the HOH competition. He cast the sole vote to evict Spencer, taking GinaMarie to the finale over him. He came in 3rd place. Spencer voted for Andy to win Big Brother.\n\nSpencer currently holds the record for having the most nominations in a single season with eight post-veto nominations. This also does not include the nomination he was able to veto in Week 5, technically bringing his total to nine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Big Brother in the United States}}\n\n{{italic title|string=Big Brother 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Big Brother 15 Houseguests (U.S.)}}\n[[Category:Big Brother (American TV series) contestants| 15]]\n[[Category:Lists of reality show participants|Big Brother 15 houseguests (U.S.)]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 5-0 \u2192 5\u20130 (6), 2-0 \u2192 2\u20130 (4)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Big_Brother_15_(American_season)_houseguests"}

It was nominated for a Gemini Award in 1996 in the category of Best Children's Program or Series.\n\n==Format==\nEach ''Mighty Machines'' episode focuses on a specific type of heavy equipment or work environment. Documentary footage of actual machines in action doing their day-to-day work is presented with [[voiceover]]s of the machines addressing the viewers. The children in the audience are invited to follow the machines during a typical day. They explain their abilities and their duties in detail over the course of the episode. Each machine is given its own personality and they often hold conversations with one another as they work. Unlike most documentary-style shows, there is no external narrator.\n\nThe first-season episodes were done in two formats for broadcast: twenty-two-minute full episodes, and five-minute excerpts for use as filler.\n\n==Production==\n''Mighty Machines'' first aired as a production of [[Malofilm]], the first season in 1994, second in 2004, and third in 2008 (done by Loten Media, and distributed by Seville Pictures). Most of the episodes were filmed in Toronto, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Roanoke, Virginia, USA.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe show airs on [[TVOntario|TVO]], [[Treehouse TV]] and other channels in Canada, including [[Access (TV channel)|Access]] in Alberta, the [[Saskatchewan Communications Network]], and [[Knowledge (TV channel)|Knowledge]] in British Columbia.

The short film, which runs five minutes, stars Tinny, a tin [[one-man-band]] toy, attempting to escape from Billy, a destructive infant. The third short film produced by the company's small animation division, it was a risky investment: due to low revenue produced by Pixar's main product, the [[Pixar Image Computer]], the company was under financial constraints.\n\nLasseter pitched the concept for ''Tin Toy'' by storyboard to Pixar owner [[Steve Jobs]], who agreed to finance the short despite the company's struggles, which he kept alive with annual investment. The film was officially a test of the [[PhotoRealistic RenderMan]] software, and proved new challenges to the animation team, namely the difficult task of realistically animating Billy. ''Tin Toy'' later gained attention from [[Disney]], who sealed an agreement to create ''[[Toy Story]]'' starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], which was primarily inspired by elements from ''Tin Toy''.\n\nThe short premiered in a partially completed edit at the [[SIGGRAPH]] convention in August 1988 to a standing ovation from scientists and engineers. ''Tin Toy'' went on to claim Pixar's first Oscar with the 1988 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], becoming the first [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film to win an Oscar. With the award, ''Tin Toy'' went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. ''Tin Toy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2003.<ref name = \"JimHillMedia\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in one room and stars the toy of the title, a mechanical one-man band player named Tinny, and a baby named Billy. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the infant can be. When Tinny tries to walk out of Billy's reach, the musical instruments, which are on his back, play notes, and accidentally attract Billy's attention. Tinny begins to run, but is chased by Billy. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch, only to find that many other toys have also hidden themselves from Billy there since they are also afraid of the baby, and have learned the same experience. Unaware of this, while walking and trying to find Tinny and the other toys, Billy tumbles helplessly over, and lies quietly on the floor, and starts bawling. Tinny, feeling sorry for the baby, goes to the child in an attempt to cheer him up. Billy, upon seeing Tinny, stops wailing, cheers up, and grabs the toy, but shakes him around for a few moments, and ignores him while being distracted by the box Tinny was packaged in to played with. Annoyed, Tinny follows Billy around the room an attempt to get his attention but is still ignored. Then he pursues Billy who is instead even more happier playing with boxes and shopping bag while some toys come out from the couch to play. (Also they play together at the end to make the theme come to life)\n\n==Background==\nPixar, purchased in 1986 by entrepreneur and former [[Apple Computer]] head [[Steve Jobs]], received many accolades for films produced by its small animation division, headed by animator John Lasseter. Lasseter's primary role, as defended to Jobs by company founders Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, was to produce short films to promote the company's own Pixar Image Computers.<ref name=\"PixarTouch01\">Price, p. 89</ref> The department was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned, but after the release of two shorts, ''[[Luxo Jr.]]'' (1986) and ''[[Red's Dream]]'' (1987), some of the engineers working on the company's products wondered whether it made sense to keep the animation group going at all.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\">Price, p. 103</ref> Pixar was losing money every year and Jobs were supporting the cash-strapped company SO through a line of credit with his personal guarantee.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 104</ref>\n\nThe engineers felt they were working hard to make money for Pixar while Lasseter's group was only spending it. Their passion was for building computers and software, not entertainment. Eventually, they discerned, to their chagrin, the reason why the company was supporting the division: the real priority of Catmull and Smith was to make films.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> The engineers were not alone in wondering about the value of Lasseter's short films. On repeated occasions in the late 1980s, Catmull barely dissuaded Jobs from shutting down the animation division due to financial constraints. At this same time, Jobs was clashing with Alvy Ray Smith, which would eventually lead to his resignation from Pixar after a heated argument during a meeting. Things were by no means well at the company and Lasseter and his team of animators knew this, and were afraid to ask for money to finance another short, which they storyboarded as ''Tin Toy''.<ref name=\"Issacson01\">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/247 247]|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn the spring of 1988, cash was running so short that Jobs convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. The short would require close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards.<ref name=\"Issacson01\"/> Catmull took him down to the animation offices, and Lasseter started his show. With the storyboards pinned on his wall, Lasseter did the voices and acted out the shots\u2014just as story men had done on the Disney lot for decades\u2014and thereby showed his passion for the project.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/><ref name=\"Issacson01\"/> The stakes here were much higher than before, however.

Lasseter said \"In terms of toys the child must have seemed a terrible monster!\"<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 305</ref>\n\nThe story was about Lasseter's love, classic toys, and was inspired by a visit made in 1987 at the Tin Toy Museum in [[Yokohama, Japan]].<ref>\"Audio commentary to the short Tin Toy\". [[John Lasseter]]</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Amidi | pages=23}}</ref> It was told from the perspective of a toy one-man band named Tinny, who meets a baby that charms and terrorizes him. Escaping under the couch, Tinny finds other frightened toys, but when the baby hits his head and cries, Tinny goes back out to cheer him up.<ref name=\"Issacson01\"/> ''Tin Toy'' was inspired much like ''Luxo Jr.'', namely, Lasseter's observations of a friend's baby. This time, he opted for a more ambitious task, attempting to mimic a human baby in its appearance, the movement of its arms, and its fickle moods.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/>\n\nThe film was officially a test of the [[PhotoRealistic RenderMan]] software.<ref name = \"InfoWorld\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT20&lpg=PT20&dq=%22tin+toy%22+pixar+%22PhotoRealistic+RenderMan%22&source=bl&ots=Ubj9MXhEVM&sig=8jWCVxSyjWC0mK8eAozIYb_raBM&hl=en&ei=qH9fTJyaIoScOJbNmb0J&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22tin%20toy%22%20pixar%20%22PhotoRealistic%20RenderMan%22&f=false |title=InfoWorld - 27 Feb 1989 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1989-02-27 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> This was the only Pixar short rendered on the RM-1, a RenderMan specific computer that was never sold to the public.<ref name=\"Renderman CGWiki\">{{cite web |url=http://wiki.cgsociety.org/index.php/Renderman |title=Renderman - CGWiki |publisher=Wiki.cgsociety.org |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2010-10-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721100705/http://wiki.cgsociety.org/index.php/Renderman |archivedate=2012-07-21 }}</ref><ref name = \"Google Books\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jM5EZC1rs4C&pg=PA509&lpg=PA509&dq=tin+toy+pixar+%22rm-1%22+machine&source=bl&ots=Tkf9VoN8FT&sig=gCwg7wXi_yPg3WcJKix5ae2f_fE&hl=en&ei=73tfTLKUEt6gOPef9LwJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCgQ6AEwBQ |title=Advanced RenderMan: creating CGI for motion pictures |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> As with ''Luxo Jr.'' and ''Red's Dream'', it was also a chance for Lasseter to one-up his earlier efforts, taking his animation and storytelling to another level.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/> The baby proved difficult to model and animate; \"it just became an incredible burden,\" remembered Flip Phillips, a new member of the team at the time.

The short film, which runs five minutes, stars Tinny, a tin [[one-man-band]] toy, attempting to escape from Billy, a destructive infant. The third short film produced by the company's small animation division, it was a risky investment: due to low revenue produced by Pixar's main product, the [[Pixar Image Computer]], the company was under financial constraints.\n\nLasseter pitched the concept for ''Tin Toy'' by storyboard to Pixar owner [[Steve Jobs]], who agreed to finance the short despite the company's struggles, which he kept alive with annual investment. The film was officially a test of the [[PhotoRealistic RenderMan]] software, and proved new challenges to the animation team, namely the difficult task of realistically animating Billy. ''Tin Toy'' later gained attention from [[Disney]], who sealed an agreement to create ''[[Toy Story]]'' starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], which was primarily inspired by elements from ''Tin Toy''.\n\nThe short premiered in a partially completed edit at the [[SIGGRAPH]] convention in August 1988 to a standing ovation from scientists and engineers. ''Tin Toy'' went on to claim Pixar's first Oscar with the 1988 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], becoming the first [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film to win an Oscar. With the award, ''Tin Toy'' went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. ''Tin Toy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2003.<ref name = \"JimHillMedia\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in one room and stars the toy of the title, a mechanical one-man band player named Tinny, and a baby named Billy. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the infant can be. When Tinny tries to walk out of Billy's reach, the musical instruments, which are on his back, play notes, and accidentally attract Billy's attention. Tinny begins to run, but is chased by Billy. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch, only to find that many other toys have also hidden themselves from Billy there since they are also afraid of the baby, and have learned the same experience. Unaware of this, while walking and trying to find Tinny and the other toys, Billy tumbles helplessly over, and lies quietly on the floor, and starts bawling. Tinny, feeling sorry for the baby, goes to the child in an attempt to cheer him up. Billy, upon seeing Tinny, stops wailing, cheers up, and grabs the toy, but shakes him around for a few moments, and ignores him while being distracted by the box Tinny was packaged in to played with. Annoyed, Tinny follows Billy around the room an attempt to get his attention but is still ignored. Then he pursues Billy who is instead even more happier playing with boxes and shopping bag while some toys come out from the couch to play. (Also they play together at the end to make the theme come to life)\n\n==Background==\nPixar, purchased in 1986 by entrepreneur and former [[Apple Computer]] head [[Steve Jobs]], received many accolades for films produced by its small animation division, headed by animator John Lasseter. Lasseter's primary role, as defended to Jobs by company founders Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, was to produce short films to promote the company's own Pixar Image Computers.<ref name=\"PixarTouch01\">Price, p. 89</ref> The department was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned, but after the release of two shorts, ''[[Luxo Jr.]]'' (1986) and ''[[Red's Dream]]'' (1987), some of the engineers working on the company's products wondered whether it made sense to keep the animation group going at all.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\">Price, p. 103</ref> Pixar was losing money every year and Jobs were supporting the cash-strapped company SO through a line of credit with his personal guarantee.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 104</ref>\n\nThe engineers felt they were working hard to make money for Pixar while Lasseter's group was only spending it. Their passion was for building computers and software, not entertainment. Eventually, they discerned, to their chagrin, the reason why the company was supporting the division: the real priority of Catmull and Smith was to make films.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> The engineers were not alone in wondering about the value of Lasseter's short films. On repeated occasions in the late 1980s, Catmull barely dissuaded Jobs from shutting down the animation division due to financial constraints. At this same time, Jobs was clashing with Alvy Ray Smith, which would eventually lead to his resignation from Pixar after a heated argument during a meeting. Things were by no means well at the company and Lasseter and his team of animators knew this, and were afraid to ask for money to finance another short, which they storyboarded as ''Tin Toy''.<ref name=\"Issacson01\">{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/247 247]|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn the spring of 1988, cash was running so short that Jobs convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. The short would require close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards.<ref name=\"Issacson01\"/> Catmull took him down to the animation offices, and Lasseter started his show. With the storyboards pinned on his wall, Lasseter did the voices and acted out the shots\u2014just as story men had done on the Disney lot for decades\u2014and thereby showed his passion for the project.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/><ref name=\"Issacson01\"/> The stakes here were much higher than before, however.

Lasseter said \"In terms of toys the child must have seemed a terrible monster!\"<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 305</ref>\n\nThe story was about Lasseter's love, classic toys, and was inspired by a visit made in 1987 at the Tin Toy Museum in [[Yokohama, Japan]].<ref>\"Audio commentary to the short Tin Toy\". [[John Lasseter]]</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Amidi | pages=23}}</ref> It was told from the perspective of a toy one-man band named Tinny, who meets a baby that charms and terrorizes him.

The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA conquered the AIAW and usurped its authority and membership.\n\n[[Williams Ephs|Williams]] has won the most national championships, with 10 national titles. [[Wesleyan Cardinals|Wesleyan]] is the reigning national champion, winning its first title in 2019 beating the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in a 5-4 clincher a year after they beat Emory for the 2018

In a typical colorimetric gas detector tube a known volume of air is pumped through a tube using a pump. The tube typically has a layer which indicates the analyte by changing colour, depending on the amount of the gas which has passed through the tube the length of the zone which has changed colour will be different.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/87/10018750/tubeshandbook_br_9092086_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070502/http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/87/10018750/tubeshandbook_br_9092086_en.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"dragerinrussia\">{{cite web| url=http://dmliefer.ru/ru/content/drager| title=Dr\u00e4ger in Russia| accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> Today colorimetric gas detector tubes are used throughout industry as a low-cost and easy-to-use tool for detecting the presence of gases and are available from a wide range of manufacturers.\n\nAn early limitation of detector tubes is that they were designed to detect a single known gas or vapor. Advancements in the design and capability of detector tubes came with the introduction of such tools as the HazMat kit. The specialty kits are designed for use by hazardous material response teams in determining what gases or vapors are present through using a \"stack\" of colorimetric material that change color based upon the presence of an organic or inorganic gas.\n\n=== Alcohol Screening Kits ===\nDr\u00e4ger developed their first Alcohol screening kit in 1953 when some employees came into work hungover following a party the night before. It was originally developed using silicon crystals, where a breath sample was passed through these silicon crystals, if there was alcohol in this breath sample, a chemical reaction would occur resulting in the crystals changing colour. This particular method is still used today to create \"single use breathalyzers.\"\n\nDr\u00e4ger's first digital display Alcohol Screening Kit was developed in 1980. Later they developed a breathalyzer that uses a fuel sensor. Many of Dr\u00e4gers breathalyzers have [[HOTA|home office approva]]<nowiki/>l, which means they can be used by the police in a variety of countries, including the UK.\n\n==Diving equipment==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0712-502, Berlin, Taucherarbeiten.jpg|thumb|Dr\u00e4ger three-bolt ''bubikopf'' helmet in use for surface supplied diving]]\n[[File:DM40 thm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Helmeted diver entering the water.

Two versions were available, one for oxygen to 20 metres, and the other for nitrox to 40 metres. The semi-closed circuit used the injected gas to circulate the gas in the helmet through a scrubber, providing a very low work of breathing in comparison with most other rebreathers which used the lungs of the diver to circulate gas in the loop. The ''bubikopf'' helmet was designed for use with this system. The rebreather loop hoses connected to the back of the helmet below the overhanging part, and led from there to the back-mounted scrubber.\n\nSince 1941 [[Hans Hass]] used bag-on-back rebreathers for scuba diving, originally built by Dr\u00e4ger for self-rescue of submarine crews ([[escape set|Tauchretter]]; like the [[Davis Escape Set]]). The first Dr\u00e4ger-''Tauchretter '' had been built in 1907.

In a typical colorimetric gas detector tube a known volume of air is pumped through a tube using a pump. The tube typically has a layer which indicates the analyte by changing colour, depending on the amount of the gas which has passed through the tube the length of the zone which has changed colour will be different.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/87/10018750/tubeshandbook_br_9092086_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070502/http://www.draeger.com/media/10/01/87/10018750/tubeshandbook_br_9092086_en.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"dragerinrussia\">{{cite web| url=http://dmliefer.ru/ru/content/drager| title=Dr\u00e4ger in Russia| accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> Today colorimetric gas detector tubes are used throughout industry as a low-cost and easy-to-use tool for detecting the presence of gases and are available from a wide range of manufacturers.\n\nAn early limitation of detector tubes is that they were designed to detect a single known gas or vapor. Advancements in the design and capability of detector tubes came with the introduction of such tools as the HazMat kit. The specialty kits are designed for use by hazardous material response teams in determining what gases or vapors are present through using a \"stack\" of colorimetric material that change color based upon the presence of an organic or inorganic gas.\n\n=== Alcohol Screening Kits ===\nDr\u00e4ger developed their first Alcohol screening kit in 1953 when some employees came into work hungover following a party the night before. It was originally developed using silicon crystals, where a breath sample was passed through these silicon crystals, if there was alcohol in this breath sample, a chemical reaction would occur resulting in the crystals changing colour. This particular method is still used today to create \"single use breathalyzers.\"\n\nDr\u00e4ger's first digital display Alcohol Screening Kit was developed in 1980. Later they developed a breathalyzer that uses a fuel sensor. Many of Dr\u00e4gers breathalyzers have [[HOTA|home office approva]]<nowiki/>l, which means they can be used by the police in a variety of countries, including the UK.\n\n==Diving equipment==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0712-502, Berlin, Taucherarbeiten.jpg|thumb|Dr\u00e4ger three-bolt ''bubikopf'' helmet in use for surface supplied diving]]\n[[File:DM40 thm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Helmeted diver entering the water.

Two versions were available, one for oxygen to 20 metres, and the other for nitrox to 40 metres. The semi-closed circuit used the injected gas to circulate the gas in the helmet through a scrubber, providing a very low work of breathing in comparison with most other rebreathers which used the lungs of the diver to circulate gas in the loop. The ''bubikopf'' helmet was designed for use with this system. The rebreather loop hoses connected to the back of the helmet below the overhanging part, and led from there to the back-mounted scrubber.\n\nSince 1941 [[Hans Hass]] used bag-on-back rebreathers for for scuba diving, originally built by Dr\u00e4ger for self-rescue of submarine crews ([[escape set|Tauchretter]]; like the [[Davis Escape Set]]).
