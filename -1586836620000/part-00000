The winner of the first mission would be given an advantage to his/her team in the race.

In the rather fast-paced urban societies in Asia, the show helps to provide release from the daily tensions that such streets and buildings are associated with.\"<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" /> Liew thinks that the cast members are not particularly good looking, thus have nothing to lose, even if they \"wrestle with one another like children\".<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" />\n\nAccording to producer Jo Hyo-jin, the show is popular because the concept of having to choose a winner is culturally easy to understand. He also named the good relationship between the regular members as one of the reasons for the show's success.<ref name=\"straits2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.herworldplus.com/celebs/updates/and-running-running-mans-creator-speaks|title=Off and running: Running Man's creator speaks|date=2012-12-12|publisher=The Straits Times via Singapore Press Holdings|accessdate=2014-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228054357/http://www.herworldplus.com/celebs/updates/and-running-running-mans-creator-speaks|archive-date=2014-02-28|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Celebrity guests like [[Super Junior]], [[Girls' Generation]] and [[f(x) (group)|f(x)]] play an important part in the success as well, although they sometimes induce criticism. For example, after the airing of the [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] episodes, some viewers complained that the band won too easily. Jo Hyo-jin, however, denied any special treatment of the celebrities. Jo explained that fans are also highly critical of the games, therefore it is not possible for the crew to reuse games without changing them.<ref name=\"straits2\" />\n\nThe regular members of ''Running Man'' have held several fan meetings throughout Asia.

The MCs and guests were locked inside a landmark and were required to earn ''Running Balls'' for a chance to escape punishment.

The format for the missions in episodes 26 to 43 were:\n* Mission 1 was the race mission, ''Find the Guests''. From episodes 39 to 41, it was ''Catch the Running Man''.\n* Mission 2 featured games related to the landmark.\n* Mission 3 was the ''One Chance'' challenge, which was played in episodes 27 to 31.\nIf there were many members with no ''Running Balls'', they were automatically punished and no lottery was conducted. Additionally, if the members succeeded in the ''One Chance'' mission, they were all relieved of the punishment regardless of how many ''Running Balls'' each of them possessed.

Teams were decided by the winner of the ''race mission'', who received the first ''Running Ball'', and the two teams then competed for more ''Running Balls'' throughout missions spread over two days (two episodes). The format for the missions was as follows:\n* Mission 1 was the ''race mission'', ''Find the Guests''.\n* Mission 2 featured missions related to the staff of the landmark.\n* Mission 3 was a second ''race mission''.\n* Mission 4 featured missions related to the landmark.\nThe team with the most ''Running Balls'' was declared the winner and their supporters received a bonus from their boss.\n|-\n| 119, 131, 144\n| November 11, 2012; February 3, 2013; May 5, 2013\n| In these episodes, the members would arrive at the starting venue separately. An announcer would announce that \"The XX Running Man is entering the arena\". This announcement would include the guests for the day. After all the guest were introduced, the announcer would immediately announce their first mission. The race would officially begin after the first mission ends. The winner of the first mission would be given an advantage to his/her team in the race. The format for the missions are as follows:\n* Mission 1 was the ''opening mission'': ''Name Tag Elimination''\n* Mission 2 onwards would follow the usual format of the show: one long race with continuous missions during the race.\n|}\n\n== Personnel ==\n{{Main|List of Running Man cast members}}\n\n=== Production staff ===\nThe staff run the games, often showing up on camera either by actively participating in the game or influencing the outcome of various missions.\n\nThis includes the personal cameramen (VJs), production directors (PDs), floor directors (FDs), stylists, boom operators, etc.\n\nChief producer, Nam Seung-yong, is responsible for the production of the program, with PD Jo Hyo-jin, Im Hyung-taek, and Kim Joo-hyung<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/List/Enter/3/09/20131028/58503932/1|script-title=ko:\uc774\uad11\uc218 \uc608\ub2a5-\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8-\uad11\uace0 3\ubc15\uc790 \ub2e4 \ud1b5\ud588\ub2e4|publisher=Donga|date=2013-10-28|accessdate=2014-01-28|language=Korean|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120558/http://news.donga.com/List/Enter/3/09/20131028/58503932/1|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}</ref> mainly responsible for the directing and production of the recordings of the program since inception.

In the rather fast-paced urban societies in Asia, the show helps to provide release from the daily tensions that such streets and buildings are associated with.\"<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" /> Liew thinks that the cast members are not particularly good looking, thus have nothing to lose, even if they \"wrestle with one another like children\".<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" />\n\nAccording to producer Jo Hyo-jin, the show is popular because the concept of having to choose a winner is culturally easy to understand.

For example, after the airing of the [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] episodes, some viewers complained that the band won too easily. Jo Hyo-jin, however, denied any special treatment of the celebrities. Jo explained that fans are also highly critical of the games, therefore it is not possible for the crew to reuse games without changing them.<ref name=\"straits2\" />\n\nThe regular members of ''Running Man'' have held several fan meetings throughout Asia.

He is currently the Chancellor's Professor at the UC Irvine School of Humanities\u2019 Department of Comparative Literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Releases|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/press_release_det.php?id=347|website=UCI SoH|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\nBorn in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India, Aijaz Ahmad and his parents migrated to [[Pakistan]] following [[Partition of India|partition]]. After his education he worked in various universities in US and Canada. Before joining UC Irvine in 2017, he was professorial fellow at the Centre of Contemporary Studies, [[Nehru Memorial Museum and Library]], [[New Delhi]] and was visiting professor of [[political science]] at [[York University, Toronto]].  He also works as an editorial consultant with the [[India]]n newsmagazine ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' and as a senior news analyst for the Indian website [[Newsclick]].\n\n==Work==\n\nIn his book ''In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures'', Ahmad primarily discusses the role of theory and theorists in the movement against colonialism and imperialism. Ahmad's argument against those who uphold poststructuralism and postmodernist conceptions of material history revolves around the fact that very little has been accomplished since the advent of this brand of postcolonial inquiry. The book contains an especially polemical critique of [[Frederic Jameson]]'s argument in \"Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism\" where Ahmad attacks Jameson on the grounds that Jameson's argument is insufficiently theorized in its use of terms like \"Third World\" which appears to be defined purely in terms of its experience of colonialism. This in turn leads Jameson to make hasty and untenable generalizations about how all \"third world literature\" would necessarily function as a national allegory that according to Jameson works as resistance to a system of global postmodernism.\n\nAhmad in his book expresses his chagrin at how his critique of Jameson has been appropriated by Postcolonial scholars as an attack on Marxism, while Ahmad contends that he takes issue with Jameson simply because his use of Marxism in the essay on Third World Literature is not rigorous enough. \nThe book also contains a lengthy critique of Edward Said's ''[[Orientalism]]'' which Ahmad argues reproduces the very Liberal Humanist tradition that it seeks to undermine in its selection of Western canonized texts that are critiqued for their Orientalism, as this upholds the idea that Western culture is represented in its entirety through those very texts. Furthermore, Ahmad asserts that by tracing Orientalist thought all the way back to Ancient Greece it becomes unclear in Said's work whether Orientalism is a product of Colonialism, or whether Colonialism is, in fact, a product of Orientalism.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n#[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr89RWtWDjoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false ''In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures''] - Verso, 1992. \n# ''A World To Win: Essays on the Communist Manifesto'' - with [[Irfan Habib]] & [[Prabhat Patnaik]], LeftWord Books, 1999. \n#[https://books.google.com/books?id=r3rAQDUm898C&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=Lineages+of+the+Present:+Ideological+and+Political+Genealogies+of+Contemporary+South+Asia&source=bl&ots=b9ZLtNGwSU&sig=Jdp-TlwEFjWw_--8tMlqMrzv_sc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz55Pw9PXXAhUFOI8KHUVzArIQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Lineages of the Present:  Ideological and Political Genealogies of Contemporary South Asia''] - Verso, 2001. \n#''[http://www.threeessays.com/books/on-communalism-and-globalization/ On Communalism and Globalization: Offensives of the Far Right]'' - Three Essays Collective, New Delhi, 2002. \n#''Iraq, Afghanistan and the Imperialism of Our Time'' - [[LeftWord Books]], New Delhi, 2004. \n#''In Our Time: Empire, Politics, Culture'' - Verso, 2007\n\n'''Edited'''\n# ''Ghazals of Ghalib'' - ed. by Aijaz Ahmad.

He is currently the Chancellor's Professor at the UC Irvine School of Humanities\u2019 Department of Comparative Literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Releases|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/press_release_det.php?id=347|website=UCI SoH|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\nBorn in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India, Aijaz Ahmad and his parents migrated to [[Pakistan]] following [[Partition of India|partition]]. After his education he worked in various universities in US and Canada. Before joining UC Irvine in 2017, he was professorial fellow at the Centre of Contemporary Studies, [[Nehru Memorial Museum and Library]], [[New Delhi]] and was visiting professor of [[political science]] at [[York University, Toronto]].  He also works as an editorial consultant with the [[India]]n newsmagazine ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' and as a senior news analyst for the Indian website [[Newsclick]].\n\n==Work==\n\nIn his book ''In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures'', Ahmad primarily discusses the role of theory and theorists in the movement against colonialism and imperialism. Ahmad's argument against those who uphold poststructuralism and postmodernist conceptions of material history revolves around the fact that very little has been accomplished since the advent of this brand of postcolonial inquiry. The book contains an especially polemical critique of [[Frederic Jameson]]'s argument in \"Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism\" where Ahmad attacks Jameson on the grounds that Jameson's argument is insufficiently theorized in its use of terms like \"Third World\" which appears to be defined purely in terms of its experience of colonialism. This in turn leads Jameson to make hasty and untenable generalizations about how all \"third world literature\" would necessarily function as a national allegory that according to Jameson works as resistance to a system of global postmodernism.\n\nAhmad in his book expresses his chagrin at how his critique of Jameson has been appropriated by Postcolonial scholars as an attack on Marxism, while Ahmad contends that he takes issue with Jameson simply because his use of Marxism in the essay on Third World Literature is not rigorous enough. \nThe book also contains a lengthy critique of Edward Said's Orientalism which Ahmad argues reproduces the very Liberal Humanist tradition that it seeks to undermine in its selection of Western canonized texts that are critiqued for their Orientalism, as this upholds the idea that Western culture is represented in its entirety through those very texts. Furthermore, Ahmad asserts that by tracing Orientalist thought all the way back to Ancient Greece it becomes unclear in Said's work whether Orientalism is a product of Colonialism, or whether Colonialism is, in fact, a product of Orientalism.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n#[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr89RWtWDjoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false ''In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures''] - Verso, 1992. \n# ''A World To Win: Essays on the Communist Manifesto'' - with [[Irfan Habib]] & [[Prabhat Patnaik]], LeftWord Books, 1999. \n#[https://books.google.com/books?id=r3rAQDUm898C&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=Lineages+of+the+Present:+Ideological+and+Political+Genealogies+of+Contemporary+South+Asia&source=bl&ots=b9ZLtNGwSU&sig=Jdp-TlwEFjWw_--8tMlqMrzv_sc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz55Pw9PXXAhUFOI8KHUVzArIQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Lineages of the Present:  Ideological and Political Genealogies of Contemporary South Asia''] - Verso, 2001. \n#''[http://www.threeessays.com/books/on-communalism-and-globalization/ On Communalism and Globalization: Offensives of the Far Right]'' - Three Essays Collective, New Delhi, 2002. \n#''Iraq, Afghanistan and the Imperialism of Our Time'' - [[LeftWord Books]], New Delhi, 2004. \n#''In Our Time: Empire, Politics, Culture'' - Verso, 2007\n\n'''Edited'''\n# ''Ghazals of Ghalib'' - ed. by Aijaz Ahmad.
