Over six decades later, Central Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThe building was designed by architecture firms [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n[[File:First Presbyterian Church of Montclair, 1856.png|alt=Central Presbyterian Church, Montclair, NJ|thumb|Central Presbyterian Church, 1856]]\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary:  Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F. Elizabeth Harris:  Dry Creek, West Virginia\n\nRev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore:  Mainpuri, India\n\nRev. Giacinto J. Reale, Italian Mission:  Montclair, New Jersey\n\n\n''Members engaged in mission work:''\n\nRev. Thomas F. Carter:  Nanhsuchou, China\n\nDr. Edward Mills Dodd:  Tabriz, Persia\n\nPeter Carter Speers:  Lahore, India\n\nJohn L. Mott:  Nagpur, India\n\nJames L. Speers, Jr.:  Nanking, China\n\nDr. and Mrs. William S. Dodd:  Konia, Turkey\n\nMarjorie C. Geary:  Czechoslovakia\n\nDr. Wilson Farnsworth Dodd:  Constantinople, Turkey\n\nMarian Crawford:  Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall:  Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2014, Reverend David C.

Central Presbyterian Church was then added to the National Register of Historic Places in Carr\u00e8re.\n\nThe building was designed by architecture firms [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n[[File:First Presbyterian Church of Montclair, 1856.png|alt=Central Presbyterian Church, Montclair, NJ|thumb|Central Presbyterian Church, 1856]]\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary:  Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F. Elizabeth Harris:  Dry Creek, West Virginia\n\nRev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore:  Mainpuri, India\n\nRev. Giacinto J. Reale, Italian Mission:  Montclair, New Jersey\n\n\n''Members engaged in mission work:''\n\nRev. Thomas F. Carter:  Nanhsuchou, China\n\nDr. Edward Mills Dodd:  Tabriz, Persia\n\nPeter Carter Speers:  Lahore, India\n\nJohn L. Mott:  Nagpur, India\n\nJames L. Speers, Jr.:  Nanking, China\n\nDr. and Mrs. William S. Dodd:  Konia, Turkey\n\nMarjorie C. Geary:  Czechoslovakia\n\nDr. Wilson Farnsworth Dodd:  Constantinople, Turkey\n\nMarian Crawford:  Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall:  Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2014, Reverend David C. Noble became the church's senior pastor, and currently serves in this position.\n<br />\n\n= Central Presbyterian Church Pastors & Dates of Service \u00a0 =\n'''Called Pastors:'''\n\n1839 - 1843:  Rev.

Cyanide is quickly metabolized to 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid and [[thiocyanate]] with a [[half life]] of 10\u201330 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism.  Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys.  Thiocyanate possesses ~0.01% the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLactate concentrations above 10&nbsp;mmol per liter are an indicator of cyanide poisoning, as defined by the presence of a blood cyanide concentration above 40 mumol per liter. Lactate levels greater than 6&nbsp;mmol/L after reported or strongly suspected pure cyanide poisoning, such as cyanide-containing smoke exposure, suggests significant cyanide exposure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leybell |first1=Inna |title=Cyanide Toxicity Workup |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-workup |website=Medscape |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMethods of detection include colorimetric assays such as the [[Prussian blue (medical use)|Prussian blue]] test, the pyridine-barbiturate assay, also known as the \"Conway diffusion method\"<ref>Forensic Toxicology: Principles and Concepts By Nicholas T Lappas, Courtney M Lappas, Chapter 10.</ref> and the taurine fluorescence-HPLC but like all colorimetric assays these are prone to false positives.  Lipid peroxidation resulting in \"[[TBARS]],\" an artifact of heart attack produces dialdehydes that cross-react with the pyridine-barbiturate assay.  Meanwhile, the taurine-fluorescence-HPLC assay used for cyanide detection is identical to the assay used to detect glutathione in spinal fluid.\n\nCyanide and thiocyanate assays have been run with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which are considered specific tests. Since cyanide has a short half-life, the main metabolite, thiocyanate is typically measured to determine exposure.

However, this reaction occurs too slowly in the body for thiosulfate to be adequate by itself in acute cyanide poisoning. Thiosulfate must therefore be used in combination with nitrites.<ref name=\"emedicine.medscape.com\"/>\n|-cyanide can be found on a silver back lizard frog from the village called Bodelwyddan in the north of Wales.\n| [[Hydroxocobalamin]]\n|[[Hydroxocobalamin]], a form (or [[vitamer]]) of [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] made by bacteria, and sometimes denoted vitamin B<sub>12a</sub>, is used to bind cyanide to form the harmless [[cyanocobalamin]] form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. \n|-\n| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]]\n| [[4-Dimethylaminophenol]] (4-DMAP) has been proposed{{By whom|date=May 2010}} in Germany as a more rapid antidote than nitrites with (reportedly) lower toxicity.  4-DMAP is used currently by the German military and by the civilian population.  In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).\n|-\n| [[Dicobalt edetate]]\n| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnosis of cyanide poisoning. Because of its side effects, it should be reserved only for patients with the most severe degree of exposure to cyanide; otherwise, nitrite/thiosulfate is preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=209160 |name-list-format=vanc|year=1978 |last1=Nagler |first1=J |last2=Provoost |first2=RA |last3=Parizel |first3=G |title=Hydrogen cyanide poisoning: Treatment with cobalt EDTA |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=414\u20136 |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Glucose]]\n| Evidence from animal experiments suggests that coadministration of [[glucose]] protects against cobalt toxicity associated with the antidote agent dicobalt edetate.  For this reason, glucose is often administered alongside this agent (e.g. in the formulation 'Kelocyanor').<BR>It has also been anecdotally suggested that glucose is itself an effective counteragent to cyanide, reacting with it to form less toxic compounds that can be eliminated by the body. One theory on the apparent immunity of [[Grigori Rasputin]] to cyanide was that his killers put the poison in sweet pastries and [[madeira wine]], both of which are rich in sugar; thus, Rasputin would have been administered the poison together with massive quantities of antidote.

Cyanide is quickly metabolized to 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid and [[thiocyanate]] with a [[half life]] of 10\u201330 minutes as a detoxifying mechanism.  Within a few hours of single ingestion, no cyanide can be detected, since all of it is metabolized unless death occurs first. Thiocyanate has a long half life of >24hrs, and is typically eliminated through the kidneys.  Thiocyanate possesses ~0.01% the toxicity of the cyanide parent molecule.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLactate concentrations above 10&nbsp;mmol per liter are an indicator of cyanide poisoning, as defined by the presence of a blood cyanide concentration above 40 mumol per liter. Lactate levels greater than 6&nbsp;mmol/L after reported or strongly suspected pure cyanide poisoning, such as cyanide-containing smoke exposure, suggests significant cyanide exposure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leybell |first1=Inna |title=Cyanide Toxicity Workup |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-workup |website=Medscape |accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nMethods of detection include colorimetric assays such as the [[Prussian blue (medical use)|Prussian blue]] test, the pyridine-barbiturate assay, also known as the \"Conway diffusion method\"<ref>Forensic Toxicology: Principles and Concepts By Nicholas T Lappas, Courtney M Lappas, Chapter 10.</ref> and the taurine fluorescence-HPLC but like all colorimetric assays these are prone to false positives.  Lipid peroxidation resulting in \"[[TBARS]],\" an artifact of heart attack produces dialdehydes that cross-react with the pyridine-barbiturate assay.  Meanwhile, the taurine-fluorescence-HPLC assay used for cyanide detection is identical to the assay used to detect glutathione in spinal fluid.\n\nCyanide and thiocyanate assays have been run with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which are considered specific tests. Since cyanide has a short half-life, the main metabolite, thiocyanate is typically measured to determine exposure.

In humans, intravenous injection of 3&nbsp;mg/kg of 4-DMAP produces 35 percent methemoglobin levels within 1 minute.  Reportedly, 4-DMAP is part of the US Cyanokit, while it is not part of the German Cyanokit due to side effects (e. g. [[hemolysis]]).\n|-\n| [[Dicobalt edetate]]\n| [[Cobalt]] ions, being chemically similar to iron ions, can also bind cyanide.  One current cobalt-based antidote available in Europe is [[dicobalt edetate]] or dicobalt-EDTA, sold as Kelocyanor. This agent chelates cyanide as the cobalticyanide.  This drug provides an antidote effect more quickly than formation of methemoglobin, but a clear superiority to methemoglobin formation has not been demonstrated. Cobalt [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are quite toxic, and there have been accidents reported in the UK where patients have been given dicobalt-EDTA by mistake based on a false diagnosis of cyanide poisoning. Because of its side effects, it should be reserved only for patients with the most severe degree of exposure to cyanide; otherwise, nitrite/thiosulfate is preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=209160 |name-list-format=vanc|year=1978 |last1=Nagler |first1=J |last2=Provoost |first2=RA |last3=Parizel |first3=G |title=Hydrogen cyanide poisoning: Treatment with cobalt EDTA |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=414\u20136 |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Glucose]]\n| Evidence from animal experiments suggests that coadministration of [[glucose]] protects against cobalt toxicity associated with the antidote agent dicobalt edetate.

Cyanide reacts at a higher level with high stomach [[acidity]].\n\n*On 26 January 1904, company promoter and swindler [[Whitaker Wright]] committed suicide by ingesting cyanide in a court anteroom immediately after being convicted of fraud.\n* In February 1937, the Uruguayan short story writer [[Horacio Quiroga]] committed suicide by drinking cyanide in a hospital at [[Buenos Aires]].\n* In 1937, polymer chemist [[Wallace Carothers]] committed suicide by cyanide.\n* In the 1943 [[Operation Gunnerside]] to destroy the Vemork Heavy Water Plant in World War II (an attempt to stop or slow German atomic bomb progress), the commandos were given cyanide tablets (cyanide enclosed in rubber) kept in the mouth and were instructed to bite into them in case of German capture. The tablets ensured death within three minutes.<ref>\"Operation Gunnerside\" in the book ''Bomb: The Race to Build&nbsp;\u2013 and Steal&nbsp;\u2013 the World's Most Dangerous Weapon''</ref>\n* Cyanide, in the form of pure liquid [[prussic acid]] (a historical name for hydrogen cyanide), was the favored [[suicide agent]] of the [[Third Reich]]. It was used to commit suicide by [[Erwin Rommel]] (1944), [[Adolf Hitler]]'s wife, [[Eva Braun]] (1945), and by Nazi leaders [[Heinrich Himmler]] (1945), possibly [[Martin Bormann]] (1945), and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] (1946).\n* It is speculated that, in 1954, [[Alan Turing]] used an apple that had been injected with a solution of cyanide to commit suicide after being convicted of having a homosexual relationship\u2014illegal at the time in the UK\u2014and forced to undergo hormonal castration.\n* Members of the Sri Lankan [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] ([[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], whose [[LTTE Insurgency|insurgency]] lasted from 1983 to 2009), used to wear cyanide vials around their necks with the intention of committing suicide if captured by the government forces.\n*On 18 November 1978, [[Jonestown]].

{"title_page": "Massacre of the Innocents (Bruegel)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Massacre of the Innocents - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|Version in the [[Royal Collection]]]]\n\nSeveral oil-on-oak-panel versions of '''''The Massacre of the Innocents''''' were painted by 16th-century Netherlandish painters [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and his son [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]]. The work translates the Biblical account of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] into a winter scene in the [[Netherlands]] in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the [[Eighty Years' War]].\n\nWhat is now thought to be the only version by Bruegel the Elder (c.1565-1567) is in the British [[Royal Collection]]; for some time held at [[Hampton Court Palace]], by 2017 it was at [[Windsor Castle]].  Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] ordered it [[overpainting|overpainted]] to hide images of dead and dying children. Many other versions are attributed to Pieter Breughel the Younger, with different art historians listing as many as 7 or 14 versions, including leading examples in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna (the only version showing the slaughter), in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in Brussels, and in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] in Bucharest.  Pieter Breughel the Younger also painted his own different composition of the Massacre of the Innocents: one example is held by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.\n\n==Background==\nThe painting depicts an event described in the [[Gospel of Saint Matthew]] 2:16-18 in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]]: after [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] was told by the [[Magi]] of the birth of [[Jesus]] in [[Bethlehem]], he ordered his soldiers to kill all of the infant children in Bethlehem below the age of 2 years.  (In the Biblical account, an angel warned Jesus's family, and they [[flight to Egypt|escaped to Egypt]].)  The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] is commemorated on 28 December in the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican church calendars, as the fourth day of [[Christmastide]]. \n\nBruegel translated the scene to a 16th-century [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlandish]] village, where the [[Flanders|Flemish]] villagers are attacked by Spanish soldiers and German mercenaries, possibly as a commentary on the behaviour of occupying Spanish troops in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the  [[Eighty Years' War]].  The very severe winter of 1564-65 may have inspired the snow-covered scene, with icicles hanging from the eaves and a pond covered with a thick layer of ice: the deep winter also inspired his 1565 painting ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]''.\n\n==Versions==\nThe version by Bruegel the Elder in the [[Royal Collection]] was acquired by Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II and was in Prague by about 1600. Rudolph disliked the graphic scene, which depicted many infants being slaughtered by soldiers carrying his own imperial heraldry of the double-headed eagle, and had the children painted over with details \u2013 small objects including food and animals \u2013 so that it became a scene of plunder not a massacre of babies.  The later overpainting became apparent during conservation work in 1998, and [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] identified the painting in the Royal Collection as the original version by Bruegel the Elder. This version was probably one of many paintings from the imperial collection looted from [[Prague Castle]] by a [[Battle of Prague (1648)|Swedish army in 1648]], at the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]: it was in the collection of [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina]] by 1652, and came into the British Royal Collection when it was acquired by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in exile at [[Breda]] in 1660.  It is signed \"BRVEGEL\"  1565\u201367, and measures {{convert|102|xx|155|cm}}.\n\nThe version at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna was long thought to be the original by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It was in the [[Neue Burg]] in the early 17th century, and given to the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]] in 1748. It is now thought to be a copy by his son, Pieter Breughel the Younger, or his studio. As it has not been overpainted, it shows the original details of the massacre; this is also the case with the other early versions. It is signed \"BRVEG\". A version signed by Breughel the Younger and dated 1593, one of his earliest known paintings, is held by the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in [[Lons-le-Saunier]].\n\nAnother copy signed \".BRVEGEL. 15..\" was in Sweden, and then in the [[Hermitage Museum]], before [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|being sold by the early Soviet government]]. It was sold in Paris in 1979, at [[Sotheby's]] in 2005, and then at [[Christie's]] in 2012 for \u00a31.8m, as by Pieter Breughel the Younger.  A further version at the [[Brukenthal Museum]] in Sibiu, Romania is signed 'P. BRVEGEL'. A version sold at Sotheby's in 2009, with provenance in Belgium and the Netherlands, also attributed to Pieter Breughel the Younger, was sold for \u00a34.6m.\n\n==Description ==\n[[File:Kindermord (Pieter Brueghel d. J.).jpg|thumb|250px|Version in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]], long regarded as the original.]]\nLike several of Bruegel's paintings, such as the ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' and ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', the painting includes many parallel narrative scenes in a larger composition.  Working from the church in the background towards the foreground: a mounted soldier with a lance guards a bridge.  To the left, a man tries to hide a child.  Moving forward and further towards the left, one soldier urinates against a wall; and further left, another soldier guides some women into a house, and a third soldier drags an infant out of another house (one of few infants remaining alive in the painting, and one of few not overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection).  A group of four villagers mourns nearby.  \n\nMoving right, towards the centre of the painting, a lone woman stands grieving over her dead baby lying with blood spilled on the snow (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection with meats and cheeses), and a couple ask a soldier to take their daughter not their baby son (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection as a large bird).  A crowd of villagers surround and confront a red-coated soldier standing over a dead baby (overpainted as a bundle); or, the villagers try to stop a father from attacking the soldier that killed his baby. A seated woman grieves with her dead baby on her lap (changed to a bundle).\n\nContinuing to the right, at the centre of the painting, a group of Spanish soldiers in black armour stab with spears at a group of babies (changed to animals) in front of a large group of mounted soldiers also with lances and wearing black armour.  One of the mounted soldiers may be holding a standard of five gold crosses on a white ground, the heraldic [[Jerusalem cross|arms of Jerusalem]].  A soldier with striped breeches stabs one child (overpainted as a boar) and another stabs at a baby held by a woman (overpainted as a jug).  Further to the right, a single mounted man is surrounded by a group of protesting villagers: originally he was a herald wearing a tabard decorated with a [[Habsburg]] [[double-headed eagle]].\n\nAt the far right, two mounted soldiers wear red jackets and rounded metal helmets.  Some soldiers on foot are breaking into an inn: the inn sign originally showed a star linking it with the [[Star of Bethlehem]] (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection).  One soldier wields an axe and another has a log to use as a [[battering ram]]; three are climbing into an open window, and one with a halberd kicks at a door, shaking off an overhanging icicle which threatens to fall on his head. Moving across the foreground, right to left, a baby (changed to a bundle) has been torn from a mother and her small daughter; a soldier holds back a large dog; and further the left, in the immediate foreground, a soldier is about to stab a child (overpainted as a calf).

The work translates the Biblical account of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] into a winter scene in the [[Netherlands]] in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the [[Eighty Years' War]].\n\nWhat is now thought to be the only version by Bruegel the Elder (c.1565-1567) is in the British [[Royal Collection]]; for some time held at [[Hampton Court Palace]], by 2017 it was at [[Windsor Castle]].  Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] ordered it [[overpainting|overpainted]] to hide images of dead and dying children. Many other versions are attributed to Pieter Breughel the Younger, with different art historians listing as many as 7 or 14 versions, including leading examples in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna (the only version showing the slaughter), in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in Brussels, and in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] in Bucharest.  Pieter Breughel the Younger also painted his own different composition of the Massacre of the Innocents: one example is held by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.\n\n==Background==\nThe painting depicts an event described in the [[Gospel of Saint Matthew]] 2:16-18 in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]]: after [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] was told by the [[Magi]] of the birth of [[Jesus]] in [[Bethlehem]], he ordered his soldiers to kill all of the infant children in Bethlehem below the age of 2 years.  (In the Biblical account, an angel warned Jesus's family, and they [[flight to Egypt|escaped to Egypt]].)  The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] is commemorated on 28 December in the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican church calendars, as the fourth day of [[Christmastide]]. \n\nBruegel translated the scene to a 16th-century [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlandish]] village, where the [[Flanders|Flemish]] villagers are attacked by Spanish soldiers and German mercenaries, possibly as a commentary on the behaviour of occupying Spanish troops in the prelude to the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, also known as the  [[Eighty Years' War]].  The very severe winter of 1564-65 may have inspired the snow-covered scene, with icicles hanging from the eaves and a pond covered with a thick layer of ice: the deep winter also inspired his 1565 painting ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]''.\n\n==Versions==\nThe version by Bruegel the Elder in the [[Royal Collection]] was acquired by Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II and was in Prague by about 1600. Rudolph disliked the graphic scene, which depicted many infants being slaughtered by soldiers carrying his own imperial heraldry of the double-headed eagle, and had the children painted over with details \u2013 small objects including food and animals \u2013 so that it became a scene of plunder not a massacre of babies.  The later overpainting became apparent during conservation work in 1998, and [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] identified the painting in the Royal Collection as the original version by Bruegel the Elder. This version was probably one of many paintings from the imperial collection looted from [[Prague Castle]] by a [[Battle of Prague (1648)|Swedish army in 1648]], at the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]: it was in the collection of [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina]] by 1652, and came into the British Royal Collection when it was acquired by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in exile at [[Breda]] in 1660.  It is signed \"BRVEGEL\"  1565\u201367, and measures {{convert|102|xx|155|cm}}.\n\nThe version at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna was long thought to be the original by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It was in the [[Neue Burg]] in the early 17th century, and given to the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]] in 1748. It is now thought to be a copy by his son, Pieter Breughel the Younger, or his studio. As it has not been overpainted, it shows the original details of the massacre; this is also the case with the other early versions. It is signed \"BRVEG\". A version signed by Breughel the Younger and dated 1593, one of his earliest known paintings, is held by the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in [[Lons-le-Saunier]].\n\nAnother copy signed \".BRVEGEL. 15..\" was in Sweden, and then in the [[Hermitage Museum]], before [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|being sold by the early Soviet government]]. It was sold in Paris in 1979, at [[Sotheby's]] in 2005, and then at [[Christie's]] in 2012 for \u00a31.8m, as by Pieter Breughel the Younger.  A further version at the [[Brukenthal Museum]] in Sibiu, Romania is signed 'P. BRVEGEL'. A version sold at Sotheby's in 2009, with provenance in Belgium and the Netherlands, also attributed to Pieter Breughel the Younger, was sold for \u00a34.6m.\n\n==Description ==\n[[File:Kindermord (Pieter Brueghel d. J.).jpg|thumb|250px|Version in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]], long regarded as the original.]]\nLike several of Bruegel's paintings, such as the ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' and ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', the painting includes many parallel narrative scenes in a larger composition.  Working from the church in the background towards the foreground: a mounted soldier with a lance guards a bridge.  To the left, a man tries to hide a child.  Moving forward and further towards the left, one soldier urinates against a wall; and further left, another soldier guides some women into a house, and a third soldier drags an infant out of another house (one of few infants remaining alive in the painting, and one of few not overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection).  A group of four villagers mourns nearby.  \n\nMoving right, towards the centre of the painting, a lone woman stands grieving over her dead baby lying with blood spilled on the snow (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection with meats and cheeses), and a couple ask a soldier to take their daughter not their baby son (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection as a large bird).  A crowd of villagers surround and confront a red-coated soldier standing over a dead baby (overpainted as a bundle); or, the villagers try to stop a father from attacking the soldier that just killed his baby. A seated woman grieves with her dead baby on her lap (changed to a bundle).\n\nContinuing to the right, at the centre of the painting, a group of Spanish soldiers in black armour stab with spears at a group of babies (changed to animals) in front of a large group of mounted soldiers also with lances and wearing black armour.  One of the mounted soldiers may be holding a standard of five gold crosses on a white ground, the heraldic [[Jerusalem cross|arms of Jerusalem]].  A soldier with striped breeches stabs one child (overpainted as a boar) and another stabs at a baby held by a woman (overpainted as a jug).  Further to the right, a single mounted man is surrounded by a group of protesting villagers: originally he was a herald wearing a tabard decorated with a [[Habsburg]] [[double-headed eagle]].\n\nAt the far right, two mounted soldiers wear red jackets and rounded metal helmets.  Some soldiers on foot are breaking into an inn: the inn sign originally showed a star linking it with the [[Star of Bethlehem]] (overpainted in the version in the Royal Collection).  One soldier wields an axe and another has a log to use as a [[battering ram]]; three are climbing into an open window, and one with a halberd kicks at a door, shaking off an overhanging icicle which threatens to fall on his head. Moving across the foreground, right to left, a baby (changed to a bundle) has been torn from a mother and her small daughter; a soldier holds back a large dog; and further the left, in the immediate foreground, a soldier is about to stab a child (overpainted as a calf).  At the far left, another soldier chases after a woman.\n\nA group of mounted soldiers stands in the left foreground, two in black armour with lances, a trumpeter in a yellow jacket, and three with red jackets.  One may be intended to be the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], the notoriously harsh commander of the Spanish army in the Netherlands: the resemblance becomes clearer in the later paintings by Brueghel the Younger. \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\n\nFile:P.

Lichtenfeld became active in a wide range of sports, including gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing. In 1928, Lichtenfeld won the Slovak Youth Wrestling Championship, and in 1929 the adult championship (light and middle weight divisions).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.krav-maga.net/en/bio-imi-lichtenfeld|title=Bio Imi Lichtenfeld {{!}} F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Europ\u00e9enne de Krav-maga|website=www.krav-maga.net|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> That same year, he also won the national boxing championship and an international gymnastics championship. During the ensuing decade, Lichtenfeld athletic activities focused mainly on wrestling, both as a contestant and a trainer.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, [[anti-Semitic]] riots began to threaten the Jews of [[Bratislava]], Czechoslovakia. Lichtenfeld became the leader of a group of Jewish boxers and wrestlers who took to the streets to defend Jewish neighborhoods against the growing numbers of anti-Semitic national socialists. Lichtenfeld quickly discovered, however, that actual fighting was very different from competition fighting, and although boxing and wrestling were good sports, they were not always practical for the aggressive and brutal nature of street combat. It was then that he started to re-evaluate his ideas about fighting and started developing the skills and techniques that would eventually become Krav Maga. Having become a thorn in the side of the equally anti-Semitic local authorities, in 1940 Lichtenfeld left his home with his family and friends on the last refugee ship to escape Europe.\n\n[[File:Team Minot 'kicks' up their techniques 121007-F-RB551-106.jpg|thumb|US Air Force Security forces members during Krav Maga training.]]\nAfter making his way to [[Mandatory Palestine]], Lichtenfeld joined the [[Haganah]] paramilitary organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kravmaga.com.br/languages/eua/?id=o-criador|title=Krav Maga|last=Martins|first=Victor Figueiredo, Jo\u00e3o Carlos, Marcelo|website=www.kravmaga.com.br|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129094314/http://www.kravmaga.com.br/languages/eua/?id=o-criador|archive-date=January 29, 2019|url-status=dead|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> In 1944 Lichtenfeld began training fighters in his areas of expertise: physical fitness, swimming, wrestling, use of the knife, and defense against knife attacks. During this period, Lichtenfeld trained several elite units of the Haganah including [[Palmach]] (striking force of the Haganah and forerunner of the special units of the Israel Defense Forces) and the [[Pal-Yam]], as well as groups of police officers.\n\nIn 1948, when the [[State of Israel]] was founded and the IDF was formed, Lichtenfeld became Chief Instructor for Physical Fitness and Krav Maga at the IDF School of Combat Fitness. He served in the IDF for about 20 years, during which time he developed and refined his unique method for self-defense and hand-to-hand combat. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kravmagatoronto.com/imi-lichtenfeld/|title=Krav Maga Toronto {{!}} Imi Lichtenfeld, Founder of Krav Maga|work=Krav Maga Toronto|access-date=25 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709184916/https://kravmagatoronto.com/imi-lichtenfeld/|archive-date=July 9, 2018|url-status=dead|language=en-US}}</ref> Self-defense was not a new concept, since nearly all martial arts had developed some form of defensive techniques in their quest for tournament or sport dominance.  However, self-defense was based strictly upon the scientific and dynamic principles of the human body. In 1965 judo training was added as part of the Krav Maga training, and until 1968 there were no grades in Krav Maga. Then a trainee's grades were determined largely by his knowledge in [[judo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://krav-maga.wincol.ac.il/?page_id=1910 |title=Eli Avikzar |website=krav-maga.wincol.ac.il/}}</ref><ref name=\"traditionalkravmaga_154\">{{Cite news|url=http://traditionalkravmaga.com/page154.html |title= Eli Avikzar |website=traditionalkravmaga.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Eli Avikzar]], Lichtenfeld principal student and first black belt<ref name=\"what-is-k-a-m-i\">{{cite web|url=https://kravmagen.ca/what-is-k-a-m-i/ |title=What is K.A.M.I? |website=kravmagen.ca}}</ref>, began learning [[aikido]] and in 1971 left for France where he received a black belt in aikido.<ref name=\"urlThe Krav Maga Expert - Mental Training to become Pure Krav Maga and Hand-to ... - Boaz Aviram - Google Books\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=8gjBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Krav+Maga+aikido+wrestling++judo&source=bl&ots=qvVl6RnUjF&sig=ACfU3U1uvvGeCKH_XahtgINYpNfo6PKSng&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHlO7ss-PoAhXBwsQBHVa8DosQ6AEwD3oECDcQKQ#v=onepage&q=Krav%20Maga%20aikido%20wrestling%20%20judo&f=false |title=The Krav Maga Expert - Mental Training to become Pure Krav Maga and Hand-to ... - Boaz Aviram - Google Books |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Upon his return, Avikzar started working alongside Imi to integrated more traditional martial arts into krav maga and as an instructor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kravmagen.ca/founder-of-israeli-martial-arts/ |title=About the Founder ELI AVIKZAR |website=kravmagen.ca}}</ref>  Then in 1974 Imre retired and gave Eli Avikzar control over the Krav Maga training center in Netanya.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krav-maga.ro/en/history-of-krav-maga |title=History of Krav-Maga |website=krav-maga.ro}}</ref> Shortly after, in 1976, Avikzar joined the permanent force of IDF, as head of the Krav Maga section.

It starts with white belt, and then yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and black belts. Black belt students can move up the ranks from 1st to 9th Dan. The time and requirements for advancing have some differences between the organizations.\n\nOther organizations that teach Krav Maga in and outside of Israel use similar grading systems.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://krav-maga.com/training-programs/grading-system\n |title       = Grading System\n |publisher   = krav-maga.com\n |accessdate  = 5 March 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130305005709/http://krav-maga.com/training-programs/grading-system\n |archivedate = 5 March 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nA patch system was developed by [[Eyal Yanilov]] in the late 1980s. The grades are divided into three main categories; Practitioner, Graduate and Expert. Each of the categories, which are often abbreviated to their initials, has five ranks. Grades P1 through to P5 are the student levels and make up the majority of the Krav Maga community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kravmagaglobalne.com/about-krav-maga|title=About Krav Maga|website=www.kravmagaglobalne.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> After P5 are G1-G5, and in order to achieve Graduate level the student has to demonstrate a proficiency in all of the P level techniques before advancing.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px\"\n|+ Belt colors and IKMF patches\n|-\n| style=\"width:60px;\"|White ||  style=\"width:80px; background:white;\"| [[File:Ceinture blanche.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P0 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture jaune.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P1 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga P2 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Orange || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture orange.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P3 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga P4 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Green || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture verte.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P5 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga G1 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Blue || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture bleue.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga G2 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga G3 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Brown || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture marron.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga G4 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga G5 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Black || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"5\" | [[File:Ceinture noire.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga E1 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E2 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E3 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E4 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E5 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nAlthough there are some subtle differences, the various organizations teach the same core techniques and principles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wav.bksites.net/|title=Home Page|website=W.A.V.|accessdate=30 July 2017}}</ref> Some other organizations have less formal grading ranks without belts or patches but do have levels by which students can monitor their progress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kravmaga-paris16.com/en/becoming-an-ois-instructor.html |title=Becoming An OIS Instructor |date= |accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sparring===\nIn some organizations sparring is slow and light until the student reaches G2 level. This takes approximately four to six years because rising one level in the Practitioner and Graduate categories takes at minimum half a year of consistent training.

They train full contact with minimal gear in both stand-up and ground fighting, using semi-professional [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] rules for safety. Sparring should always be supervised and monitored carefully by a qualified instructor.\n\n=== Competition for civilians ===\nSome Krav Maga organizations do not support a competition component, taking the stance that Krav Maga is not a sport. So-called \"fighting\" sports tend to operate under principles of using safe techniques, doing minimal harm, and consequently wearing down opponents and using other tactics supported by the \"rules\" of safe competition. In its role as self-defense and as a hand-to-hand combat system, Krav Maga operates under a completely different set of principles in which techniques may indeed cause significant damage and fights are to be ended as quickly as possible when the conflict cannot be avoided. Krav Maga organizations that involve competition are usually founded and named specifically to focus on using Krav Maga-based techniques specifically under a set of sporting principles.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Urban Krav Maga]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commonscat|Krav Maga}}\n==Further reading==\n* Imi Sde-Or (founder) and Eyal Yanilov (head instructor) ''How to Defend Yourself Against Armed Assault'', Dekel Publishing House, 2001. {{ISBN|1583940081}}\n* Aviram, Boaz.

Lichtenfeld became active in a wide range of sports, including gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing. In 1928, Lichtenfeld won the Slovak Youth Wrestling Championship, and in 1929 the adult championship (light and middle weight divisions).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.krav-maga.net/en/bio-imi-lichtenfeld|title=Bio Imi Lichtenfeld {{!}} F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Europ\u00e9enne de Krav-maga|website=www.krav-maga.net|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> That same year, he also won the national boxing championship and an international gymnastics championship. During the ensuing decade, Lichtenfeld athletic activities focused mainly on wrestling, both as a contestant and a trainer.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, [[anti-Semitic]] riots began to threaten the Jews of [[Bratislava]], Czechoslovakia. Lichtenfeld became the leader of a group of Jewish boxers and wrestlers who took to the streets to defend Jewish neighborhoods against the growing numbers of anti-Semitic national socialists. Lichtenfeld quickly discovered, however, that actual fighting was very different from competition fighting, and although boxing and wrestling were good sports, they were not always practical for the aggressive and brutal nature of street combat. It was then that he started to re-evaluate his ideas about fighting and started developing the skills and techniques that would eventually become Krav Maga. Having become a thorn in the side of the equally anti-Semitic local authorities, in 1940 Lichtenfeld left his home with his family and friends on the last refugee ship to escape Europe.\n\n[[File:Team Minot 'kicks' up their techniques 121007-F-RB551-106.jpg|thumb|US Air Force Security forces members during Krav Maga training.]]\nAfter making his way to [[Mandatory Palestine]], Lichtenfeld joined the [[Haganah]] paramilitary organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kravmaga.com.br/languages/eua/?id=o-criador|title=Krav Maga|last=Martins|first=Victor Figueiredo, Jo\u00e3o Carlos, Marcelo|website=www.kravmaga.com.br|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129094314/http://www.kravmaga.com.br/languages/eua/?id=o-criador|archive-date=January 29, 2019|url-status=dead|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> In 1944 Lichtenfeld began training fighters in his areas of expertise: physical fitness, swimming, wrestling, use of the knife, and defense against knife attacks. During this period, Lichtenfeld trained several elite units of the Haganah including [[Palmach]] (striking force of the Haganah and forerunner of the special units of the Israel Defense Forces) and the [[Pal-Yam]], as well as groups of police officers.\n\nIn 1948, when the [[State of Israel]] was founded and the IDF was formed, Lichtenfeld became Chief Instructor for Physical Fitness and Krav Maga at the IDF School of Combat Fitness. He served in the IDF for about 20 years, during which time he developed and refined his unique method for self-defense and hand-to-hand combat. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kravmagatoronto.com/imi-lichtenfeld/|title=Krav Maga Toronto {{!}} Imi Lichtenfeld, Founder of Krav Maga|work=Krav Maga Toronto|access-date=25 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709184916/https://kravmagatoronto.com/imi-lichtenfeld/|archive-date=July 9, 2018|url-status=dead|language=en-US}}</ref> Self-defense was not a new concept, since nearly all martial arts had developed some form of defensive techniques in their quest for tournament or sport dominance.  However, self-defense was based strictly upon the scientific and dynamic principles of the human body. In 1965 judo training was added as part of the Krav Maga training, and until 1968 there were no grades in Krav Maga. Then a trainee's grades were determined largely by his knowledge in [[judo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://krav-maga.wincol.ac.il/?page_id=1910}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://traditionalkravmaga.com/page154.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Eli Avikzar]], Lichtenfeld principal student and first black belt<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kravmagen.ca/what-is-k-a-m-i/}}</ref>, began learning [[aikido]] and in 1971 left for France where he received a black belt in aikido.<ref name=\"urlThe Krav Maga Expert - Mental Training to become Pure Krav Maga and Hand-to ... - Boaz Aviram - Google Books\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=8gjBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Krav+Maga+aikido+wrestling++judo&source=bl&ots=qvVl6RnUjF&sig=ACfU3U1uvvGeCKH_XahtgINYpNfo6PKSng&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHlO7ss-PoAhXBwsQBHVa8DosQ6AEwD3oECDcQKQ#v=onepage&q=Krav%20Maga%20aikido%20wrestling%20%20judo&f=false |title=The Krav Maga Expert - Mental Training to become Pure Krav Maga and Hand-to ... - Boaz Aviram - Google Books |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Upon his return, Avikzar started working alongside Imi to integrated more traditional martial arts into krav maga and as an instructor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kravmagen.ca/founder-of-israeli-martial-arts/}}</ref>  Then in 1974 Imre retired and gave Eli Avikzar control over the Krav Maga training center in Netanya.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krav-maga.ro/en/history-of-krav-maga}}</ref> Shortly after, in 1976, Avikzar joined the permanent force of IDF, as head of the Krav Maga section.

It starts with white belt, and then yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and black belts. Black belt students can move up the ranks from 1st to 9th Dan. The time and requirements for advancing have some differences between the organizations.\n\nOther organizations that teach Krav Maga in and outside of Israel use similar grading systems.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://krav-maga.com/training-programs/grading-system\n |title       = Grading System\n |publisher   = krav-maga.com\n |accessdate  = 5 March 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130305005709/http://krav-maga.com/training-programs/grading-system\n |archivedate = 5 March 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nA patch system was developed by [[Eyal Yanilov]] in the late 1980s. The grades are divided into three main categories; Practitioner, Graduate and Expert. Each of the categories, which are often abbreviated to their initials, has five ranks. Grades P1 through to P5 are the student levels and make up the majority of the Krav Maga community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kravmagaglobalne.com/about-krav-maga|title=About Krav Maga|website=www.kravmagaglobalne.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> After P5 are G1-G5, and in order to achieve Graduate level the student has to demonstrate a proficiency in all of the P level techniques before advancing.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px\"\n|+ Belt colors and IKMF patches\n|-\n| style=\"width:60px;\"|White ||  style=\"width:80px; background:white;\"| [[File:Ceinture blanche.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P0 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture jaune.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P1 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga P2 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Orange || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture orange.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P3 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga P4 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Green || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture verte.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga P5 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga G1 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Blue || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture bleue.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga G2 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga G3 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Brown || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[File:Ceinture marron.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga G4 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga G5 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Black || style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=\"5\" | [[File:Ceinture noire.png|55px]] || [[File:Krav Maga E1 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E2 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E3 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E4 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|| [[File:Krav Maga E5 Patch.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nAlthough there are some subtle differences, the various organizations teach the same core techniques and principles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wav.bksites.net/|title=Home Page|website=W.A.V.|accessdate=30 July 2017}}</ref> Some other organizations have less formal grading ranks without belts or patches but do have levels by which students can monitor their progress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kravmaga-paris16.com/en/becoming-an-ois-instructor.html |title=Becoming An OIS Instructor |date= |accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sparring===\nIn some organizations sparring is slow and light until the student reaches G2 level.

They train full contact with minimal gear in both stand-up and ground fighting, using semi-professional [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] rules for safety. Sparring should always be supervised and monitored carefully by a qualified instructor.\n\n=== Competition for civilians ===\nSome Krav Maga organizations do not support a competition component, taking the stance that Krav Maga is not a sport. So-called \"fighting\" sports tend to operate under principles of using safe techniques, doing minimal harm, and consequently wearing down opponents and using other tactics supported by the \"rules\" of safe competition. In its role as self-defense and as a hand-to-hand combat system, Krav Maga operates under a completely different set of principles in which techniques may indeed cause significant damage and fights are to be ended as quickly as possible when the conflict cannot be avoided. Krav Maga organizations that involve competition are usually founded and named specifically to focus on using Krav Maga-based techniques specifically under a set of sporting principles.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Urban Krav Maga]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commonscat|Krav Maga}}\n==Further reading==\n* Imi Sde-Or (founder) and Eyal Yanilov (head instructor) ''How to Defend Yourself Against Armed Assault'', Dekel Publishing House, 2001. {{ISBN|1583940081}}\n* Aviram, Boaz.

After the first world war many of the early clubs were never brought out of recess.\n\nOriginally Moturoa FC was a shortlived rugby club, started by the Breakwater Sports Committee in the kiosk at Ngamotu Beach in early 1914 before amalgamating with the Star club. Moturoa FC's home ground was the prison reserve field on Breakwater Road. The club retained one junior team that played in the club's colour, white, with a star emblem. \n\nNew Plymouth AFC was the first club to re-emerge in 1922 playing a well drilled Hawera at the who had played a few matches with teams from Wanganui along with the other resurgent South Taranaki clubs.\n\nThe Moturoa School opened in 1923 after years of deliberation.\n\nChina's Universities team toured New Zealand in 1924 and played a Taranaki team at Hawera.

The slender loris spends most of its life in trees (arboreal), traveling along the top of branches with slow and precise movements. It is found in [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[scrub forest]]s, semi-[[deciduous forest]]s, and [[swamp]]s. The species have lifespans of 15 years and are [[nocturnal]]. Slender lorises generally feed on insects, reptiles, shoots of plants, and fruits. \n\n\n==Name==\nThe [[Red slender loris |type species]] is named ''Lemur tardigradus''by [[Linnaeus]] (1758).\nThe classification of a separate genus ''Loris'' is due to [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1796).\n\n{{refimprove-section}}\nLocally, they are known as ''Devanga Pilli (\"\u0c26\u0c47\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c02\u0c17 \u0c2a\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\")'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''kaadu paapa'' (\"\u0c95\u0cbe\u0ca1\u0cc1 \u0caa\u0cbe\u0caa\") in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], ''kutti thevangu (\"\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\"  \"\u0d15\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d47\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\") \u0bb5\u0bbe(\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1) \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1(\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1)'' )in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]], and {{transl|si|unahapuluwa}} ({{lang|si|\u0d8b\u0db1\u0dc4\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf}}) in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], and \"Lajwanti\" (\u0932\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0924\u0940) in [[Marathi language|Marathi]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThere are two known species:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was adapted from [[Tom Wolfe]]'s best-selling [[The Right Stuff (book)|1979 book of the same name]] about the Navy, Marine and Air Force [[test pilot]]s who were involved in [[aeronautics|aeronautical research]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], as well as the [[Mercury Seven]], the seven military pilots who were selected to be the [[astronaut]]s for [[Project Mercury]], the first [[human spaceflight]] by the United States. The film was written and directed by [[Philip Kaufman]] and stars [[Ed Harris]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Barbara Hershey]]. [[Levon Helm]] narrates, and plays Air Force test pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]].\n\nThe film was a box-office failure, grossing about $21 million against a $27 million budget. Despite this, it received widespread critical acclaim and eight [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[56th Academy Awards]], four of which it won. It holds a ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' rating of 96%. In 2013 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"2013Add\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/library-of-congress-announces-2013-national-film-registry-selections/2013/12/17/eba98bce-6737-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html?tid=hpModule_ef3e52c4-8691-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394 \"Library of Congress announces 2013 National Film Registry selections\" (Press release).]  ''[[Washington Post]]'',  December 18, 2013.  Retrieved: December 18, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe film begins in 1947 at the [[Edwards Air Force Base|Muroc Army Air Field]] in California, with civilian and military [[test pilot]]s flight-testing high-speed aircraft, including the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]].  Death is a part of their life. After [[privateer]] [[Slick Goodlin]] demands $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1947|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to attempt to break the [[sound barrier]] in the X1, World War II hero Captain [[Chuck Yeager]] is given the chance. While horseback riding with his wife, Glennis, Yeager falls and breaks his ribs, an injury which inhibits his ability to lock the door on the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the secret mission, he confides in friend and fellow pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]], who solves the problem by giving Yeager the stump of a broom handle to use as leverage. Though the X1 bucks like a wild bronco, and pushes him to his limit, Yeager goes [[supersonic]] and becomes an international hero - a role he is uncomfortable in.\n\nSix years later, Muroc, by then Edwards Air Force Base, remains a beehive of danger, competition, and risky behavior. Major Yeager and friendly rival [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] repeatedly break each other's speed records. They often visit the [[Happy Bottom Riding Club]] run by pioneering aviatrix [[Pancho Barnes]] for raucous nights of drinking.  Loud and vulgar, she favors the pilots at Edwards who fly the best equipment, such as Yeager and Crossfield, whom she dubs \"prime\", over green \"pudknockers\" who only dream about it. Newly arrived [[United States Air Force]] captains [[Gordon Cooper|Gordon \"Gordo\" Cooper]], [[Gus Grissom|Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom]], and [[Deke Slayton|Donald \"Deke\" Slayton]] hope to prove that they have \"the Right Stuff\". Publicity has replaced secrecy to generate continued funding, adding further pressure to the pilots. Cooper's wife, Trudy, and other wives fear becoming widows as the ever more gripping competitions of man versus machine, man versus Nature, and man versus man grow, but cannot change their husbands' powerful ambitions and what they lead to.\n\nIn 1957, the launch of the Soviet [[Sputnik]] satellite [[Sputnik crisis|triggers a crisis]] for the United States government. Politicians such as Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and military leaders demand America wage and win an emerging [[Space Race]]. [[NASA]] is founded, and seeks to develop the first U.S. [[astronaut]]s.  In spite of his proven abilities Yeager is excluded because he lacks a college degree. Grueling physical and mental tests select an initial roster of gentlemen officers drawn from the U.S. Air Force and naval aviation.  These include [[Alan Shepard]], [[Wally Schirra]], [[Scott Carpenter]] of the [[United States Navy]], [[John Glenn]] from the [[United States Marine Corps]], and Cooper, Grissom and Slayton.  Dubbed the \"[[Mercury Seven]]\", the men immediately become national heroes. In spite of repeated launchpad and in-flight explosions of the booster rockets which will carry them, the ambitious competitors all hope to be the first in Space as part of [[Project Mercury]]. Early U.S. test flights include a [[Ham (chimpanzee)|chimpanzee]] to test [[G-force]]s and other loads upon animal life.  NASA engineers view the astronauts basically similarly, as mere passengers on pre-programmed flight paths. Insulted, the men insist that the Mercury spacecraft at least have a window, a hatch with explosive bolts, and [[pitch-yaw-roll]] controls to give them some role in its piloting. However, Russia beats them into Space on April 12, 1961 with the launch of [[Vostok 1]] carrying [[Yuri Gagarin]]. U.S. efforts redouble.\n\nShepard is the first American to reach space on the 15-minute sub-orbital flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 3]], on May 5, 1961. After Grissom's similar flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 4]] on July 21, the capsule's hatch blows open upon splashdown and quickly fills with water. Grissom escapes, but the spacecraft sinks. Many accuse him of opening the hatch prematurely and panicking, a personal smirch, not on the program. Glenn, boosted on [[Mercury-Atlas 6]], becomes the first American to orbit the Earth on February 20, 1962.  He survives a possibly loose heat shield and receives a [[ticker-tape parade]]. The entire Mercury Seven and their families become celebrities, and are feted at a gigantic celebration to announce the opening of the [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Space Center]] in [[Houston]].\n\nAlthough test pilots at Edwards mock the Mercury program for sending \"Spam in a can\" into Space, they recognize the courage it takes, irrespective of flying skill.  Yeager states that \"it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially when it's on national TV.\" While attempting to set a new altitude record at the edge of space in the new [[Lockheed NF-104A]], Yeager's aircraft spins out of control and he is nearly killed in a high-speed ejection. Seriously burned, Yeager simply gathers up his parachute upon landing and walks to the ambulance, proving that he still has the \"Right Stuff.\"\n\nOn May 15, 1963, Cooper has a successful launch on [[Mercury-Atlas 9]], ending the Mercury program. As the last American to fly into space alone, the narrator notes he \"went higher, farther, and faster than any other American ... for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Fred Ward]] as [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom]], [[USAF]]\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Gordo Cooper]], USAF\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[John Glenn]], [[U.S. Marine Corps|USMC]]\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as [[Alan Shepard]], [[U.S. Navy|USN]]\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as [[Chuck Yeager]], Colonel, USAF\n* [[Travis Herald]] as Private\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Wally Schirra|Walter \"Wally\" Schirra]], USN\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as [[Deke Slayton|Donald K. \"Deke\" Slayton]], USAF\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Glennis Yeager\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as [[Betty Grissom]]\n* [[Jane Dornacker]] as Nurse Murch\n* [[Harry Shearer]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]] as NASA recruiters sent to find astronaut candidates\n* [[Kim Stanley]] as [[Pancho Barnes]]\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Trudy Cooper\n* [[Charles Frank]] as [[Scott Carpenter]], USN\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as U.S. Senator and Vice President [[Lyndon B.

[[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] was originally attached but fell through; so did [[John Avildsen]] who, four years prior, had won an Oscar for his work under Winkler and Chartoff on the original ''[[Rocky]]''.

He took the actors flying, studied the storyboards and special effects, and pointed out the errors. To prepare for their roles, Kaufman gave the actors playing the seven astronauts an extensive videotape collection to study.<ref name=\"Ansen\" />\n\nThe effort to make an authentic feature led to the use of many full-size aircraft, scale models and special effects to replicate the scenes at Edwards Air Force Base and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].<ref>Farmer 1983, p. 47.</ref> Special visual effects supervisor Gary Gutierrez said the first special effects were too clean for the desired \"dirty, funky, early NASA look.\"<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> So Gutierrez and his team started from scratch, employing unconventional techniques, like going up a hill with model airplanes on wires and fog machines to create clouds, or shooting model F-104s from a crossbow device and capturing their flight with up to four cameras.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> Avant garde filmmaker Jordan Belson created the background of the Earth as seen from high-flying planes and from orbiting spacecraft.<ref name=\"Wilford\" />\n\nKaufman gave his five editors a list of documentary images he needed, sending them off to search for film from NASA, the Air Force, and Bell Aircraft vaults.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> They also discovered Russian stock footage not viewed in 30 years. During production, Kaufman met with resistance from the Ladd Company and threatened to quit several times. In December 1982, one reel of cut workprint of the film that included portions of John Glenn's flight disappeared from Kaufman's editing facility in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood. The missing reel of cut workprint was never found, but was reconstructed using a black and white duplicate copy of the reel as a guide and reprinting new workprint from the original negative, which was always safely in storage at the film lab.\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nAlthough ''The Right Stuff''  was based on historical events and real people, as chronicled in Wolfe's book, some substantial dramatic liberties were taken. Neither Yeager's flight in the X-1 to break the sound barrier early in the film or his later, nearly fatal flight in the NF-104A were spur-of-moment, capriciously decided events, as the film seems to imply - they actually were part of the routine testing program for both aircraft.

By the time astronaut recruitment began in late 1957 after the Soviets had orbited [[Sputnik]], Grissom had already left Edwards and returned to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], where he had served previously and was happy with his new assignment there.

The first draft of the script in 1980 had concentrated only on the Mercury 7 but as subsequent revisions developed the treatment into more of the original story that Wolfe had envisioned, the aircraft of the late-1940s that would have been seen at Edwards AFB were required. Wilmore gathered World War II era \"prop\" aircraft including:\n* [[Douglas A-26 Invader]]\n* [[North American P-51 Mustang]]\n* [[North American T-6 Texan]] and\n* [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]\n\nThe first group were mainly \"set dressing\" on the ramp while the [[Confederate Air Force]] (now renamed the Commemorative Air Force) B-29 [[FIFI (aircraft)|\"Fifi\"]] was modified to act as the B-29 \"mothership\" to carry the [[Bell X-1]] and [[Bell X-1#X-1A|X-1A]] rocket-powered record-breakers.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\">Farmer 1983, pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\nOther \"real\" aircraft included the early jet fighters and trainers as well as current USAF and [[United States Navy]] examples.

The first was an essentially static X-1 that had to at least roll along the ground and realistically \"belch flame\" by a simulated rocket blast from the exhaust pipes.<ref name=\"Farmer p.49\" /> A series of wooden mock-up X-1s were used to depict interior shots of the cockpit, the mating up of the X-1 to a modified B-29 fuselage and bomb bay and ultimately to recreate flight in a combination of model work and live-action photography. The \"follow-up\" X-1A was also an all-wooden model.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\" />\n\nThe U.S. Navy's [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]] that Crossfield duelled with Yeager's X-1 and X-1A was recreated from a modified [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighter. The climactic flight of Yeager in a [[Lockheed NF-104A]] was originally to be made with a modified [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] but ultimately, Wilmore decided that the production had to make do with a repainted Luftwaffe F-104G, which lacks the rocket engine of the NF-104.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\" />\n\nWooden mock-ups of the Mercury space capsules also realistically depicted the NASA spacecraft and were built from the original mold.<ref name=\"Wilford\" />\n\nFor many of the flying sequences, scale models were produced by USFX Studios and filmed outdoors in natural sunlight against the sky. Even off-the-shelf plastic scale models were utilized for aerial scenes. The X-1, F-104 and B-29 models were built in large numbers as a number of the more than 40 scale models were destroyed in the process of  filming.<ref>Farmer 1984, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> The blending together of miniatures, full-scale mock-ups and actual aircraft was seamlessly integrated into the live-action footage.

It was adapted from [[Tom Wolfe]]'s best-selling [[The Right Stuff (book)|1979 book of the same name]] about the Navy, Marine and Air Force [[test pilot]]s who were involved in [[aeronautics|aeronautical research]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], as well as the [[Mercury Seven]], the seven military pilots who were selected to be the [[astronaut]]s for [[Project Mercury]], the first [[human spaceflight]] by the United States. The film was written and directed by [[Philip Kaufman]] and stars [[Ed Harris]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Barbara Hershey]]. [[Levon Helm]] narrates, and plays Air Force test pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]].\n\nThe film was a box-office failure, grossing about $21 million against a $27 million budget. Despite this, it received widespread critical acclaim and eight [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[56th Academy Awards]], four of which it won. It holds a ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' rating of 96%. In 2013 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"2013Add\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/library-of-congress-announces-2013-national-film-registry-selections/2013/12/17/eba98bce-6737-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html?tid=hpModule_ef3e52c4-8691-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394 \"Library of Congress announces 2013 National Film Registry selections\" (Press release).]  ''[[Washington Post]]'',  December 18, 2013.

Death is a part of their life. After [[privateer]] [[Slick Goodlin]] demands $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1947|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to attempt to break the [[sound barrier]] in the X1, World War II hero Captain [[Chuck Yeager]] is given the chance. While horseback riding with his wife, Glennis, Yeager falls and breaks his ribs, an injury which inhibits his ability to lock the door on the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the secret mission, he confides in friend and fellow pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]], who solves the problem by giving Yeager the stump of a broom handle to use as leverage. Though the X1 bucks like a wild bronco, and pushes him to his limit, Yeager goes [[supersonic]] and becomes an international hero - a role he is uncomfortable in.\n\nSix years later, Muroc, by then Edwards Air Force Base, remains a beehive of danger, competition, and risky behavior. Major Yeager and friendly rival [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] repeatedly break each other's speed records. They often visit the [[Happy Bottom Riding Club]] run by pioneering aviatrix [[Pancho Barnes]] for raucous nights of drinking.  Loud and vulgar, she favors the pilots at Edwards who fly the best equipment, such as Yeager and Crossfield, whom she dubs \"prime\", over green \"pudknockers\" who only dream about it. Newly arrived [[United States Air Force]] captains [[Gordon Cooper|Gordon \"Gordo\" Cooper]], [[Gus Grissom|Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom]], and [[Deke Slayton|Donald \"Deke\" Slayton]] hope to prove that they have \"the Right Stuff\". Publicity has replaced secrecy to generate continued funding, adding further pressure to the pilots. Cooper's wife, Trudy, and other wives fear becoming widows as the ever more gripping competitions of man versus machine, man versus Nature, and man versus man grow, but cannot change their husbands' powerful ambitions and what they lead to.\n\nIn 1957, the launch of the Soviet [[Sputnik]] satellite [[Sputnik crisis|triggers a crisis]] for the United States government. Politicians such as Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and military leaders demand America wage and win an emerging [[Space Race]]. [[NASA]] is founded, and seeks to develop the first U.S. [[astronaut]]s.  In spite of his proven abilities Yeager is excluded because he lacks a college degree. Grueling physical and mental tests select an initial roster of gentlemen officers drawn from the U.S. Air Force and naval aviation.  These include [[Alan Shepard]], [[Wally Schirra]], [[Scott Carpenter]] of the [[United States Navy]], [[John Glenn]] from the [[United States Marine Corps]], and Cooper, Grissom and Slayton.  Dubbed the \"[[Mercury Seven]]\", the men immediately become national heroes. In spite of repeated launchpad and in-flight explosions of the booster rockets which will carry them, the ambitious competitors all hope to be the first in Space as part of [[Project Mercury]]. Early U.S. test flights include a [[Ham (chimpanzee)|chimpanzee]] to test [[G-force]]s and other loads upon animal life.  NASA engineers view the astronauts basically similarly, as mere passengers on pre-programmed flight paths. Insulted, the men insist that the Mercury spacecraft at least have a window, a hatch with explosive bolts, and [[pitch-yaw-roll]] controls to give them some role in its piloting. However, Russia beats them into Space on April 12, 1961 with the launch of [[Vostok 1]] carrying [[Yuri Gagarin]]. U.S. efforts redouble.\n\nShepard is the first American to reach space on the 15-minute sub-orbital flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 3]], on May 5, 1961. After Grissom's similar flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 4]] on July 21, the capsule's hatch blows open upon splashdown and quickly fills with water. Grissom escapes, but the spacecraft sinks. Many accuse him of opening the hatch prematurely and panicking, a personal smirch, not on the program. Glenn, boosted on [[Mercury-Atlas 6]], becomes the first American to orbit the Earth on February 20, 1962.  He survives a possibly loose heat shield and receives a [[ticker-tape parade]]. The entire Mercury Seven and their families become celebrities, and are feted at a gigantic celebration to announce the opening of the [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Space Center]] in [[Houston]].\n\nAlthough test pilots at Edwards mock the Mercury program for sending \"Spam in a can\" into Space, they recognize the courage it takes, irrespective of flying skill.  Yeager states that \"it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially when it's on national TV.\" While attempting to set a new altitude record at the edge of space in the new [[Lockheed NF-104A]], Yeager's aircraft spins out of control and he is nearly killed in a high-speed ejection. Seriously burned, Yeager simply gathers up his parachute upon landing and walks to the ambulance, proving that he still has the \"Right Stuff.\"\n\nOn May 15, 1963, Cooper has a successful launch on [[Mercury-Atlas 9]], ending the Mercury program. As the last American to fly into space alone, the narrator notes he \"went higher, farther, and faster than any other American ... for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Fred Ward]] as [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom]], [[USAF]]\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Gordo Cooper]], USAF\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[John Glenn]], [[U.S. Marine Corps|USMC]]\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as [[Alan Shepard]], [[U.S. Navy|USN]]\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as [[Chuck Yeager]], Colonel, USAF\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Wally Schirra|Walter \"Wally\" Schirra]], USN\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as [[Deke Slayton|Donald K. \"Deke\" Slayton]], USAF\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Glennis Yeager\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as [[Betty Grissom]]\n* [[Jane Dornacker]] as Nurse Murch\n* [[Harry Shearer]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]] as NASA recruiters sent to find astronaut candidates\n* [[Kim Stanley]] as [[Pancho Barnes]]\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Trudy Cooper\n* [[Charles Frank]] as [[Scott Carpenter]], USN\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as U.S. Senator and Vice President [[Lyndon B.

[[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] was originally attached but fell through; so did [[John Avildsen]] who, four years prior, had won an Oscar for his work under Winkler and Chartoff on the original ''[[Rocky]]''. (''The Right Stuff'' would have reunited Avildsen with both producers, and also with a fourth ''Rocky'' veteran, composer [[Bill Conti]].) <ref>Goldman 2001, p 257.</ref> \n\nUltimately, Chartoff and Winkler approached director [[Philip Kaufman]], who agreed to make the film but did not like Goldman's script; Kaufman disliked the emphasis on patriotism, and wanted Yeager put back in the film.<ref>Goldman 2001, p. 258.</ref> Eventually, Goldman quit the project in August 1980 and United Artists pulled out.\n\nWhen Wolfe showed no interest in adapting his own book, Kaufman wrote a draft in eight weeks.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> His draft restored Yeager to the story because \"if you're serious about tracing where the future \u2014 read: space travel \u2014 began, its roots lay with Yeager and the whole test pilot-subculture.

Then [[The Ladd Company]] stepped in with an estimated $17 million.\n===Casting===\nActor Ed Harris auditioned twice in 1981 for the role of John Glenn. Originally, Kaufman wanted to use a troupe of contortionists to portray the press corps, but settled on the improvisational comedy troupe [[Fratelli Bologna]], known for its sponsorship of \"St. Stupid's Day\" in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=\"Williams\">Williams, Christian. \"A Story that Pledges Allegiance to Drama and Entertainment.\"  ''[[Washington Post]]'', October 20, 1983, A18.</ref> The director created a locust-like chatter to accompany the press corps whenever they appear, which was achieved through a sound combination of (among other things) motorized Nikon cameras and clicking beetles.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n===Filming===\nMost of the film was shot in and around San Francisco between March and October 1982, with additional filming continuing into January 1983.  A waterfront warehouse there was transformed into a studio.<ref name=\"Ansen\" />{{refn|Downtown San Francisco doubled for [[Lower Manhattan]] in the [[ticker-tape parade]] scene after John Glenn's return to Earth.

He took the actors flying, studied the storyboards and special effects, and pointed out the errors. To prepare for their roles, Kaufman gave the actors playing the seven astronauts an extensive videotape collection to study.<ref name=\"Ansen\" />\n\nThe effort to make an authentic feature led to the use of many full-size aircraft, scale models and special effects to replicate the scenes at Edwards Air Force Base and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].<ref>Farmer 1983, p. 47.</ref> Special visual effects supervisor Gary Gutierrez said the first special effects were too clean for the desired \"dirty, funky, early NASA look.\"<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> So Gutierrez and his team started from scratch, employing unconventional techniques, like going up a hill with model airplanes on wires and fog machines to create clouds, or shooting model F-104s from a crossbow device and capturing their flight with up to four cameras.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> Avant garde filmmaker Jordan Belson created the background of the Earth as seen from high-flying planes and from orbiting spacecraft.<ref name=\"Wilford\" />\n\nKaufman gave his five editors a list of documentary images he needed, sending them off to search for film from NASA, the Air Force, and Bell Aircraft vaults.<ref name=\"Ansen\" /> They also discovered Russian stock footage not viewed in 30 years. During production, Kaufman met with resistance from the Ladd Company and threatened to quit several times. In December 1982, one reel of cut workprint of the film that included portions of John Glenn's flight disappeared from Kaufman's editing facility in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood. The missing reel of cut workprint was never found, but was reconstructed using a black and white duplicate copy of the reel as a guide and reprinting new workprint from the original negative, which was always safely in storage at the film lab.\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nAlthough ''The Right Stuff''  was based on historical events and real people, as chronicled in Wolfe's book, some substantial dramatic liberties were taken. Neither Yeager's flight in the X-1 to break the sound barrier early in the film or his later, nearly fatal flight in the NF-104A were spur-of-moment, capriciously decided events, as the film seems to imply - they actually were part of the routine testing program for both aircraft. Yeager had already test-flown both aircraft a number of times previously and was very familiar with them.<ref>Young, Dr. James..

By the time astronaut recruitment began in late 1957 after the Soviets had orbited [[Sputnik]], Grissom had already left Edwards and returned to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], where he had served previously and was happy with his new assignment there. Grissom did not even know he was under consideration for the astronaut program until he received mysterious orders \"out of the blue\" to report to Washington in civilian clothing for what turned out to be a recruitment session for  NASA.<ref name=\"Grissom\"/> <!--There has also been criticism of the way the film portrayed Grissom\u2019s loss of his capsule, feeling it unfairly cast him in an unfavorable light.---See much more detailed explanation of the Liberty 7 incident in the 'Reviews' section of the \"Reception\"---->\n\nWhile the film took liberties with certain historical facts as part of \"dramatic license\", criticism focused on one: the portrayal of [[Gus Grissom]] panicking when his ''[[Liberty Bell 7]]'' spacecraft sank following splashdown. Most historians, as well as engineers working for or with [[NASA]] and many of the related contractor agencies within the aerospace industry, are now convinced that the premature detonation of the spacecraft hatch's explosive bolts was caused by mechanical failure not associated with direct human error or deliberate detonation by Grissom.{{refn|Schirra proved that activating the hatch explosives would have left a large welt on any part of the body that came in contact with the trigger.

However, Kaufman was closely following [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book, which focused not on how or why the hatch actually blew, but how NASA engineers and some of Grissom's colleagues (and even his own wife) believed he caused the accident; much of the dialogue in this sequence was taken directly from Wolfe's prose.<ref>Wolfe 1983, chapter 10 \"The Unscrewable Pooch\".</ref><ref>Ebert, Roger.

The \"follow-up\" X-1A was also an all-wooden model.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\" />\n\nThe U.S. Navy's [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]] that Crossfield duelled with Yeager's X-1 and X-1A was recreated from a modified [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighter. The climactic flight of Yeager in a [[Lockheed NF-104A]] was originally to be made with a modified [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] but ultimately, Wilmore decided that the production had to make do with a repainted Luftwaffe F-104G, which lacks the rocket engine of the NF-104.<ref name=\"Farmer p. 50\u201351\" />\n\nWooden mock-ups of the Mercury space capsules also realistically depicted the NASA spacecraft and were built from the original mold.<ref name=\"Wilford\" />\n\nFor many of the flying sequences, scale models were produced by USFX Studios and filmed outdoors in natural sunlight against the sky. Even off-the-shelf plastic scale models were utilized for aerial scenes. The X-1, F-104 and B-29 models were built in large numbers as a number of the more than 40 scale models were destroyed in the process of  filming.<ref>Farmer 1984, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> The blending together of miniatures, full-scale mock-ups and actual aircraft was seamlessly integrated into the live-action footage. The addition of original newsreel footage was used sparingly but to effect to provide another layer of authenticity.<ref>Farmer 1984, p. 66.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Right Stuff'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] on October 16, 1983, at the [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], to benefit the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"Morganthau\">Morganthau, Tom and Richard Manning. \"Glenn Meets the Dream Machine.\" ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 3, 1983, p. 36.</ref><ref name=\"Arnold\">Arnold, Gary. \"The Stuff of Dreams.\"  ''[[Washington Post]]'', October 16, 1983, p.

It went into [[wide release]] on February 17, 1984, in 627 theaters where it grossed an additional $1.6 million on that weekend. But despite this, the movie bombed at the box office with $21.1 million. The failure of this and ''[[Twice Upon a Time (1983 film)|Twice Upon a Time]]'' caused The Ladd Company to shut down.\n\nAs part of the promotion for the film, Veronica Cartwright, Chuck Yeager, Gordon Cooper, Scott Glenn and Dennis Quaid appeared in 1983 at ConStellation, the [[41st World Science Fiction Convention]] in Baltimore.<ref>[http://www.fanac.org/worldcon/ConStellation/w83p008.html \"1983 World Science Fiction Convention.\"] ''fanac.org,'' 2012.

The film holds a 96% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 8.81/10.

The cameo appearance by the real Chuck Yeager in the film was a particular \"treat\" which Osborne cited. The recounting of many of the legendary aspects of Yeager's life was left in place, including the naming of the X-1, \"Glamorous Glennis\" after his wife and his superstitious preflight ritual of asking for a stick of [[Beemans gum|Beemans chewing gum]] from his best friend, Jack Ridley.{{refn|This allusion to Beemans chewing gum was later included in ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991).|group = Note}}\n\nWhen the film came out, the former (and future) astronaut [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Glenn]] of [[Ohio]] was running for the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. In the weeks before the movie's premiere, media pundits as well as people in the Democratic Party wondered that if the film became a big success, it could give Glenn an advantage in the upcoming primaries, a speculation that eventually proved groundless.\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n''The Right Stuff'' won four [[Academy Awards]]: for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]] ([[Jay Boekelheide]]), for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]] ([[Mark Berger (sound engineer)|Mark Berger]], [[Tom Scott (sound engineer)|Tom Scott]], [[Randy Thom]] and [[David MacMillan (sound engineer)|David MacMillan]]).<ref name=\"Oscars1984\">[http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1984 \"The 56th Academy Awards (1984) Nominees and Winners.\"] ''oscars.org.''
