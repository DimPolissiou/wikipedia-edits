Reprinted in Berkman (ed.), ''The Blast: Complete Collection of the Incendiary San Francisco Bi-Monthly Anarchist Newspaper,'' pg. 12.</ref>\n\nIn an introductory editorial statement, Berkman noted that the provocatively-named publication would be both destructive and constructive in intent:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Before a garden can bloom, the weeds must be uprooted. Nothing is therefore more important than to destroy. Nothing more necessary and difficult.... <br /><br />\n\"To destroy the Old and the False is the most vital work.

''The Blast'' focused on the California labor situation and provided news about national labor events and leaders of radical political movements.\n\nBerkman ultimately published 29 issues of ''The Blast.''\n\n===Preparedness Day Bombing===\n\nThe sensational July 1916 [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] of the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade \u2014 a terrorist attack which killed 8 and wounded more than 40 others \u2014 took place while Berkman was already publishing ''The Blast'' in that same city.<ref name=Drinnon402>Richard Drinnon, \"Blast, San Francisco, 1916-1917,\" in Joseph R.

Bourke Cockran]] to work on the case on a [[pro bono]] basis.<ref name=Drinnon403>Drinnon, \"Blast,\" pg. 403.</ref> Many pages of ''The Blast,'' unsurprisingly, were committed to the Mooney-Billings defense effort. This activity lead to another police raid on ''The Blast's'' offices on December 31, 1916.<ref name=Pateman6 /> In this second raid the publication's mailing list and editorial correspondence was seized.<ref name=Pateman6 />\n\nBy May 1917 the editorial office of ''The Blast'' had been moved from the uncomfortably tense San Francisco to New York City, where it was located in the same building as the editorial office of ''Mother Earth.''<ref name=Pateman6 /> Shortly thereafter California authorities, despite having \"absolutely no real evidence to go on\" from their December raid, nevertheless obtained a [[grand jury]] indictment of Berkman on a charge of murder in association with the Preparedness Day bombing.<ref name=Drinnon403 /> By the time of the California indictment Berkman had already been arrested and detained in New York City along with Emma Goldman on charges of conspiracy to undermine wartime [[conscription]], however, and the West coast case against him came to naught.<ref name=Drinnon403 />\n\n===Termination and legacy===\n\n''The Blast'' was shut down in June 1917 in the aftermath of Berkman's arrest for encouraging resistance to the draft. The publication's final issue, dated June 1, 1917, featured an [[anti-militarism|anti-militarist]] cartoon by [[Maurice Becker]] on the cover and a short piece signed by Berkman inside which boldly declared:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Conscription is the abdication of your rights as a citizen. Conscription is the cemetery where every vestige of your liberty is to be buried. Registration is its undertaker.<br /><br />\n\"No man with red blood in his veins can be forced to fight against his will.

Reprinted in Berkman (ed.), ''The Blast: Complete Collection of the Incendiary San Francisco Bi-Monthly Anarchist Newspaper,'' pg. 12.</ref>\n\nIn an introductory editorial statement, Berkman noted that the provocatively-named publication would be both destructive and constructive in intent:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Before a garden can bloom, the weeds must be uprooted. Nothing is therefore more important than to destroy. Nothing more necessary and difficult.... <br /><br />\n\"To destroy the Old and the False is the most vital work. We emphasize it: to blast the bulwarks of slavery and oppression is of primal necessity. It is the beginning of really lasting construction.\"<ref>Alexander Berkman, \"Why the Blast?\" ''The Blast,'' vol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 15, 1916), pg. 2.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe journal was originally conceived by Berkman as a \"revolutionary labor paper\" rather than a strictly anarchist newspaper.  ''The Blast'' focused on the California labor situation and provided news about national labor events and leaders of radical political movements.\n\nBerkman ultimately published 29 issues of ''The Blast.''\n\n===Preparedness Day Bombing===\n\nThe sensational July 1916 [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] of the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade \u2014 a terrorist attack which killed 8 and wounded more than 40 others \u2014 took place while Berkman was already publishing ''The Blast'' in that same city.<ref name=Drinnon402>Richard Drinnon, \"Blast, San Francisco, 1916-1917,\" in Joseph R.

Billings]] and [[Tom Mooney]] as well as Mooney's wife [[Rena Mooney]] and two others, were arrested for the crime, Berkman again had occasion to take part in a nationwide legal defense effort, cooperating closely with Mooney-Billings Defense Committee principal Robert Minor in the effort.<ref name=Drinnon402 />\n\nIn addition to founding the first local Mooney-Billings defense organization, Berkman travelled the country raising funds and public consciousness in support of the effort and winning the commitment of prominent New York attorney [[W. Bourke Cockran]] to work on the case on a [[pro bono]] basis.<ref name=Drinnon403>Drinnon, \"Blast,\" pg. 403.</ref> Many pages of ''The Blast,'' unsurprisingly, were committed to the Mooney-Billings defense effort. This activity lead to another police raid on ''The Blast's'' offices on December 31, 1916.<ref name=Pateman6 /> In this second raid the publication's mailing list and editorial correspondence was seized.<ref name=Pateman6 />\n\nBy May 1917 the editorial office of ''The Blast'' had been moved from the uncomfortably tense San Francisco to New York City, where it was located in the same building as the editorial office of ''Mother Earth.''<ref name=Pateman6 /> Shortly thereafter California authorities, despite having \"absolutely no real evidence to go on\" from their December raid, nevertheless obtained a [[grand jury]] indictment of Berkman on a charge of murder in association with the Preparedness Day bombing.<ref name=Drinnon403 /> By the time of the California indictment Berkman had already been arrested and detained in New York City along with Emma Goldman on charges of conspiracy to undermine wartime [[conscription]], however, and the West coast case against him came to naught.<ref name=Drinnon403 />\n\n===Termination and legacy===\n\n''The Blast'' was shut down in June 1917 in the aftermath of Berkman's arrest for encouraging resistance to the draft. The publication's final issue, dated June 1, 1917, featured an [[anti-militarism|anti-militarist]] cartoon by [[Maurice Becker]] on the cover and a short piece signed by Berkman inside which boldly declared:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Conscription is the abdication of your rights as a citizen. Conscription is the cemetery where every vestige of your liberty is to be buried. Registration is its undertaker.<br /><br />\n\"No man with red blood in his veins can be forced to fight against his will.

The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u20131999===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Williams College]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a [[lawn ornament]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] that is no longer in business. At first Collingwood hated the name but eventually warmed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/waynes-world-6423163|title=Wayne's World|first=Ted|last=Simons|website=Phoenix New Times|date=1997-05-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> Previous band names included Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], then recruited guitarist [[Jody Porter]] and still-active Posies drummer [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne's label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of [[Swingtown (song)|\"Swingtown\"]] by [[Steve Miller Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2007/04/brian-young/|title=Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne|first=Waleed|last=Rashidi|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=April 2007|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThough Collingwood and Schlesinger shared cowriter credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together, they wrote their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, \"We decided early on, it\u2019s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, \u2018I wrote 15% of that song,\u2019 and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.\" Schlesinger added, \"We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we\u2019d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven\u2019t collaborated as writers in years. And that\u2019s kind of intentional too because we didn\u2019t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, 'Adam\u2019s songs are like this\u2026' We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|magazine=American Songwriter|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the band released its [[Fountains of Wayne (album)|self-titled debut]], which spawned the singles \"[[Radiation Vibe]]\" and \"[[Sink to the Bottom]]\", and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], and [[The Lemonheads]]. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold-certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.\n\n[[File:Fountains of Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fountains of Wayne performing in April 2007]]\n\n===2000\u20132011===\n\nThe band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, \"When we got dropped from Atlantic, it\u2019s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to keep doing it.  At the end of four years of the hardest work I\u2019d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it.  I got back home and I had nothing.  I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted.  I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/fountains.htm|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Record Sales|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|publisher=PopEntertainment.com|date=2004-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nSchlesinger cowrote many of the songs for the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' film and soundtrack, produced albums for [[Verve Pipe]], [[David Mead (musician)|David Mead]], and [[They Might Be Giants]], and released a third record with his other band, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]]. Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, the [[The Cars|Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nAlso in 2005, [[Robbie Fulks]] released a song in honor of the band called \"Fountains of Wayne Hotline.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fulks |first1=Robbie |title=Adam Schlesinger Celebrated by \u2018Fountains of Wayne Hotline\u2019 Creator Robbie Fulks |url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/adam-schlesinger-celebrated-fountains-of-wayne-hotline-robbie-fulks-1234569967/ |website=Variety |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000.

According to Porter, \"It\u2019s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn\u2019t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down.

The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, \"The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we've ever done. I think I'm partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end.

I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over.

The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u20131999===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Williams College]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a [[lawn ornament]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] that is no longer in business. At first Collingwood hated the name but eventually warmed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/waynes-world-6423163|title=Wayne's World|first=Ted|last=Simons|website=Phoenix New Times|date=1997-05-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> Previous band names included Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], then recruited guitarist [[Jody Porter]] and still-active Posies drummer [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne's label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of [[Swingtown (song)|\"Swingtown\"]] by [[Steve Miller Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2007/04/brian-young/|title=Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne|first=Waleed|last=Rashidi|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=April 2007|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThough Collingwood and Schlesinger shared cowriter credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together, they wrote their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, \"We decided early on, it\u2019s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, \u2018I wrote 15% of that song,\u2019 and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.\" Schlesinger added, \"We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we\u2019d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven\u2019t collaborated as writers in years. And that\u2019s kind of intentional too because we didn\u2019t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, 'Adam\u2019s songs are like this\u2026' We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|magazine=American Songwriter|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the band released its [[Fountains of Wayne (album)|self-titled debut]], which spawned the singles \"[[Radiation Vibe]]\" and \"[[Sink to the Bottom]]\", and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], and [[The Lemonheads]]. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold-certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.\n\n[[File:Fountains of Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fountains of Wayne performing in April 2007]]\n\n===2000\u20132011===\n\nThe band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, \"When we got dropped from Atlantic, it\u2019s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to keep doing it.  At the end of four years of the hardest work I\u2019d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it.  I got back home and I had nothing.  I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted.  I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/fountains.htm|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Record Sales|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|publisher=PopEntertainment.com|date=2004-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nSchlesinger cowrote many of the songs for the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' film and soundtrack, produced albums for [[Verve Pipe]], [[David Mead (musician)|David Mead]], and [[They Might Be Giants]], and released a third record with his other band, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]]. Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, the [[The Cars|Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nAlso in 2005, [[Robbie Fulks]] released a song in honor of the band called \"Fountains of Wayne Hotline.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fulks |first1=Robbie |title=Adam Schlesinger Celebrated by \u2018Fountains of Wayne Hotline\u2019 Creator Robbie Fulks |url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/adam-schlesinger-celebrated-fountains-of-wayne-hotline-robbie-fulks-1234569967/ |website=Variety |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000.

According to Porter, \"It\u2019s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn\u2019t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down. Overall it\u2019s not as brash or guitar-heavy.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/130729-out-of-the-shadows-into-the-light-an-interview-with-jody-porter-2496141124.html|title=Out of the Shadows, Into the Light: An Interview with Jody Porter|author=Souleo|magazine=Popmatters|date=2010-09-14|accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the band released ''[[Sky Full of Holes]]'', an album put out in Japan by [[Warner Music Japan]] (with two bonus tracks), Europe by [[Lojinx]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojinx.com/releases/fountains-of-wayne/sky-full-of-holes |title=Lojinx // Fountains of Wayne / Sky Full of Holes album |publisher=Lojinx.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> and the U.S. by [[Yep Roc Records]]. The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, \"The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we've ever done. I think I'm partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end.

I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over.

It was first broadcast on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] on 17 February 1993 and was watched by 14.31&nbsp;million viewers during its original transmission.{{r|\"1feTx\"}} This was the first episode to consist of a single story line and was shot entirely on location in [[Southsea]].\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Act 1: Checking In ===\nFor a [[bank holiday]] weekend, [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] decides to stay at the [[Queens Hotel (Southsea)|Queens Hotel]] to which upon parking [[Mr. Bean#The Mini|his Mini]] at the foot of the entrance stairs, he fights with the [[Bellhop|bellboy]] ([[Matthew Ashforde]]) over his suitcase, mistaking him for a thief.  While Bean is checking in, the bellboy returns and asks Bean to move his car, and Bean hands him the steering wheel with which to go and park the car for him. As Bean checks in, a quiet man ([[Michael Fenton Stevens]]) checks in as well and Bean becomes determined to beat the man to his hotel room (room 425), but the man gets to the [[elevator|lift]] before him. In retaliation, Bean runs up the staircase and stops the lift on every floor. He almost succeeds in entering his room first, but struggles to unlock his door and the man ultimately enters his room before Bean enters his.\n\nOnce inside his room, Bean immediately starts investigating, such as flicking the light switch on and off rapidly, standing on his suitcase to see the sea through his window, testing out the telephone, jumping on the bed, and when the bellboy returns and clears his throat to ask for a tip, he gives him a [[Throat lozenge|cough sweet]] instead. Bean finds the [[remote control]] for the television and initially mistakes it for a phone, due to his own TV at home having no remote. He tests the remote control's signal range and turns the volume up once he is outside his room until his other neighbour in room 427 comes outside to investigate the noise. Bean hides the remote in his jacket and pretends to tell the guest inside room 426 to be quiet, and goes back inside once the neighbour is gone.\n\nBack in his room, Bean unpacks his suitcase and places Teddy in his makeshift \"bed\" in the drawer, accidentally decapitating him in the process. He personalises the room by changing the lampshade for his own, placing his own curtains on the window and drilling holes to hang framed pictures on the walls (the noise can be heard throughout the hotel). He then decides to have a bath, but realises his room doesn't have a bathroom. Bean then hears running water in room 425, and is annoyed to discover that that room has an [[en suite]] bathroom whereas his doesn't. Bean uses a glass to listen through the wall to locate the bathroom, and then once the man in room 425 leaves, he uses his drill to cut a giant hole in the wall for him to gain access to the bathroom.\n\nOnce again, the noise is heard throughout the hotel, and the vibration travels all the way to the lobby and restaurant, prompting the manager ([[Roger Brierley]]) to investigate where it is coming from. Just as he knocks on the door to Mr. Bean's room, the man from room 425 complains that he left his watch in the bathroom but can't get the door open. The manager also tries to turn the handle (in vain) and apologises to the man, suggesting that it may be jammed.\n\nHowever, it is revealed that Bean has locked the door and is in the bathtub quickly washing himself. He then finishes and hides the hole with his wardrobe and the curtains from the bathroom. The manager then says that he will have someone come and look at the man's bathroom door just as Bean peeks out of his room wearing nothing but a towel to see what all the fuss is about. The manager notices this as Bean heads back into his room and gives him a suspicious look before walking away.\n\n=== Act 2: The Rotten Oysters ===\nAt lunchtime, Bean again tries to beat his neighbour to the dining room by knocking on his door and then running off, only to find that the lift is out of order. Annoyed, he goes to take the fire exit stairs, but becomes even more annoyed when he gets stuck behind a slow-moving elderly woman with a walking frame.{{r|\"May2015\"}} Instead of simply asking the lady to let him pass, he decides to go around to the other staircase, but becomes further annoyed when he somehow ends up stuck behind her again. He then contemplates pushing her, but stops himself when he hears a couple walking past.\n\nFed up knowing that it is a big staircase and that he could be there for a long time, he takes a risk and climbs onto the opposite side of the banister to finally get past her. But his victory is short-lived when he ends up behind an equally slow-moving elderly man with 2 walking sticks (presumably the lady's husband). Now stuck between the two with insufficient space to repeat the same tactic and still feeling unable to ask for space to pass, Bean is forced to go down slowly.\n\nOnce he reaches the restaurant, he takes a plate and cutlery and sees his neighbour and three people ahead of him in the queue. As a result, he cheats his way to the front by knocking the cutlery and napkin from the two people in front of him. Now behind his neighbour, he proceeds to copy what food he is taking from the [[buffet]], but doubling the quantity and even going so far as to fill his entire plate with [[Oyster]]s, and putting back what the man puts back. Bean then steals the table that his neighbour was going to sit at and starts imitating him by [[drinking water]] and using a [[napkin]] before putting an obscene amount of [[salt]] onto his food.\n\nHe then gluttonously eats whatever the man is eating at a certain time sush as [[chicken wings]], [[vegetables]], and [[sausages]]. When the man starts to eat his oysters, Bean eats all of his without smelling them. However, the man notices an odd smell coming from his own oysters and asks the headwaiter about it; the headwaiter smells them and apologizes by saying that they are [[Shelf life|off]], then goes to collect the platter of oysters from the buffet and is repulsed by the smell. Upon seeing what is happening, Bean becomes scared and sickly that he has just eaten rotten oysters.{{r|\"Gordon2001\"}}\n\n=== Act 3: Locked Out Naked ===\nThat night, with lots of tissue paper and a full chest of medicines beside him, Bean is feeling unwell with a high fever as a result of eating the rotten oysters from earlier and wakes up from a nightmare about his neighbour and the restaurant owner laughing demonically at him while oysters are being eaten nastily. He then removes his pyjamas (as he feels hot) and is about to go back to sleep when music blasts from next door. Bean looks at the alarm clock and upon realizing that it is 12:05&nbsp;am, gets up while forgetting that he's nude, knocks angrily at the door and shushes loudly. The music stops and he walks back to his room just as the door closes and locks itself. He reaches for his key, only to remember he does not have it. To make matters worse, he finds himself locked outside his room naked. Panicked and humiliated, Bean hides in a doorway as a couple come past from a night out.\n\nOnce they have gone, he manages to escape by covering himself with a [[fire extinguisher]] and several door signs (\"Private\", \"Exit\", etc.) while avoiding people. He begins to run down the stairs, only to get stuck behind the elderly lady yet again. So he goes back up and heads for the lift; on the way he comes across another couple making out, so he sneaks past them by crawling under the carpet.  He then enters the lift, but the door closes on the string by which he is dragging the \"Exit\" sign along with him. We then see the floor numbers go down and hear a lady screaming in sheer shock.\n\nDown in the lobby, Bean peeks out the lift and sneaks out with \"Out of Order\" and \"No Entry\" signs, into his work space. Meanwhile, the manager is talking to [[Danny La Rue]] (played by himself), who is performing at the hotel, saying his show was marvellous and that they love him. The performer delightfully goes back in to give them an [[encore]]. The clerk then gives Matthew (the porter) the keys to the car and tells him to bring them to Mr. La Rue's car. Meanwhile, Mr. Bean gets the keys to his room from the front, and hides behind a pole as Matthew parks the suitcase and leaves.\n\nThe manager gets back behind his counter and almost sees the suitcase moving several times (Bean being in it changing). Matthew then comes back and locks the suitcase, and brings it out to the car, dropping it on the stairs. Just then, Mr. Bean shows up at the counter in a sparkly [[gown]] and wig and lipstick, saying \"426 please\", and the manager replies \"Certainly, madam\".\n\nRight at that moment, [[Danny La Rue]] walks by, noticing his stuff is being worn. So he approaches angrily, and says to him \"Here, that's my frock\" and yanks an earring off Bean's ear, and the screen suddenly goes black, while we hear Bean unconvincingly cry out in pain.\n\n== Production ==\nThis was the first episode to incorporate only one storyline instead of separate acts or sketches as well as the first to be shot entirely on location. The episode was filmed at the [[Queens Hotel (Southsea)|Queen's Hotel]] in the seaside resort of [[Southsea]], [[Portsmouth]], Hampshire. [[Principal photography]] began on 1 October 1992.{{r|\"wDLac\"}}\n\nIt was also the first full episode to be directed by [[Paul Weiland]], previously the series' specialist director for film sequences. Another episode-length story, ''[[Mind the Baby, Mr. Bean]]'', was also filmed in [[Southsea]].\n\nThis was also the first episode to be commissioned and presented for the ITV network by [[Central Independent Television]] following the loss of Thames' ITV franchise in London. Central would also oversee commissioning and compliance for a number of other Thames independent productions, such as ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'', ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]'' and ''[[Strike It Lucky]]'', until the ITV Network Centre removed the requirement for a 'commissioning company' in the late 1990s.\n\n\"Homeless\" from ''[[Mr. Bean (animated series)|Mr. Bean: The Animated Series]]'' was inspired by this episode. The last scene also inspired the episode \"Opera Bean\" where Bean wears a lady's frock.\n\n== Censorship ==\nSome scenes of Bean naked during the final part of the episode were edited out for broadcasts on [[Disney Channel]] and Philippine network [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]. This episode was never broadcast on [[Nickelodeon UK]], possibly due to Bean being naked for the majority of the last act.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"May2015\">{{cite book\n  | author    = Shaun May\n  | title     = A Philosophy of Comedy on Stage and Screen: You Have to be There\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZSwCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT109\n  | date      = 17 December 2015\n  | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n  | isbn      = 978-1-4725-8045-0\n  | pages     = 109\u2013\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"1feTx\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mrbean.co.uk/timeline\n |title       = Timeline\n |publisher   = mrbean.co.uk\n |accessdate  = 4 January 2014\n|url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130922195147/http://www.mrbean.co.uk/timeline\n |archivedate = 22 September 2013\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"wDLac\">[http://www.queenshotelportsmouth.com/ Queenshotelportsmouth.com]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gordon2001\">{{cite book\n  | author    = Rae Beth Gordon\n  | title     = Why the French Love Jerry Lewis: From Cabaret to Early Cinema\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=_FpLENBMIq4C&pg=PA223\n  | year      = 2001\n  | publisher = Stanford University Press\n  | isbn      = 978-0-8047-3894-1\n  | pages     = 223\u2013\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb episode|0651849}}\n* {{Tv.com episode|70202}}\n\n{{Mr. Bean}}\n\n[[Category:Mr. Bean episodes]]\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television programs written by Rowan Atkinson]]\n[[Category:Television programs written by Robin Driscoll]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Mr. Bean in Room 426\n| series       = [[Mr. Bean]]\n| image        =\n| caption      =\n| season       =\n| series_no    =\n| episode      = 8\n| writer       = [[Robin Driscoll]]<br />[[Rowan Atkinson]]\n| director     = [[Paul Weiland]]\n| teleplay     =\n| story        =\n| producer     = [[Sue Vertue]]\n| music        =\n| photographer =\n| editor       =\n| production   =\n| airdate      = {{Start date|1993|February|17|df=y}}\n| length       = 24:58\n| guests       = [[Danny La Rue]]<br />[[Roger Brierley]]<br />[[Matthew Ashforde]]<br />[[Michael Fenton Stevens]]\n| awards       =\n| season_list  =\n| prev         = [[Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean]]\n| next         = [[Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean]]\n| episode_list = List of Mr. Bean episodes\n}}\n\n\"'''Mr. Bean in Room 426'''\" is the eighth episode of the British television series ''[[Mr. Bean]]'', produced by [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Television]] and [[Thames Television]] for [[Central Independent Television]]. It was first broadcast on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] on 17 February 1993 and was watched by 14.31&nbsp;million viewers during its original transmission.{{r|\"1feTx\"}} This was the first episode to consist of a single story line and was shot entirely on location in [[Southsea]].\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Act 1: Checking In ===\nFor a [[bank holiday]] weekend, [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] decides to stay at the [[Queens Hotel (Southsea)|Queens Hotel]] to which upon parking [[Mr. Bean#The Mini|his Mini]] at the foot of the entrance stairs, he fights with the [[Bellhop|bellboy]] ([[Matthew Ashforde]]) over his suitcase, mistaking him for a thief.  While Bean is checking in, the bellboy returns and asks Bean to move his car, and Bean hands him the steering wheel with which to go and park the car for him. As Bean checks in, a quiet man ([[Michael Fenton Stevens]]) checks in as well and Bean becomes determined to beat the man to his hotel room (room 425), but the man gets to the [[elevator|lift]] before him. In retaliation, Bean runs up the staircase and stops the lift on every floor. He almost succeeds in entering his room first, but struggles to unlock his door and the man ultimately enters his room before Bean enters his.\n\nOnce inside his room, Bean immediately starts investigating, such as flicking the light switch on and off rapidly, standing on his suitcase to see the sea through his window, testing out the telephone, jumping on the bed, and when the bellboy returns and clears his throat to ask for a tip, he gives him a [[Throat lozenge|cough sweet]] instead. Bean finds the [[remote control]] for the television and initially mistakes it for a phone, due to his own TV at home having no remote. He tests the remote control's signal range and turns the volume up once he is outside his room until his other neighbour in room 427 comes outside to investigate the noise. Bean hides the remote in his jacket and pretends to tell the guest inside room 426 to be quiet, and goes back inside once the neighbour is gone.\n\nBack in his room, Bean unpacks his suitcase and places Teddy in his makeshift \"bed\" in the drawer, accidentally decapitating him in the process. He personalises the room by changing the lampshade for his own, placing his own curtains on the window and drilling holes to hang framed pictures on the walls (the noise can be heard throughout the hotel). He then decides to have a bath, but realises his room doesn't have a bathroom. Bean then hears running water in room 425, and is annoyed to discover that that room has an [[en suite]] bathroom whereas his doesn't. Bean uses a glass to listen through the wall to locate the bathroom, and then once the man in room 425 leaves, he uses his drill to cut a giant hole in the wall for him to gain access to the bathroom.\n\nOnce again, the noise is heard throughout the hotel, and the vibration travels all the way to the lobby and restaurant, prompting the manager ([[Roger Brierley]]) to investigate where it is coming from.
