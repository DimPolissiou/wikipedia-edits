Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world. \n\nThe stories locate it somewhere in [[Great Britain]] and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its unspecified geography being perfect for [[chivalric romance]] writers. Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the \"real Camelot\" have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe name's derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romances, including '''''Camaalot''''', '''''Camalot''''', '''''Chamalot''''', '''''Camehelot''''' (sometimes read as ''Camchilot''), '''''Camaaloth''''', '''''Caamalot''''', '''''Camahaloth''''', '''''Camaelot''''', '''''Kamaalot''''', '''''Kamaaloth''''', '''''Kaamalot''''', '''''Kamahaloth''''', '''''Kameloth''''', '''''Kamaelot''''', '''''Kamelot''''', '''''Kaamelot''''', '''''Cameloth''''', '''''Camelot''''' and '''''Gamalaot'''''.<ref name=\"Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480\">Loomis, Roger Sherman, Arthurian tradition & Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Columbia University Press, 1961, p. 480.</ref><ref>Sommer, Heinrich Oskar, The Vulgate Version of the Arthurian Romances: Lestoire de Merlin, Carnegie Institution, 1916, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71\">Brugger, Ernst, \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Erkl\u00e4rung der arthurischen Geographie\", in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr franz\u00f6sische Sprache und Literatur, Volume 28, 1905, pp. 1\u201371.</ref> Arthurian scholar [[Ernst Brugger]] suggested that it was a corruption of the site of Arthur's final battle, the [[Battle of Camlann]], in Welsh tradition.<ref name=\"Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71\"/> [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] believed it was derived from ''Cavalon'', a place name that he suggested was a corruption of [[Avalon]] (under the influence of the Breton place name ''Cavallon''). He further suggested that Cavalon became Arthur's capital due to confusion with Arthur's other traditional court at [[Caerleon|Carlion]] (''Caer Lleon'' in Welsh).<ref name=\"Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480\"/>\n\nOthers have suggested a derivation from the [[British Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] place name [[Camulodunum]], one of the first capitals of [[Roman Britain]] and which would have significance in [[Romano-British culture]]. Indeed, [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]], the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the [[Roman Empire]] and the history of [[Sub-Roman Britain]], suggested in his book ''The Age of Arthur'' that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name \"Camelot\" of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of [[Britannia]] (Camulodunum) in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] would have encountered the name Camulodunum, or why he would render it as ''Camaalot'', though [[Urban T. Holmes Jr.|Urban T. Holmes]] argued in 1929 that Chr\u00e9tien had access to Book 2 of [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's ''Natural History'']], where it is rendered as ''Camaloduno''.<ref>Nitze, William A. et al.

In the C manuscript (Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, fonds fran\u00e7ais 794, folio 27r), which might in fact contain the proper reading of Chretien's original text,<ref>Wolfgang, Lenora D., \"Chretien's Lancelot: Love and Philology,\" Reading Medieval Studies, 17 (1991), pp. 3-17 (pp. 11-12).</ref> instead of the place name we find the [[Old French]] phrase ''con lui plot'', meaning \"as he pleased\". The other manuscripts spell the name variously as ''Chamalot'' (MS A, f. f. 196r), ''Camehelot'' (MS E, f. 1r), ''Chamaalot'' (MS G, f. 34f), and ''Camalot'' [MS T, f. 41v]; the name is missing, along with the rest of the passage containing it, in MS V [Vatican, Biblioteca Vaticana, Regina 1725]).<ref name=\"Lacy\"/><ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/cammenu.htm \"Camelot\"].

For Chr\u00e9tien, Arthur's chief court was in [[Caerleon]] in [[Wales]]; this was the king's primary base in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and subsequent literature.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Chr\u00e9tien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles.\n\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| align = left\n| image1 = Siedl\u0119cin Wie\u017ca Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119ca Gotyckie malowid\u0142a \u015bcienne Zamek Camelot i Kr\u00f3lowa Ginewra.JPG\n| image2 = Raimund von Wichera - Guinevere and the Court at Camelot.jpg\n| footer = \n| direction = vertical\n| caption1 = Guinevere at Camelot in a 14th-century fresco at [[Siedl\u0119cin Tower]]\n| caption2 = Raimund von Wichera's ''Guinevere and the Court at Camelot'' (1900)\n}}\n\nIt is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|Post-Vulgate]] cycles, that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French. One exception is ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', which locates Arthur's court at \"Camelot\";<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 37.</ref> however, in Britain, Arthur's court was generally located at Caerleon, or at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which is usually identified with the \"Carduel\" of the French romances.<ref>Ashley, pp. 612\u2013613.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| align = right\n| image1 = The Great Hall, Camelot, Act IV.png\n| image2 = The Tournament at Camelot.png\n| footer = \n| direction = vertical\n| caption1 = The Great Hall of Camelot, a scene painting by [[Hawes Craven]] (1895)\n| caption2 = A jousting tournament at Camelot, an ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' illustration by George and [[Louis Rhead]] (1898)\n}}\n\nThe Lancelot-Grail Cycle and the texts it influenced depict the city of Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from [[Astolat]].

From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the [[chivalry]] and courtesy of its inhabitants.<ref name=\"Lacy\" /> Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in [[Celliwig]], an uncertain locale in [[Cornwall]].\n\nAlthough the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the [[Welsh Triads]] agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the [[Celtic Britons]]: Cornwall, Wales and the [[Hen Ogledd]]. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as [[Arthur's Seat]], indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] areas of Britain as well as [[Brittany]]. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location.<ref name=\"Cadbury\">[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]] (1991). \"Topography and Local Legends\". In Norris J.

He firmly identifies Camelot with [[Winchester]] in England, an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory's own editor, [[William Caxton]], who preferred a Welsh location.<ref name=\"Caxton\">Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', p. xvii.</ref>\n\n== Identifications ==\n[[File:The Great Hall, Winchester Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1540296.jpg|thumb|[[Winchester Castle]]'s Great Hall with a 13th-century prop [[Round Table]]]]\n\nArthurian scholar [[Norris J.

The Celliwig of ''Culhwch and Olwen'' appears in the Welsh Triads as well; this early Welsh material places Wales' greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey's description of Caerleon is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and [[Isca Augusta|its Roman ruins]]; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. Several French romances (''Perlesvaus'', the Didot ''Perceval'' attributed to [[Robert de Boron]], and even the early romances of Chr\u00e9tien such as ''[[Erec and Enide]]'' and ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'') have Arthur hold court at \"Carduel in Wales\", a northern city based on the real Carlisle. Malory's identification of Camelot as Winchester was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history: it had been the capital of [[Wessex]] under [[Alfred the Great]], and boasted the [[Winchester Round Table]], an artifact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory's time. Caxton rejected the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at [[Caerwent]].<ref name=\"Caxton\"/>\n\nIn 1542, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] reported the locals around [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]], formerly known as Camalet,<ref name=rev>Phelps, W.

Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot.\n\nThe name of the Romano-British town of Camulodunum (modern [[Colchester]]) was derived from the Celtic god [[Camulus]]. However, it was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by Saxons, so it is unlikely to have been the location of any \"true\" Camelot.

This is because of the name, and also regarding its strategic location: it is but a few miles from the extreme south-west of Hen Ogledd (also making close to [[North Wales]]), and would have been a great flagship point in staving off attacks to the Celtic kingdoms from the [[Angles]] and others.\n\nOther places in Britain with names related to \"Camel\" have also been suggested, such as [[Camelford]] in Cornwall, located down the [[River Camel]] from where Geoffrey places Camlann, the scene of Arthur's final battle. The area's connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative. Further north [[Camelon]] and its connections with [[Arthur's O'on]] have been mentioned in relation to Camelot, but Camelon may be an [[antiquarian]] [[neologism]] coined after the 15th century, with its earlier name being ''Carmore'' or ''Carmure''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibb|first1=Alexander|title=The Stirling Antiquary: Reprinted from \"The Stirling Sentinel,\" 1888\u2013[1906]|date=1904|publisher=Cook & Wylie|location=Stirling|pages=349\u2013365|url=https://archive.org/stream/stirlingantiqua01unkngoog#page/n361/mode/2up/search/camelon|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Later uses ==\nCamelot has become a permanent fixture in interpretations of the Arthurian legend.

Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world. \n\nThe stories locate it somewhere in [[Great Britain]] and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its unspecified geography being perfect for [[chivalric romance]] writers. Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the \"real Camelot\" have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe name's derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romances, including '''''Camaalot''''', '''''Camalot''''', '''''Chamalot''''', '''''Camehelot''''' (sometimes read as ''Camchilot''), '''''Camaaloth''''', '''''Caamalot''''', '''''Camahaloth''''', '''''Camaelot''''', '''''Kamaalot''''', '''''Kamaaloth''''', '''''Kaamalot''''', '''''Kamahaloth''''', '''''Kameloth''''', '''''Kamaelot''''', '''''Kamelot''''', '''''Kaamelot''''', '''''Cameloth''''', '''''Camelot''''' and '''''Gamalaot'''''.<ref name=\"Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480\">Loomis, Roger Sherman, Arthurian tradition & Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Columbia University Press, 1961, p. 480.</ref><ref>Sommer, Heinrich Oskar, The Vulgate Version of the Arthurian Romances: Lestoire de Merlin, Carnegie Institution, 1916, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71\">Brugger, Ernst, \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Erkl\u00e4rung der arthurischen Geographie\", in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr franz\u00f6sische Sprache und Literatur, Volume 28, 1905, pp. 1\u201371.</ref> Arthurian scholar [[Ernst Brugger]] suggested that it was a corruption of the site of Arthur's final battle, the [[Battle of Camlann]], in Welsh tradition.<ref name=\"Brugger, Ernst 1905, pp. 1-71\"/> [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] believed it was derived from ''Cavalon'', a place name that he suggested was a corruption of [[Avalon]] (under the influence of the Breton place name ''Cavallon''). He further suggested that Cavalon became Arthur's capital due to confusion with Arthur's other traditional court at [[Caerleon|Carlion]] (''Caer Lleon'' in Welsh).<ref name=\"Loomis, Roger Sherman 1961, p. 480\"/>\n\nOthers have suggested a derivation from the [[British Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] place name [[Camulodunum]], one of the first capitals of [[Roman Britain]] and which would have significance in [[Romano-British culture]]. Indeed, [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]], the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the [[Roman Empire]] and the history of [[Sub-Roman Britain]], suggested in his book ''The Age of Arthur'' that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name \"Camelot\" of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of [[Britannia]] (Camulodunum) in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] would have encountered the name Camulodunum, or why he would render it as ''Camaalot'', though [[Urban T. Holmes Jr.|Urban T. Holmes]] argued in 1929 that Chr\u00e9tien had access to Book 2 of [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's ''Natural History'']], where it is rendered as ''Camaloduno''.<ref>Nitze, William A. et al.

In the C manuscript (Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, fonds fran\u00e7ais 794, folio 27r), which might in fact contain the proper reading of Chretien's original text,<ref>Wolfgang, Lenora D., \"Chretien's Lancelot: Love and Philology,\" Reading Medieval Studies, 17 (1991), pp. 3-17 (pp. 11-12).</ref> instead of the place name we find the [[Old French]] phrase ''con lui plot'', meaning \"as he pleased\". The other manuscripts spell the name variously as ''Chamalot'' (MS A, f. f. 196r), ''Camehelot'' (MS E, f. 1r), ''Chamaalot'' (MS G, f. 34f), and ''Camalot'' [MS T, f. 41v]; the name is missing, along with the rest of the passage containing it, in MS V [Vatican, Biblioteca Vaticana, Regina 1725]).<ref name=\"Lacy\"/><ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/cammenu.htm \"Camelot\"].

For Chr\u00e9tien, Arthur's chief court was in [[Caerleon]] in [[Wales]]; this was the king's primary base in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and subsequent literature.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Chr\u00e9tien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles.\n\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| align = left\n| image1 = Siedl\u0119cin Wie\u017ca Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119ca Gotyckie malowid\u0142a \u015bcienne Zamek Camelot i Kr\u00f3lowa Ginewra.JPG\n| image2 = Raimund von Wichera - Guinevere and the Court at Camelot.jpg\n| footer = \n| direction = vertical\n| caption1 = Guinevere at Camelot in a 14th-century fresco at [[Siedl\u0119cin Tower]]\n| caption2 = Raimund von Wichera's ''Guinevere and the Court at Camelot'' (1900)\n}}\n\nIt is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the [[Lancelot-Grail]] and the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|Post-Vulgate]] cycles, that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town.<ref name=\"Lacy\"/> Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French.

From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the [[chivalry]] and courtesy of its inhabitants.<ref name=\"Lacy\" /> Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in [[Celliwig]], an uncertain locale in [[Cornwall]].\n\nAlthough the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the [[Welsh Triads]] agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the [[Celtic Britons]]: Cornwall, Wales and the [[Hen Ogledd]]. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as [[Arthur's Seat]], indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] areas of Britain as well as [[Brittany]]. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location.<ref name=\"Cadbury\">[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]] (1991). \"Topography and Local Legends\". In Norris J.

He firmly identifies Camelot with [[Winchester]] in England, an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory's own editor, [[William Caxton]], who preferred a Welsh location.<ref name=\"Caxton\">Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', p. xvii.</ref>\n\n== Identifications ==\n[[File:The Great Hall, Winchester Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1540296.jpg|thumb|[[Winchester Castle]]'s Great Hall with a 13th-century prop [[Round Table]]]]\n\nArthurian scholar [[Norris J.

The Celliwig of ''Culhwch and Olwen'' appears in the Welsh Triads as well; this early Welsh material places Wales' greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey's description of Caerleon is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and [[Isca Augusta|its Roman ruins]]; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. Several French romances (''Perlesvaus'', the Didot ''Perceval'' attributed to [[Robert de Boron]], and even the early romances of Chr\u00e9tien such as ''[[Erec and Enide]]'' and ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'') have Arthur hold court at \"Carduel in Wales\", a northern city based on the real Carlisle. Malory's identification of Camelot as Winchester was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history: it had been the capital of [[Wessex]] under [[Alfred the Great]], and boasted the [[Winchester Round Table]], an artifact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory's time. Caxton rejected the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at [[Caerwent]].<ref name=\"Caxton\"/>\n\nIn 1542, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] reported the locals around [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]], formerly known as Camalet,<ref name=rev>Phelps, W.

Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot.\n\nThe name of the Romano-British town of Camulodunum (modern [[Colchester]]) was derived from the Celtic god [[Camulus]]. However, it was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by Saxons, so it is unlikely to have been the location of any \"true\" Camelot.

This is because of the name, and also regarding its strategic location: it is but a few miles from the extreme south-west of Hen Ogledd (also making close to [[North Wales]]), and would have been a great flagship point in staving off attacks to the Celtic kingdoms from the [[Angles]] and others.\n\nOther places in Britain with names related to \"Camel\" have also been suggested, such as [[Camelford]] in Cornwall, located down the [[River Camel]] from where Geoffrey places Camlann, the scene of Arthur's final battle. The area's connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative. Further north [[Camelon]] and its connections with [[Arthur's O'on]] have been mentioned in relation to Camelot, but Camelon may be an [[antiquarian]] [[neologism]] coined after the 15th century, with its earlier name being ''Carmore'' or ''Carmure''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibb|first1=Alexander|title=The Stirling Antiquary: Reprinted from \"The Stirling Sentinel,\" 1888\u2013[1906]|date=1904|publisher=Cook & Wylie|location=Stirling|pages=349\u2013365|url=https://archive.org/stream/stirlingantiqua01unkngoog#page/n361/mode/2up/search/camelon|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Later uses ==\nCamelot has become a permanent fixture in interpretations of the Arthurian legend.

Inspired by Alcock's Cadbury-Camelot excavation, some authors such as [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] and [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]] place their Camelots in that place and describe it accordingly.<ref name=\"Cadbury\" />\n\n[[File:Tintagel DSC 7491.jpg|thumb|Camelot Castle Hotel (a view from [[Tintagel Castle]]) features a replica of the Winchester Round Table<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Conjuring the Ghosts of Camelot: Tintagel and the Medievalism of Heritage Tourism|url=https://www.academia.edu/29915353|journal=Medieval Afterlives in Contemporary Culture|language=en}}</ref>|alt=]]\n\nCamelot lends its name to the musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', which was adapted into a [[Camelot (film)|film of the same title]], featuring the Castle of [[Coca, Segovia]] as Camelot. An Arthurian television series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' was also named after the castle, as were some other works including the video game ''[[Camelot (video game)|Camelot]]'' and the comic book series ''[[Camelot 3000]]''.

He was the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times in 1962. Following his retirement from NASA, he served from 1974 to 1999 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States senator]] from [[Ohio]], and, in 1998, flew into space again at age 77.\n\nBefore joining [[NASA]], Glenn was a distinguished [[fighter pilot]] in [[World War II]], [[Operation Beleaguer|China]] and [[Korean War|Korea]]. He shot down three [[MiG-15]]s, and was awarded six [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Crosses]] and eighteen [[Air Medal]]s. In 1957, he made the first [[supersonic]] [[transcontinental flight]] across the United States. His on-board camera took the first continuous, panoramic photograph of the United States.\n\nHe was one of the [[Mercury Seven]], military [[test pilot]]s selected in 1959 by NASA as the nation's first astronauts. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the ''[[Mercury-Atlas 6|Friendship 7]]'' mission, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and the fifth person and third American in space. He received the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1962, the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in 1978, was inducted into the [[U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame]] in 1990, and received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2012.\n\nGlenn resigned from NASA in January 1964. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Glenn was first [[United States Senate election in Ohio, 1974|elected to the Senate in 1974]] and served for 24 years, until January 1999. In 1998, while still a sitting senator, Glenn flew on [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']]'s [[STS-95]] mission, making him, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space and the only person to fly in both the Mercury and the [[Space Shuttle program]]s. Glenn, both the oldest and the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven, died at the age of 95 in 2016. He is survived by his wife [[Annie Glenn]], an advocate for people with disabilities and communication disorders.\n\nBirthday party \nJohn Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in [[Cambridge, Ohio]], the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr. (1895\u20131966), who worked for a plumbing firm, and Clara Teresa ({{nee|Sproat}}; 1897\u20131971), a teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/tdowling?lang=en&n=glenn&oc=1&p=john+herschel|title=John Glenn's parents|publisher=Geneanet.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=John F.

This damaged American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the [[Sputnik crisis]]. In response, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D.

One of its first initiatives was announced on December 17, 1958. This was [[Project Mercury]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=25\u201329}} which aimed to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]], return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}}\n\nWhile Glenn was on duty at Patuxent and in Washington, he read everything he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to [[Langley Air Force Base]] in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed NASA into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also be sent to the [[Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster|Naval Air Development Center]] in [[Johnsville, Pennsylvania]], and would be subjected to high [[G-force]]s in a [[centrifuge]] for comparison with data collected in the simulator.

The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the [[United States Department of Defense]]. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards:{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201339}} the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent, and be {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} or less.

The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]], and the USAF officers were addressed by the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]]. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They warned that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=46\u201351}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\n[[File:Mercury Seven astronauts with aircraft.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts posing with a USAF [[F-106]].|alt=The astronauts pose in alphabetical order in front of a delta-winged white jet aircraft.

Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. As this seemed an adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to six.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=42}} Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]] and the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=43\u201347}} Only one candidate, [[Jim Lovell]], was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=234\u2013237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations.

Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hangar and altitude tests, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=418}}\n\nAfter a long series of delays,{{sfn|Burgess|2015|pp=80\u201386}} ''Friendship 7'' lifted off from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the countdown due to equipment malfunctions and improvements and the weather. During Glenn's first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] had loosened. If this reading had been accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would have burned up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion on how to deal with this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. The retrorocket pack broke up into large chunks of flaming debris which flew past the window of his capsule during re-entry; Glenn thought this might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, \"Fortunately it was the rocket pack\u2014or I wouldn't be answering these questions.\"<ref name=\"nasaambass\" /> After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose; the sensor was faulty.<ref name=CBS />\n\n[[File:Astronaut John Glenn being Honored - GPN-2000-000607.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dignitaries on an outdoor stage in front of a building with NASA Manned Spacecraft Center on the side|Glenn being honored by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F.

He was the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times in 1962. Following his retirement from NASA, he served from 1974 to 1999 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States senator]] from [[Ohio]], and, in 1998, flew into space again at age 77.\n\nBefore joining [[NASA]], Glenn was a distinguished [[fighter pilot]] in [[World War II]], [[Operation Beleaguer|China]] and [[Korean War|Korea]]. He shot down three [[MiG-15]]s, and was awarded six [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Crosses]] and eighteen [[Air Medal]]s. In 1957, he made the first [[supersonic]] [[transcontinental flight]] across the United States. His on-board camera took the first continuous, panoramic photograph of the United States.\n\nHe was one of the [[Mercury Seven]], military [[test pilot]]s selected in 1959 by NASA as the nation's first astronauts. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the ''[[Mercury-Atlas 6|Friendship 7]]'' mission, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and the fifth person and third American in space. He received the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1962, the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in 1978, was inducted into the [[U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame]] in 1990, and received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2012.\n\nGlenn resigned from NASA in January 1964. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Glenn was first [[United States Senate election in Ohio, 1974|elected to the Senate in 1974]] and served for 24 years, until January 1999. In 1998, while still a sitting senator, Glenn flew on [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']]'s [[STS-95]] mission, making him, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space and the only person to fly in both the Mercury and the [[Space Shuttle program]]s. Glenn, both the oldest and the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven, died at the age of 95 in 2016. He is survived by his wife [[Annie Glenn]], an advocate for people with disabilities and communication disorders.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in [[Cambridge, Ohio]], the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr. (1895\u20131966), who worked for a plumbing firm, and Clara Teresa ({{nee|Sproat}}; 1897\u20131971), a teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/tdowling?lang=en&n=glenn&oc=1&p=john+herschel|title=John Glenn's parents|publisher=Geneanet.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=John F.

The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]], and the USAF officers were addressed by the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]]. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They warned that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=46\u201351}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\n[[File:Mercury Seven astronauts with aircraft.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts posing with a USAF [[F-106]].|alt=The astronauts pose in alphabetical order in front of a delta-winged white jet aircraft.

Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. As this seemed an adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to six.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=42}} Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]] and the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=43\u201347}} Only one candidate, [[Jim Lovell]], was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=234\u2013237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations.

Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hangar and altitude tests, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=418}}\n\nAfter a long series of delays,{{sfn|Burgess|2015|pp=80\u201386}} ''Friendship 7'' lifted off from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the countdown due to equipment malfunctions and improvements and the weather. During Glenn's first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the [[ablative heat shield|heat shield]] had loosened. If this reading had been accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would have burned up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion on how to deal with this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. The retrorocket pack broke up into large chunks of flaming debris which flew past the window of his capsule during re-entry; Glenn thought this might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, \"Fortunately it was the rocket pack\u2014or I wouldn't be answering these questions.\"<ref name=\"nasaambass\" /> After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose; the sensor was faulty.<ref name=CBS />\n\n[[File:Astronaut John Glenn being Honored - GPN-2000-000607.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dignitaries on an outdoor stage in front of a building with NASA Manned Spacecraft Center on the side|Glenn being honored by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F.

A few days later, due to the aforementioned clerical error, it was redesignated the '''25th Aero Squadron'''.<ref name=25SRSfacts/> After the United States' entry into [[World War I]], the squadron deployed to Europe aboard [[RMS Carmania (1905)|RMS ''Carmania'']], first to England, then to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France in late October 1918.  it was assigned to the [[4th Pursuit Group]] of the Second Army Air Service in the [[Toul|Toul Sector]], but without any airplanes.  The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft. The unit returned to the United States in the spring of 1919 and was [[demobilized]] in June.\n\n===Defense of the Panama Canal===\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron Keystone Bomber.jpg|thumb|Squadron Keystone LB-6 in Panama, 1933]]\nThe '''25th Squadron''' (Bombardment) was organized on 1 October 1921 at [[Mitchel Field]], New York, although it is not clear whether it was equipped before moving to [[France Field]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] in April 1922, where the [[Panama Canal Department]] assigned it to the [[6th Composite Group]].<ref name=Conaway>{{cite web|url= http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/25thbshistorytem.htm |last1=Conaway|first1=William|title=VI Bomber Command in Defense of the Panama Canal 1941\u201345: Unit Histories: 25th Bombardment Squadron|publisher=planesandpilotsof wwii.totalh.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131031113408/http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/25thbshistorytem.htm |archivedate=31 October 2013|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref> It flew various biplane bombers to defend the [[Panama Canal]].

Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.

A few days later, due to the aforementioned clerical error, it was redesignated the '''25th Aero Squadron'''.<ref name=25SRSfacts/> After the United States' entry into [[World War I]], the squadron deployed to Europe aboard [[RMS Carmania (1905)|RMS ''Carmania'']], first to England, then to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France in late October 1918.  it was assigned to the [[4th Pursuit Group]] of the Second Army Air Service in the [[Toul|Toul Sector]], but without any airplanes.  The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft.

Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.

{"title_page": "Alan Grahame Brown", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n'''Alan Grahame Brown''' (23 October 1913 \u2013 5 January 1972) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] pharmaceutical chemist and politician. During a single term in Parliament, he abandoned the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] due to policy differences.\n\n== Training ==\nBrown was born in [[Wood Green]] in north London, although his family was from [[Bedford]] and moved back there quickly. He attended [[Bedford School]], and then decided to go into the field of pharmaceuticals by training at the [[The School of Pharmacy, University of London|College of the Pharmaceutical Society]].\n\n== Army career ==\nIn 1932 Brown joined the 5th Battalion of the [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment]], where he served for five years. At the end of his term he married a Bedford girl (they had two sons), and he also joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. However, his professional career as a pharmaceutical chemist had not had long to get going before he rejoined the Army in the [[Second World War]]. He served in the 4th Battalion of his old regiment for four years, and this time was commissioned as an officer, reaching the rank of Lieutenant.\n\n== Tottenham chemist ==\nBrown then returned to set up a chemists' shop in [[Tottenham]] and became active in local politics both through the Labour Party and [[Co-operative Party]] (he was chairman of the South Tottenham Co-operative Party from 1957 to 1960). In 1956 he was elected to [[Middlesex]] County Council, where he specialised in child welfare and juvenile delinquency.\n\n== Parliamentary candidate ==\nSir [[Frederick Messer]], the Labour Member of Parliament for [[Tottenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Tottenham]], announced in October 1958 that he would not seek re-election. Unlike Messer, the [[Constituency Labour Party]] was on the right-wing of the Labour Party and this was the wing Brown found himself on as well; with his local connections, Brown was selected. At his selection he pledged to use his influence within the Parliamentary Labour Party to further policies in accordance with those of the Constituency Labour Party. He comfortably retained the seat in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]].\n\n== Imprisonment of juveniles ==\nBrown launched a high-profile campaign very soon after his election, when he discovered that a 14-year-old girl who had truanted from school was being held on remand in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|HM Prison Holloway]] together with murderers. Brown successfully sought leave to introduce a Bill which would stop magistrates from sending children under 16 to prison, but the Bill was 'talked out' when debated.\n\n== Crossing the floor ==\nMeanwhile, the left-wing campaign in the Labour Party which had changed party policy to unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] caused Brown some discomfort. In March 1961, Brown wrote to [[Hugh Gaitskell]] declaring that he would not \"retreat one inch from what I believe is the correct and honourable position\", and announcing his resignation from the Labour Party to sit as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. Tottenham Constituency Labour Party gave him support, in line with their own views on party policy, by 36 votes to 1.\n\nOn being interviewed, Brown declared that defence policy was not the only area that he disagreed with Labour Party policy, and that his views on that issue were now closer to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government. During his period as an Independent member, his voting pattern in the House of Commons was similar to that of Conservative MPs. The Tottenham Constituency Labour Party proceeded to select a new candidate early in 1962, indicating that they did not expect Brown to rejoin. Early in May 1962, Brown was granted the Conservative whip.\n\n== Private members' bill ==\nIn November 1962 Brown was lucky in the ballot for [[Private Members' Bills]] and introduced the Nursing Homes Bill which allowed the government to register and regulate private nursing homes. This Bill was ultimately successful. In December 1962, Brown was rescued from a caravan in which he was sleeping near Parliament in which an oil heater had begun to leak and nearly caught fire; he explained that he used the caravan for child welfare work and occasionally slept there after late sittings.\n\nDespite having been adopted as Conservative candidate for Tottenham, Brown was upset by the [[Alec Douglas-Home|Douglas-Home]] government's abolition of resale price maintenance which he knew that many pharmaceutical chemists relied on to set prices. He set down a large stack of amendments to the Bill, but saw them rejected. At the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], Brown lost his seat back to Labour.\n\n== Private Life ==\n\nAlthough married with two sons, he fathered two and possibility three other children\n\n== Suicide ==\nIn April 1966 Brown rejoined the Labour Party. In January 1972, Brown's body was found <ref>Birmingham Daily Post</ref> by his 10-year-old daughter in a [[Bournemouth]] hotel room, having died by [[suicide]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* M.

From Summer 2021, Abbey Wood will be connected by Crossrail's [[Elizabeth Line]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe district takes its name from [[Lesnes Abbey Woods]], located to the east, which once belonged to the monks of [[Lesnes Abbey]].<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of London Place-Names|first=A.D.|last=Mills|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199566785|page=1}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe Abbey of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr at Lesnes (or [[Lesnes Abbey]]) was founded in 1178 by [[Richard de Luci]], Chief Justiciar of England. The Abbott of Lesnes Abbey was an important local landlord, and took a leading part in draining the marshland. However, this and the cost of maintaining river embankments was one of the reasons given for the Abbey's chronic financial difficulties. It never became a large community, and was closed by [[Cardinal Wolsey]] in 1525, under a licence to suppress monasteries of less than seven inmates. It was one of the first monasteries to be closed after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1524, and the monastic buildings were all pulled down, except for the Abbott's Lodging. Henry Cooke acquired the site in 1541 and it eventually passed to [[Sir John Hippersley]] who salvaged building materials, before selling the property to Thomas Hawes of London in 1632. It was then bequeathed to Christ's Hospital in 1633.\n\n[[Abbey Wood railway station]] was opened in 1849, immediately to the north of the area now known as \"The Village\", built where Knee Hill became Harrow Manorway. Contemporary maps show Knee Hill as a minor track compared with a more major pathway through the centre of the existing woods.<ref>See http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/greenwich/abbey-wood/map-abbey-wood-1870.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118070210/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/greenwich/abbey-wood/map-abbey-wood-1870.htm |date=18 November 2008 }}.</ref> The Village consisted of a dozen or so cottages, and two pubs, the Abbey Arms (next to the railway station) and the Harrow Inn (demolished in 2009).<ref>See http://www.stmichaelsabbeywood.co.uk/history.htm</ref> The Harrow Inn which was located on the Kent side of Abbey Wood was the place where live bands would play in their hall; it was also the scene of a nightly migration as drinkers would relocate to the Abbey Arms each night, as Kentish closing times used to be 10.30pm whilst the Abbey Arms, which was in London, closed at 11 o'clock.\n\nAbbey Wood was suggested as a site for a cemetery serving east London at a time of burial crisis in the capital. When the station was new, [[Edwin Chadwick]] proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] northwest of the city, which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London, while a large tract of land on the [[River Thames|Thames]] around {{convert|9|mi|km}} southeast of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John M.|title=The Brookwood Necropolist Railway, Locomotive Papers '''143''' (4th edn)|year=2006|publisher=The Orchard Press|page=8|isbn=978-0-85361-655-9}}</ref> The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick's scheme would ever be financially viable, and it was widely unpopular.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Catherine|title=Necropolis: London and its dead|year=2006|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=160|isbn=978-1-4165-0248-7}}</ref><ref name=clarke2>{{cite book|title=The Brookwood Necropolis Railway|page=11}}</ref> Although the [[Metropolitan Interments Act 1850]] authorised the scheme, it was abandoned in 1852.<ref name=clarke2 />\n\nThe [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] (RACS) owned two farms on the hillside to the south of The Village, and between 1900 and 1930 built the Bostall Estate. Once known as \"Tin Check Island\" after the Society's dividend system, and known locally as \"The Co-op Estate\", this has streets named after [[Co-operative]] themes (Alexander McLeod, the first secretary of the RACS, [[Rochdale Principles|Rochdale]], [[Robert Owen]], Congress), a school & shops but, like much social housing of the period, no public houses. The housing is largely traditional of the \"two-up, two-down\" design, in distinctive yellow London brick, with gardens to the front and rear.<ref>See http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/006.pdf for a more detailed description of the building of the Bostall Estate.</ref>\n\nBetween 1955 and 1959 the [[London County Council]] built the Abbey Estate starting with one road south of the railway and later extending on the northern side on former [[Royal Arsenal]] marshland. Predominantly conventional brick houses with gardens, at first there were no shops or pubs, later equipped with a few shops and pubs together with schools and open spaces were added. Transport was non existent at first until one bus, the route 180 was added after the building of Eynsham bridge. The estate was first used to rehouse people from Dockhead and Peckham then London's East End. The main through-road is Eynsham Drive.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the [[Greater London Council]] began building the first phase of [[Thamesmead]] on more ex-Royal Arsenal land, north-east of Abbey Wood station. The original railway level crossing was replaced by a flyover.\n\nAbbey Wood has benefited from the opening of the [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] station at Woolwich Arsenal, whilst the next stage in the development of the area will be the construction of [[Crossrail]], a development tipped to encourage the growth of local house prices by the time it is opened in Autumn 2019.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2817107/Crossrail-to-create-property-hot-spots.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Crossrail to create property hot spots | first=Emma | last=Thelwell | date=2007-10-05}}</ref> Abbey Wood will be connected by The [[Elizabeth Line]], with travel times of 11 minutes to [[Canary Wharf]] and 25 minutes to [[Bond Street]].\n\nThe [[List of wards in Greater London|Greenwich ward]] of Abbey Wood has a population of just over 13,000,<ref>http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/42616176-F28F-4577-A8A1-F3930C8B6902/0/_5_AbbeyWoodProfile.pdf</ref> and its rail station sees over 3 million passenger journeys a year.\n\n==Places of interest==\nPlaces of interest include the ruins of the 12th-century [[Lesnes Abbey]] and the adjacent [[Lesnes Abbey Woods]], a [[Local Nature Reserve]].

It is located {{convert|10.6|mi|km|0}} east of [[Charing Cross]]. It lies within the [[Historic counties of England|Historic County]] of [[History of Kent|Kent]]. From Summer 2021, Abbey Wood will be connected by Crossrail's [[Elizabeth Line]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe district takes its name from [[Lesnes Abbey Woods]], located to the east, which once belonged to the monks of [[Lesnes Abbey]].<ref name=\"Mills\">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of London Place-Names|first=A.D.|last=Mills|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199566785|page=1}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe Abbey of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr at Lesnes (or [[Lesnes Abbey]]) was founded in 1178 by [[Richard de Luci]], Chief Justiciar of England. The Abbott of Lesnes Abbey was an important local landlord, and took a leading part in draining the marshland. However, this and the cost of maintaining river embankments was one of the reasons given for the Abbey's chronic financial difficulties. It never became a large community, and was closed by [[Cardinal Wolsey]] in 1525, under a licence to suppress monasteries of less than seven inmates. It was one of the first monasteries to be closed after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1524, and the monastic buildings were all pulled down, except for the Abbott's Lodging. Henry Cooke acquired the site in 1541 and it eventually passed to [[Sir John Hippersley]] who salvaged building materials, before selling the property to Thomas Hawes of London in 1632. It was then bequeathed to Christ's Hospital in 1633.\n\n[[Abbey Wood railway station]] was opened in 1849, immediately to the north of the area now known as \"The Village\", built where Knee Hill became Harrow Manorway. Contemporary maps show Knee Hill as a minor track compared with a more major pathway through the centre of the existing woods.<ref>See http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/greenwich/abbey-wood/map-abbey-wood-1870.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118070210/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/greenwich/abbey-wood/map-abbey-wood-1870.htm |date=18 November 2008 }}.</ref> The Village consisted of a dozen or so cottages, and two pubs, the Abbey Arms (next to the railway station) and the Harrow Inn (demolished in 2009).<ref>See http://www.stmichaelsabbeywood.co.uk/history.htm</ref> The Harrow Inn which was located on the Kent side of Abbey Wood was the place where live bands would play in their hall; it was also the scene of a nightly migration as drinkers would relocate to the Abbey Arms each night, as Kentish closing times used to be 10.30pm whilst the Abbey Arms, which was in London, closed at 11 o'clock.\n\nAbbey Wood was suggested as a site for a cemetery serving east London at a time of burial crisis in the capital. When the station was new, [[Edwin Chadwick]] proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] northwest of the city, which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London, while a large tract of land on the [[River Thames|Thames]] around {{convert|9|mi|km}} southeast of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John M.|title=The Brookwood Necropolist Railway, Locomotive Papers '''143''' (4th edn)|year=2006|publisher=The Orchard Press|page=8|isbn=978-0-85361-655-9}}</ref> The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick's scheme would ever be financially viable, and it was widely unpopular.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Catherine|title=Necropolis: London and its dead|year=2006|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=160|isbn=978-1-4165-0248-7}}</ref><ref name=clarke2>{{cite book|title=The Brookwood Necropolis Railway|page=11}}</ref> Although the [[Metropolitan Interments Act 1850]] authorised the scheme, it was abandoned in 1852.<ref name=clarke2 />\n\nThe [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] (RACS) owned two farms on the hillside to the south of The Village, and between 1900 and 1930 built the Bostall Estate. Once known as \"Tin Check Island\" after the Society's dividend system, and known locally as \"The Co-op Estate\", this has streets named after [[Co-operative]] themes (Alexander McLeod, the first secretary of the RACS, [[Rochdale Principles|Rochdale]], [[Robert Owen]], Congress), a school & shops but, like much social housing of the period, no public houses. The housing is largely traditional of the \"two-up, two-down\" design, in distinctive yellow London brick, with gardens to the front and rear.<ref>See http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/006.pdf for a more detailed description of the building of the Bostall Estate.</ref>\n\nBetween 1955 and 1959 the [[London County Council]] built the Abbey Estate starting with one road south of the railway and later extending on the northern side on former [[Royal Arsenal]] marshland. Predominantly conventional brick houses with gardens, at first there were no shops or pubs, later equipped with a few shops and pubs together with schools and open spaces were added. Transport was non existent at first until one bus, the route 180 was added after the building of Eynsham bridge. The estate was first used to rehouse people from Dockhead and Peckham then London's East End. The main through-road is Eynsham Drive.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the [[Greater London Council]] began building the first phase of [[Thamesmead]] on more ex-Royal Arsenal land, north-east of Abbey Wood station. The original railway level crossing was replaced by a flyover.\n\nAbbey Wood has benefited from the opening of the [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] station at Woolwich Arsenal, whilst the next stage in the development of the area will be the construction of [[Crossrail]], a development tipped to encourage the growth of local house prices by the time it is opened in Autumn 2019.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2817107/Crossrail-to-create-property-hot-spots.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Crossrail to create property hot spots | first=Emma | last=Thelwell | date=2007-10-05}}</ref> Abbey Wood will be connected by The [[Elizabeth Line]], with travel times of 11 minutes to [[Canary Wharf]] and 25 minutes to [[Bond Street]].\n\nThe [[List of wards in Greater London|Greenwich ward]] of Abbey Wood has a population of just over 13,000,<ref>http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/42616176-F28F-4577-A8A1-F3930C8B6902/0/_5_AbbeyWoodProfile.pdf</ref> and its rail station sees over 3 million passenger journeys a year.\n\n==Places of interest==\nPlaces of interest include the ruins of the 12th-century [[Lesnes Abbey]] and the adjacent [[Lesnes Abbey Woods]], a [[Local Nature Reserve]].

Bostall Woods (part of the [[South East London Green Chain]]) includes one of the few camping and caravan sites in London, which is owned and operated by The Caravan Club. The co-operative woods were also the site of the first camp for the [[Woodcraft Folk]].\n\nSt. Michael and All Angels Parish Church [http://www.stmichaelsabbeywood.co.uk/St_Michael_home.htm] was opened in a temporary building in 1905. A permanent church, designed by Sir [[Arthur Blomfield]], was consecrated three years later, and the original building became the church hall.
