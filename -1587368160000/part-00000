The original inhabitants of the area were primarily Hindus. Later on this region gained a sizable Christian and Muslim population. The economy was agrarian with strong feudal system - Janmi-Kudiyan system - permeating everyday life.\n\nFeudal overloads or Janmies owned much of the land, which was leased by the farmers or Kudians who paid a portion (normally 2/10th) of their produce as \"pattam\" for the 'privilege' of working the land. Generally, the lease was for a period of 12\u201316 years. Farmers were not allowed to cultivate permanent crops, dig wells or cut down the trees on the land.  If any permanent crop such as pepper was planted on the land, the income from the crop went to the landlord after six years, depriving farmers of any income from such cash crops. Janmies gave 10 cents of land to farmers to build a house.\n\nThis region also has a sizable number of people belonging to tribal communities such as Mavilar, [[Pulayar]], and [[Vettuvar]] who lived by hunting animals and collecting edible roots and fruits from the plentiful forests in the area. Under the Janmi-Kudiyan feudal system, tribals were treated much like slaves.\n\n== Early farming methods ==\n\nUntil the early 1950s, this region used outdated agricultural practices and depended on the monsoons for its irrigation needs. Agricultural land lay fallow after harvest. At the beginning of the next growing season, the bushes that cover the land would be cleared and the plant material burned to prepare the land for the next cycle of rice cultivation. This method, known as punam krishi allowed people to grow staples like rice and black gram.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nA lack of basic transportation; roads and buses, plagued the area. Initially, the only available bus service was from Peringome which is about 10 kilometers from Cherupuzha. Anyone who needed to buy supplies from the nearby larger town of Payyannur had to ride a bullock cart or walk to get to Peringome. Presently [[Kerala State Road Transport Corporation|KSRTC (Kerala State Road Transport Corporation)]] is running Super Class Services through Cherupuzha to various destinations like Bangalore([[Payyanur]]-[[Bangalore]] Super Express Air Bus), Kattappana (Cherupuzha-[[Kattappana]] Super Fast), Kottayam ([[Konnakkad]]-[[Kottayam]] Super Fast), Kottayam ([[Neleswheram-Parappa|Parappa]]-[[Kottayam]]) Super express Air Bus, [[Palai|Pala]] (Konnakkad-Pala Limited Stop Fast Passenger) Kumily ([[Konnakkad]]-[[Kumily]]) Limited Stop Fast Passenger etc.so many buses connects [[Nileshwaram]]town and [[Kanhangad]]towns.\n\nRoads in this area were initially built to transport timber from neighboring areas. Until 1949, people depended on these roads. In 1949, primarily because of the farmers\u2019 agitations and the Munayankunnu firing incident, a new road was built from Vellore to [[Pulingome]]. This road was built to facilitate the movement of Malabar Special Police (M.S.P) in an effort to contain the Communist movements led by leaders such A.K Gopalan and E.K Nayanar.\n\nRivers in this area lacked passable bridges. The only bridges were rudimentary suspension bridges secured using iron cables stretched across the river. Even these were scarce. In rainy season, people had to use rafts made of bamboo (Pandi) for crossing rivers. This unwieldy raft was used by the students of the area to cross rivers to get to schools and back.\n\n== Migration from the South ==\n\nThe famine after World War II and the misrule of Sir. C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer incited a large scale migration of people from Travancore (South Kerala) to this area. The migration continued well into the 1970s and 80s. A vast majority of these migrants were Christians who had a completely different social and agricultural background. These hard working people brought new agricultural practices to this area. They introduced cash crops like rubber and daily staples like tapioca to the region.\n\nThe migrants also brought a new attitude to the region, one that challenged the established Janmi-Kudian feudal system. The migrants bought large tracts of land outright from the Janmies and putdown permanent crops heralding an era of prosperity for the area. The immigrants, despite their cultural and social difference, soon became an integral part of social fabric.\n\n== Facilities==\n\nUntil the mass migration of people from southern Kerala, in the 1950s to 1980s, Cherupuzha was a sleepy little village with a few shops and a rundown movie theater. The influx of farmers from the southern districts, mainly Kottayam, dramatically changed the fortunes of Cherupuzha and provided the impetus it needed to become the lively little town it is today. The proliferation of cash crops such as rubber, pepper, ginger, and cashew helped in uplifting the local economy.\n\nIn earlier times, traditional physicians (Vaidyars) took care of the sick. There were well known physicians in the area whose expertise in Ayurvedic medicines saved countless people from complex problems including snake bites. Later a government rural dispensary was set up at Pulingome. Another major hospital in the area was St Sebastian's Hospital which was set up in 1966 by the Medical Sisters of St. Joseph. Combined with the Konduparambil Nursing Home (now defunct), these institutions helped save hundreds from the ravages of malaria, which was prevalent in the area.\n\nCherupuzha in the 1970s had an upper primary school (JMUP School), a church (St. Mary's Church), couple of little nursing homes (St. Sebastian's and Konduparambil), and a Masjid. Today it boasts several educational institutions such as St. Mary's High School, St. Joseph's Higher Secondary School, Archangels public school, and hospitals in addition to graceful places of worship like the reconstructed Jerusalem Marthoma Church Cherupuzha, Little Flower Baptist Temple Kokkadavu, St. Mary's Forane Church, St. George Malankara Catholic Church, Ayyappa Temple (known as the Sabarimala of North Malabar), Salafi Masjid, Juma Musjid, and Assembly of God Church and by the late 1980s, Cherupuzha became the nerve center of trade and education east of Payyannur. It is well connected by road to, [[Nileshwar]] , Payyannur, Alakkode, Thirumeni, [[Chathamangalam (Kannur)]], Thabore, Pulingome, Chittarikkal, [[Malom]], Kokkadavu, Rajagiri, [[Kozhichal]] and beyond.\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Kannur district}}\n\n[[Category:History of Kannur district]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2018}}\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2016}}\n\nCherupuzha and its surrounding areas was ruled by many royal dynasties in the past, including the [[Mooshika dynasty]] of Ezhimala, [[Chirakkal dynasty]] of Kolathunadu, [[Tipu Sultan]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], before it became a part of the [[British Raj]].

He wrote and sang  vocals on several of the band's best-known [[Chart-topper|hits]], including \"[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]],\" \"[[Godzilla (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Godzilla]]\" and \"[[Burnin' for You]].\"\n\n==Early life==\n\nRoeser was born on [[Long Island, New York]]. His father was an accomplished [[jazz]] [[saxophone|saxophonist]], and Roeser spent a lot of time listening to jazz music as a result. Because of this, Roeser developed an interest in the melodic arts at an early age, even playing the accordion for a brief time.<ref name=Bbio1>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckdharma.com/General/Bbio1.shtml |title=Biography p.1 |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRoeser was influenced greatly by the [[British Invasion|British Invasion of 1964]], and decided to pursue rock-and-roll music.

At this time, he started to develop his own signature sound by imitating his favorite guitarists and combining their sounds with his own style. Roeser attended [[Clarkson University]] in New York, and joined a band that included later bandmate [[Albert Bouchard]]. The two played together on and off during the rest of their college career. At the end, both musicians abandoned potential degrees (Roeser's in [[Chemical Engineering]]), and decided to pursue music full-time.

The band dropped Braunstein and added new singer [[Eric Bloom]] to their lineup - and recorded under the name Stalk-Forrest Group (after a bad gig forced them to change their name) in 1970.

They signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1971, and released four albums between 1972 and 1975. By Blue \u00d6yster Cult's fifth album ''Agents of Fortune'' in 1976, Roeser proved himself as a songwriter and vocalist with the band's signature song \"[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]\". As a result, Roeser's songwriting and vocals were more prevalent on the follow-up albums ''Spectres'', ''Mirrors'', ''Cultosaurus Erectus'' and ''Fire of Unknown Origin''. Most significantly, he penned and sang on the tracks \"[[Godzilla (Blue \u00d6yster Cult song)|Godzilla]]\" and \"[[Burnin' for You]].\"\n\nIn 1982, Roeser recorded and released ''[[Flat Out (Buck Dharma album)|Flat Out]]'', his first and only solo album to date. The tracks were all composed by Roeser (some co-written with [[Richard Meltzer]], [[Neal Smith (drummer)|Neal Smith]] and Roeser's wife Sandy), with the exception of \"[[Come Softly to Me]],\" a song originally recorded by [[The Fleetwoods]]. The songs on the album were ones Roeser wanted to record with B\u00d6C, but were perceived as too poppy by the other members of the band. Singles from the album were \"Born to Rock\" and \"Your Loving Heart,\" both of which had music videos made but did not chart. The video for the former was part of an MTV promo along with [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]]'s Metalhead clip, in which Buck made a cameo appearance, as well as playing guitar on the song.\n\nRoeser and Blue \u00d6yster Cult subsequently recorded several more albums that flopped commercially, but contained several of Roeser's compositions and many tracks with him on lead vocals. The band's commercial struggles, along with the loss of original members Albert Bouchard (1982) and Allen Lanier (1985), prompted Blue \u00d6yster Cult to break up in mid 1986.\n\nIn 1985, Roeser and Bloom participated in [[Hear 'n Aid]], a project created by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for famine relief in Africa. It included many famous [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musicians. Hear n' Aid recorded the song \"Stars,\" which includes a guitar solo by Roeser. Hear n' Aid also released a compilation album which included \"Stars,\" as well as live outtakes from the participating artists.\n \nIn 1988 Blue \u00d6yster Cult released ''Imaginos'', which was recorded between 1982 and 1988. The record was originally planned to be a concept album based on Sandy Pearlman's poetry by former drummer Albert Bouchard. At the insistence of Columbia Records, it was released under the band name. Despite largely positive reviews, the album did not do well commercially, and the band was dropped by Columbia. This was the last album featuring all original members, as the Bouchards left at the end of production.<ref name=Bbio4>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckdharma.com/General/Bbio4.shtml |title=Biography p.4 |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Roeser formed The Red and the Black with John Rogers on bass and Ron Riddle on drums. The band recorded demos, but was never signed by a record company and never released an album. As a result, the band split quickly.<ref name=Bbio4/> In 1989, Roeser contributed the instrumental \"Gamera is Missing\" to the album ''Guitar's Practicing Musicians Volume 3'' (later included on the CD re-release of ''Flat Out'').\n\nAfter releasing ''Imaginos'', Roeser, Bloom and Lanier continued to tour as Blue \u00d6yster Cult, with various musicians on bass and drums. In 1992, the band wrote the score for [[Bad Channels]] and composed two original songs for [[Bad Channels (album)|its soundtrack]]. In 1994, Blue \u00d6yster Cult released ''[[Cult Classic]]'', an album containing remakes of their greatest hits.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Blue \u00d6yster Cult signed with [[Sanctuary Records]], and released two studio albums and one live album between 1998 and 2002. The band was dropped by the label in 2002. Roeser continues to tour extensively with the band, and in December 2012 reunited for a final time with all of the original members for the band's 40th Anniversary Concert.\n\nOn January 1, 2015, Roeser released \"Fight\", an original song, on his [[SoundCloud]] account. It is his first newly released material since 2001.\n\nRoeser appears on the song \"Metal Head\" by the comedy-rock group [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]] and appears in the song's video, watching television.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 2002, Roeser and his wife created \"The Dharmas\", a web-series exclusively featured on Roeser's website.

Roeser organized a benefit concert to help with the family's medical costs. Roeser, his wife Sandy, drummer [[John Miceli]] and bassist Danny Miranda played the concert under the name \"Buck Dharma Band\".

{"title_page": "ClearType", "text_new": "'''ClearType''' is  Microsoft's implementation of [[subpixel rendering]] technology in rendering text in a [[font]] system. ClearType attempts to improve the appearance of text on certain types of [[computer display]] screens by sacrificing color fidelity for additional intensity variation. This trade-off is asserted to work well on [[LCD]] [[flat panel]] monitors.\n\nClearType was first announced at the November 1998 [[COMDEX]] exhibition. The technology was first introduced in software in January 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=1135|title=First ClearType screens posted|publisher=Microsoft Typography|date=2000-01-26|accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> as an always-on feature of [[Microsoft Reader]], which was released to  the public in August 2000.\n\nClearType was significantly changed with the introduction of [[DirectWrite]] in [[Windows 7]].<ref name=ails>{{cite web|last1=Giannattasio|first1=Tom|title=The Ails Of Typographic Anti-Aliasing|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/|website=Smashing Magazine|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Word 2013]] stopped using ClearType, because it \"depends critically on the color of the background pixels\", which made it difficult to give good animation performance on arbitrary backgrounds.<ref name=Word/>\n\n==Background==\nComputer displays where the positions of individual pixels are permanently fixed{{snd}} such as most modern flat panel displays{{snd}} can show saw-tooth edges when displaying small, high-contrast graphic elements, such as text. ClearType uses spatial [[anti-aliasing]] at the subpixel level to reduce visible artifacts on such displays when text is rendered, making the text appear \"smoother\" and less jagged. ClearType also uses very heavy font hinting to force the font to fit into the pixel grid. This increases edge contrast and readability of small fonts at the expense of font rendering fidelity and has been criticized by graphic designers for making different fonts look similar.\n\nLike most other types of subpixel rendering, ClearType involves a compromise, sacrificing one aspect of image quality (color or ''[[chrominance]]'' detail) for another (light and dark or ''[[luminance]]'' detail). The compromise can improve text appearance when luminance detail is more important than chrominance.\n\nOnly user and system applications render the application of ClearType. ClearType does not alter other graphic display elements (including text already in [[bitmap]]s). For example, ClearType enhancement renders text on the screen in [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]], but text placed in a bitmapped image in a program such as [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] is not. In theory, the method (called \"RGB Decimation\" internally) can enhance the [[anti-aliasing]] of any digital image.<ref>Betrisey et al., \"Displaced Filtering for Patterned Displays\", Proc. Society for Information Display Symposium, 2000</ref>\n\nClearType is not used when printing text. Most printers already use such small pixels that aliasing is rarely a problem, and they don't have the addressable fixed subpixels ClearType requires. Nor does ClearType affect text stored in files. ClearType only applies any processing to the text while it is being rendered onto the screen.\n\nClearType was invented in the Microsoft e-Books team by Bert Keely and Greg Hitchcock.  It was then analyzed by researchers in the company, and signal processing expert [[John Platt (Principal Researcher)|John Platt]] designed an improved version of the algorithm.<ref>Platt, J.C., \"[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68972/optfilt.pdf Optimal Filtering for Patterned Displays]\", IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 7(7), 2000, pp. 179-180</ref>  [[Dick Brass]], a Vice President at Microsoft from 1997 to 2004, complained that the company was slow in moving ClearType to market in the portable computing field.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/opinion/04brass.html?pagewanted=1&ref=opinion Microsoft\u2019s Creative Destruction]</ref>\n\n==How ClearType works==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=subpixel rendering|date=August 2014}}\n\nNormally, the software in a computer treats the computer\u2019s display screen as a rectangular array of square, indivisible [[pixel]]s, each of which has an intensity and color that are determined by the blending of three [[primary color]]s: red, green, and blue. However, actual display hardware usually implements each pixel as a group of three adjacent, independent ''[[subpixel]]s,'' each of which displays a different primary color. Thus, on a real computer display, each pixel is actually composed of separate red, green, and blue subpixels. For example, if a flat-panel display is examined under a magnifying glass, the pixels may appear as follows:\n\n[[Image:27 subpixels.svg|center|Subpixels|thumb]]\n\nIn the illustration above, there are nine pixels but 27 subpixels.\n\nIf the computer controlling the display knows the exact position and color of all the subpixels on the screen, it can take advantage of this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only one or two of the subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).\n\n[[Image:Antialias-vrs-Cromapixel.svg|center|frame|1) A diagonal line on a 1-bit display. 2) Grayscale [[anti-aliasing]]. 3) Identical to 1, but on a color monitor. 4) Rendered with direct control of each color subpixel. 5) Smaller version of 1-4. 6) 1 pixel lines without and with [[anti-aliasing]].]]\n\nClearType uses this method to improve the smoothness of text. When the elements of a type character are smaller than a full pixel, ClearType lights only the appropriate subpixels of each full pixel in order to more closely follow the outlines of that character. Text rendered with ClearType looks \u201csmoother\u201d than text rendered without it, provided that the pixel layout of the display screen exactly matches what ClearType expects.\n\nThe following picture shows a 4\u00d7 enlargement of the word ''Wikipedia'' rendered using ClearType. The word was originally rendered using a [[Times New Roman]] 12 [[Point (typography)|pt]] font.\n\n[[Image:Wikipedia ClearType.png|center|frame|The word \"Wikipedia\" rendered using ClearType]]\n\nIn this magnified view, it becomes clear that, while the overall smoothness of the text seems to improve, there is also color fringing of the text.\n\n[[Image:ClearTypePixels.svg|thumb|center|283px| (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType]]\n\nAn extreme close-up of a color display shows (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType. Note the changes in subpixel intensity that are used to increase effective resolution when ClearType is enabled{{snd}} without ClearType, all sub-pixels of a given pixel have the same intensity.\n\n[[Image:Cleartype-vs-Standard-Antialiasing.gif|center|(a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType]]\n\nIn the above lines of text, when the orange circle is shown, all the text in the frame is rendered using ClearType (RGB subpixel rendering); when the orange circle is absent all the text is rendered using normal (full pixel greyscale) [[anti-aliasing]].\n\n==Human vision and cognition ==\nClearType and similar technologies work on the theory that variations in intensity are more noticeable than variations in color.\n\n===Expert opinion===\nIn a [[MSDN]] article, Microsoft acknowledges that \"[te]xt that is rendered with ClearType can also appear significantly different when viewed by individuals with varying levels of color sensitivity. Some individuals can detect slight differences in color better than others.\"<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970267.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Registry Settings]</ref> This opinion is shared by font designer Thomas Phinney (former CEO of [[FontLab]], also formerly with [[Adobe Systems]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-designers/thomas-phinney.html | title=Thomas W.

ClearType also yielded higher readability judgments and lower ratings of mental fatigue.\"<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1889/1.1831776 | title=47.4: Empirical Evaluation of User Responses to Reading Text Rendered Using ClearType\u2122 Technologies | journal=SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers | date=2001 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=1205 | first=Richard A. | last=Tyrrell}}</ref> A 2002 study on 24 users conducted by the same researchers from Clemson University also found that \"Participants were significantly more accurate at identifying words with ClearType\u2122 than without ClearType\u2122.\"\n\nAccording to a 2006 study, at the University of Texas at Austin by Dillon et al., ClearType \"may not be universally beneficial\".  The study notes that maximum benefit may be seen when the information worker is spending large proportions of their time reading text (which is not necessarily the case for the majority of computer users today).  Additionally, over one third of the study participants experienced some disadvantage when using ClearType.  Whether ClearType, or other rendering, should be used is very subjective and it must be the choice of the individual, with the report recommending \"to allow users to disable [ClearType] if they find it produces effects other than improved performance\".<ref>Dillon, A., Kleinman, L., Choi, G.

In a 2004 study, for instance, Lee Gugerty, a psychology professor at Clemson University, in South Carolina, measured a 17 percent improvement in word recognition accuracy with ClearType. Gugerty\u2019s group also showed, in a sentence comprehension study, that ClearType boosted reading speed by 5 percent and comprehension by 2 percent. Similarly, in a study published in 2007, psychologist Andrew Dillon at the University of Texas at Austin found that when subjects were asked to scan a spreadsheet and pick out certain information, they did those tasks 7 percent faster with ClearType.\"<ref>Kevin Larson (May 2007) \"[https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-technology-of-text The Technology of Text]\", ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]''</ref>\n\n==Display requirements==\nClearType and allied technologies require display hardware with fixed pixels and subpixels. More precisely, the positions of the pixels and subpixels on the screen must be exactly known to the computer to which it is connected. This is the case for flat-panel displays, on which the positions of the pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the screen itself. Almost all flat panels have a perfectly rectangular array of square pixels, each of which contains three rectangular subpixels in the three primary colors, with the normal ordering being red, green, and blue, arranged in vertical bands. ClearType assumes this arrangement of pixels when rendering text.\n\nClearType does not work properly with flat-panel displays that are operated at resolutions other than their \u201cnative\u201d resolutions, since only the native resolution corresponds exactly to the actual positions of pixels on the screen of the display.\n\nIf a display does not have the type of fixed pixels that ClearType expects, text rendered with ClearType enabled actually looks worse than type rendered without it. Some flat panels have unusual pixel arrangements, with the colors in a different order, or with the subpixels positioned differently (in three horizontal bands, or in other ways). ClearType needs to be manually tuned for use with such displays (see below).\n\nClearType will not work as intended on displays that have no fixed pixel positions, such as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, however it will still have some antialiasing effect and may be preferable to some users as compared to non-anti-aliased type.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|title=ClearType FAQ|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeFAQ.mspx|website=Microsoft|accessdate=19 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624222557/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeFAQ.mspx |archivedate=24 June 2015|date=19 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Sensitivity to display orientation==\nBecause ClearType utilizes the physical layout of the red, green and blue [[pigments]] of the LCD screen, it is sensitive to the orientation of the display.\n\nClearType in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Windows XP]] currently supports the [[RGB]] and [[BGR (subpixels)|BGR]] sub pixel structures. Rotated displays, in which the subpixels are stacked vertically rather than arranged horizontally, are ''not'' currently supported. Using ClearType on these display configurations will actually reduce the display quality. The best option for users of Windows XP having rotated LCD displays ([[Microsoft Tablet PC|Tablet PCs]] or swivel-stand LCD displays) is using regular [[anti-aliasing]], or switching off font-smoothing altogether.\n\nThe software developer documentation for [[Windows CE]] states that ClearType for rotated screens is supported on that platform.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms901093.aspx Working with ClearType Fonts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical sub pixel structures are not supported in Windows XP.<ref>[http://www.brandonfurtwangler.com/?p=54 Tablets and cleartype, and a requested feature of Avalon at Brandon Furtwangler blog]</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\n* [[Windows XP]] (off by default)\n* [[Windows Vista]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows 7]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows 8]]: Only used in Windows 8 Desktop and all desktop apps<ref name=\"something\">[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20120303/cleartype-takes-a-back-seat-for-windows-8-metro/ ClearType takes a back seat for Windows 8 Metro]</ref>\n* [[Windows 10]]: Only used in Win32 apps and Win32 system features, not Universal Windows Platform.\n* [[Internet Explorer 7]] and later (on by default)\n* [[Microsoft Office 2007]] and 2010 (on by default)\n* [[Windows Live Messenger]] (on by default)\n* [[Microsoft Reader]]\n\nClearType is also an integrated component of the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] text-rendering engine.\n\n===ClearType in GDI===\nClearType can be globally enabled or disabled for [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] applications. A control panel applet is available to let the users tune the GDI ClearType settings. The GDI implementation of ClearType does not support sub-pixel positioning.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Overview]</ref>\n\n===ClearType tuning===\nSome versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], as supplied, allow ClearType to be turned on or off, with no adjustment; other versions allow tuning of the ClearType parameters. A Microsoft ClearType tuner utility is available for free download for Windows versions lacking this facility.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx | title = Microsoft's ClearType Tuner PowerToy | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> If ClearType is disabled in the operating system, applications with their own ClearType controls can still support it. [[Microsoft Reader]] (for [[e-book]]s) has its own ClearType tuner.\n\n===ClearType in WPF===\nAll text in [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType. There are separate ClearType registry settings for GDI and WPF applications, but by default the WPF entries are absent, and the GDI values are used in their absence. WPF registry entries can be tuned using the instructions<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/text/archive/2006/10/18/tips-for-improving-your-wpf-text-rendering-experience.aspx Tips for improving your WPF text rendering experience]</ref> from the MSDN WPF Text Blog.\n\nClearType in WPF supports sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction [[anti-aliasing]] and [[hardware acceleration]]. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx MSDN Library : .NET Development : WPF : ClearType Overview]</ref> The extent to which this is supported is dependent on the [[video card]]. [[DirectX]] 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), [[alpha blending]] (application of [[anti-aliasing]]), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2&nbsp;MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics{{snd}} including video{{snd}} can also be done with no computation effort on the part of the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card.  Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5&nbsp;MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.\n\n===ClearType in DirectWrite===\n\nAs pixel densities of displays improved and more high DPI screens became available, colored subpixel rendering became less of a necessity according to Microsoft. Also Windows tablet user interfaces evolved to support vertical screen orientations where the LCD color stripes would run horizontally. The original colored ClearType subpixel rendering was tuned to work optimally with horizontal orientation LCD displays where RGB or BGR stripes run vertically. For these reasons, DirectWrite which is the next-generation text rendering API from Microsoft moved away from color-aware ClearType. The font rendering engine in [[DirectWrite]] supports a different version of ClearType with only greyscale [[anti-aliasing]] <ref> [Office 2013: Further Evidence of the Demise of ClearType?

The reasons invoked are, in the words of Murray Sargent: \"There is a problem with ClearType: it depends critically on the color of the background pixels. This isn\u2019t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (the blinking vertical line at the text insertion point) glides from one position to the next as you type. Jerking movement just isn\u2019t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth.

ClearType attempts to improve the appearance of text on certain types of [[computer display]] screens by sacrificing color fidelity for additional intensity variation. This trade-off is asserted to work well on [[LCD]] [[flat panel]] monitors.\n\nClearType was first announced at the November 1998 [[COMDEX]] exhibition. The technology was first introduced in software in January 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=1135|title=First ClearType screens posted|publisher=Microsoft Typography|date=2000-01-26|accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> as an always-on feature of [[Microsoft Reader]], which was released to  the public in August 2000.\n\nClearType was significantly changed with the introduction of [[DirectWrite]] in [[Windows 7]].<ref name=ails>{{cite web|last1=Giannattasio|first1=Tom|title=The Ails Of Typographic Anti-Aliasing|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/|website=Smashing Magazine|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Word 2013]] stopped using ClearType, because it \"depends critically on the color of the background pixels\", which made it difficult to give good animation performance on arbitrary backgrounds.<ref name=Word/>\n\n==Background==\nComputer displays where the positions of individual pixels are permanently fixed{{snd}} such as most modern flat panel displays{{snd}} can show saw-tooth edges when displaying small, high-contrast graphic elements, such as text. ClearType uses spatial [[anti-aliasing]] at the subpixel level to reduce visible artifacts on such displays when text is rendered, making the text appear \"smoother\" and less jagged. ClearType also uses very heavy font hinting to force the font to fit into the pixel grid. This increases edge contrast and readability of small fonts at the expense of font rendering fidelity and has been criticized by graphic designers for making different fonts look similar.\n\nLike most other types of subpixel rendering, ClearType involves a compromise, sacrificing one aspect of image quality (color or ''[[chrominance]]'' detail) for another (light and dark or ''[[luminance]]'' detail). The compromise can improve text appearance when luminance detail is more important than chrominance.\n\nOnly user and system applications render the application of ClearType. ClearType does not alter other graphic display elements (including text already in [[bitmap]]s). For example, ClearType enhancement renders text on the screen in [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]], but text placed in a bitmapped image in a program such as [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] is not. In theory, the method (called \"RGB Decimation\" internally) can enhance the [[anti-aliasing]] of any digital image.<ref>Betrisey et al., \"Displaced Filtering for Patterned Displays\", Proc. Society for Information Display Symposium, 2000</ref>\n\nClearType is not used when printing text. Most printers already use such small pixels that aliasing is rarely a problem, and they don't have the addressable fixed subpixels ClearType requires. Nor does ClearType affect text stored in files. ClearType only applies any processing to the text while it is being rendered onto the screen.\n\nClearType was invented in the Microsoft e-Books team by Bert Keely and Greg Hitchcock.  It was then analyzed by researchers in the company, and signal processing expert [[John Platt (Principal Researcher)|John Platt]] designed an improved version of the algorithm.<ref>Platt, J.C., \"[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68972/optfilt.pdf Optimal Filtering for Patterned Displays]\", IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 7(7), 2000, pp. 179-180</ref>  [[Dick Brass]], a Vice President at Microsoft from 1997 to 2004, complained that the company was slow in moving ClearType to market in the portable computing field.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/opinion/04brass.html?pagewanted=1&ref=opinion Microsoft\u2019s Creative Destruction]</ref>\n\n==How ClearType works==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=subpixel rendering|date=August 2014}}\n\nNormally, the software in a computer treats the computer\u2019s display screen as a rectangular array of square, indivisible [[pixel]]s, each of which has an intensity and color that are determined by the blending of three [[primary color]]s: red, green, and blue. However, actual display hardware usually implements each pixel as a group of three adjacent, independent ''[[subpixel]]s,'' each of which displays a different primary color. Thus, on a real computer display, each pixel is actually composed of separate red, green, and blue subpixels. For example, if a flat-panel display is examined under a magnifying glass, the pixels may appear as follows:\n\n[[Image:27 subpixels.svg|center|Subpixels|thumb]]\n\nIn the illustration above, there are nine pixels but 27 subpixels.\n\nIf the computer controlling the display knows the exact position and color of all the subpixels on the screen, it can take advantage of this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only one or two of the subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).\n\n[[Image:Antialias-vrs-Cromapixel.svg|center|frame|1) A diagonal line on a 1-bit display. 2) Grayscale [[anti-aliasing]]. 3) Identical to 1, but on a color monitor. 4) Rendered with direct control of each color subpixel. 5) Smaller version of 1-4. 6) 1 pixel lines without and with [[anti-aliasing]].]]\n\nClearType uses this method to improve the smoothness of text. When the elements of a type character are smaller than a full pixel, ClearType lights only the appropriate subpixels of each full pixel in order to more closely follow the outlines of that character. Text rendered with ClearType looks \u201csmoother\u201d than text rendered without it, provided that the pixel layout of the display screen exactly matches what ClearType expects.\n\nThe following picture shows a 4\u00d7 enlargement of the word ''Wikipedia'' rendered using ClearType. The word was originally rendered using a [[Times New Roman]] 12 [[Point (typography)|pt]] font.\n\n[[Image:Wikipedia ClearType.png|center|frame|The word \"Wikipedia\" rendered using ClearType]]\n\nIn this magnified view, it becomes clear that, while the overall smoothness of the text seems to improve, there is also color fringing of the text.\n\n[[Image:ClearTypePixels.svg|thumb|center|283px| (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType]]\n\nAn extreme close-up of a color display shows (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType. Note the changes in subpixel intensity that are used to increase effective resolution when ClearType is enabled{{snd}} without ClearType, all sub-pixels of a given pixel have the same intensity.\n\n[[Image:Cleartype-vs-Standard-Antialiasing.gif|center|(a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType]]\n\nIn the above lines of text, when the orange circle is shown, all the text in the frame is rendered using ClearType (RGB subpixel rendering); when the orange circle is absent all the text is rendered using normal (full pixel greyscale) [[anti-aliasing]].\n\n==Human vision and cognition ==\nClearType and similar technologies work on the theory that variations in intensity are more noticeable than variations in color.\n\n===Expert opinion===\nIn a [[MSDN]] article, Microsoft acknowledges that \"[te]xt that is rendered with ClearType can also appear significantly different when viewed by individuals with varying levels of color sensitivity. Some individuals can detect slight differences in color better than others.\"<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970267.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Registry Settings]</ref> This opinion is shared by font designer Thomas Phinney (former CEO of [[FontLab]], also formerly with [[Adobe Systems]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-designers/thomas-phinney.html | title=Thomas W.

Many people are fine with the colors of ClearType, even at 96 dpi, but a few aren\u2019t\u2026 To my eyes and at 96 dpi, Method C doesn\u2019t read as well as Method A.

ClearType also yielded higher readability judgments and lower ratings of mental fatigue.\"<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1889/1.1831776 | title=47.4: Empirical Evaluation of User Responses to Reading Text Rendered Using ClearType\u2122 Technologies | journal=SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers | date=2001 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=1205 | first=Richard A. | last=Tyrrell}}</ref> A 2002 study on 24 users conducted by the same researchers from Clemson University also found that \"Participants were significantly more accurate at identifying words with ClearType\u2122 than without ClearType\u2122.\"\n\nAccording to a 2006 study, at the University of Texas at Austin by Dillon et al., ClearType \"may not be universally beneficial\".  The study notes that maximum benefit may be seen when the information worker is spending large proportions of their time reading text (which is not necessarily the case for the majority of computer users today).  Additionally, over one third of the study participants experienced some disadvantage when using ClearType.  Whether ClearType, or other rendering, should be used is very subjective and it must be the choice of the individual, with the report recommending \"to allow users to disable [ClearType] if they find it produces effects other than improved performance\".<ref>Dillon, A., Kleinman, L., Choi, G.

In a 2004 study, for instance, Lee Gugerty, a psychology professor at Clemson University, in South Carolina, measured a 17 percent improvement in word recognition accuracy with ClearType. Gugerty\u2019s group also showed, in a sentence comprehension study, that ClearType boosted reading speed by 5 percent and comprehension by 2 percent. Similarly, in a study published in 2007, psychologist Andrew Dillon at the University of Texas at Austin found that when subjects were asked to scan a spreadsheet and pick out certain information, they did those tasks 7 percent faster with ClearType.\"<ref>Kevin Larson (May 2007) \"[https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-technology-of-text The Technology of Text]\", ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]''</ref>\n\n==Display requirements==\nClearType and allied technologies require display hardware with fixed pixels and subpixels. More precisely, the positions of the pixels and subpixels on the screen must be exactly known to the computer to which it is connected. This is the case for flat-panel displays, on which the positions of the pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the screen itself. Almost all flat panels have a perfectly rectangular array of square pixels, each of which contains three rectangular subpixels in the three primary colors, with the normal ordering being red, green, and blue, arranged in vertical bands. ClearType assumes this arrangement of pixels when rendering text.\n\nClearType does not work properly with flat-panel displays that are operated at resolutions other than their \u201cnative\u201d resolutions, since only the native resolution corresponds exactly to the actual positions of pixels on the screen of the display.\n\nIf a display does not have the type of fixed pixels that ClearType expects, text rendered with ClearType enabled actually looks worse than type rendered without it. Some flat panels have unusual pixel arrangements, with the colors in a different order, or with the subpixels positioned differently (in three horizontal bands, or in other ways). ClearType needs to be manually tuned for use with such displays (see below).\n\nClearType will not work as intended on displays that have no fixed pixel positions, such as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, however it will still have some antialiasing effect and may be preferable to some users as compared to non-anti-aliased type.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|title=ClearType FAQ|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeFAQ.mspx|website=Microsoft|accessdate=19 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624222557/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeFAQ.mspx |archivedate=24 June 2015|date=19 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Sensitivity to display orientation==\nBecause ClearType utilizes the physical layout of the red, green and blue [[pigments]] of the LCD screen, it is sensitive to the orientation of the display.\n\nClearType in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Windows XP]] currently supports the [[RGB]] and [[BGR (subpixels)|BGR]] sub pixel structures. Rotated displays, in which the subpixels are stacked vertically rather than arranged horizontally, are ''not'' currently supported. Using ClearType on these display configurations will actually reduce the display quality. The best option for users of Windows XP having rotated LCD displays ([[Microsoft Tablet PC|Tablet PCs]] or swivel-stand LCD displays) is using regular [[anti-aliasing]], or switching off font-smoothing altogether.\n\nThe software developer documentation for [[Windows CE]] states that ClearType for rotated screens is supported on that platform.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms901093.aspx Working with ClearType Fonts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical sub pixel structures are not supported in Windows XP.<ref>[http://www.brandonfurtwangler.com/?p=54 Tablets and cleartype, and a requested feature of Avalon at Brandon Furtwangler blog]</ref>\n\n==Implementations==\n* [[Windows XP]] (off by default)\n* [[Windows Vista]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows 7]] (on by default)\n* [[Windows 8]]: Only used in Windows 8 Desktop and all desktop apps<ref name=\"something\">[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20120303/cleartype-takes-a-back-seat-for-windows-8-metro/ ClearType takes a back seat for Windows 8 Metro]</ref>\n* [[Windows 10]]: Only used in Win32 apps and Win32 system features, not Universal Windows Platform.\n* [[Internet Explorer 7]] and later (on by default)\n* [[Microsoft Office 2007]] and 2010 (on by default)\n* [[Windows Live Messenger]] (on by default)\n* [[Microsoft Reader]]\n\nClearType is also an integrated component of the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] text-rendering engine.\n\n===ClearType in GDI===\nClearType can be globally enabled or disabled for [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] applications. A control panel applet is available to let the users tune the GDI ClearType settings. The GDI implementation of ClearType does not support sub-pixel positioning.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx Windows Presentation Foundation ClearType Overview]</ref>\n\n===ClearType tuning===\nSome versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], as supplied, allow ClearType to be turned on or off, with no adjustment; other versions allow tuning of the ClearType parameters. A Microsoft ClearType tuner utility is available for free download for Windows versions lacking this facility.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx | title = Microsoft's ClearType Tuner PowerToy | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> If ClearType is disabled in the operating system, applications with their own ClearType controls can still support it. [[Microsoft Reader]] (for [[e-book]]s) has its own ClearType tuner.\n\n===ClearType in WPF===\nAll text in [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType. There are separate ClearType registry settings for GDI and WPF applications, but by default the WPF entries are absent, and the GDI values are used in their absence. WPF registry entries can be tuned using the instructions<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/text/archive/2006/10/18/tips-for-improving-your-wpf-text-rendering-experience.aspx Tips for improving your WPF text rendering experience]</ref> from the MSDN WPF Text Blog.\n\nClearType in WPF supports sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction [[anti-aliasing]] and [[hardware acceleration]]. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms749295.aspx MSDN Library : .NET Development : WPF : ClearType Overview]</ref> The extent to which this is supported is dependent on the [[video card]]. [[DirectX]] 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), [[alpha blending]] (application of [[anti-aliasing]]), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2&nbsp;MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics{{snd}} including video{{snd}} can also be done with no computation effort on the part of the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card.  Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5&nbsp;MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.\n\n===ClearType in DirectWrite===\n\nAs pixel densities of displays improved and more high DPI screens became available, colored subpixel rendering became less of a necessity according to Microsoft. Also Windows tablet user interfaces evolved to support vertical screen orientations where the LCD color stripes would run horizontally. The original colored ClearType subpixel rendering was tuned to work optimally with horizontal orientation LCD displays where RGB or BGR stripes run vertically.

The reasons invoked are, in the words of Murray Sargent: \"There is a problem with ClearType: it depends critically on the color of the background pixels. This isn\u2019t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (the blinking vertical line at the text insertion point) glides from one position to the next as you type. Jerking movement just isn\u2019t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth. And that rules out ClearType in animated scenarios at least with present generation hardware. And in future scenarios, screens will have sufficiently high resolution that gray-scale [[anti-aliasing]] should suffice.\"<ref name=\"Word\">{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/murrays/archive/2014/05/31/crisp-text-display.aspx|title=Crisp Text Display|last=Sargent|first=Murray|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530145657/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/murrays/archive/2014/05/31/crisp-text-display.aspx|archive-date=2015-05-30|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor the same reasons related to animation performance and vertical screen orientations where the colored RGB/BGR ClearType antialiasing would be a problem, the color-aware version of ClearType was abandoned in Metro-style apps platform of Windows 8 (and Universal Windows Platform of Windows 10).<ref>[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150129-00/?p=44803 Color-aware ClearType requires access to fixed background pixels, which is a problem if you don\u2019t know what the background pixels are, or if they aren\u2019t fixed]</ref><ref name=\"something\"/>, including the Start menu and everything not using classic Win32 APIs (GDI/GDI+).\n\n==Patents==\nClearType is a [[registered trademark]] and Microsoft claims protection under the following U.S. [[patent]]s:<ref name=\"msip\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/iplicensing/productDetail.aspx?productTitle=ClearType |title=Microsoft Intellectual Property and Licensing: ClearType |accessdate=2008-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113030909/http://www.microsoft.com/iplicensing/productDetail.aspx?productTitle=ClearType |archivedate=January 13, 2009 }}\n</ref><ref name=\"cleartype_expl\">{{cite web|url=http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html|date=2007-06-01|accessdate=2009-04-09|title=ClearType Patents, FreeType and the Unix Desktop: an explanation|author=David Turner}}</ref>\n\n* Subpixel rendering:\n** {{US patent|6188385}} \u2013 ''Method and apparatus for displaying images such as text''\n** {{US patent|6219025}} \u2013 ''Mapping image data samples to pixel sub-components on a striped display device''\n** {{US patent|6239783}} \u2013 ''Weighted mapping of image data samples to pixel sub-components on a display device''\n** {{US patent|6307566}} \u2013 ''Methods and apparatus for performing image rendering and rasterization operations''\n* Complex color filtering:\n** {{US patent|6225973}} \u2013 ''Mapping samples of foreground/background color image data to pixel sub-components''\n** {{US patent|6243070}} \u2013 ''Method and apparatus for detecting and reducing color artifacts in images''\n** {{US patent|6393145}} \u2013 ''Methods apparatus and data structures for enhancing the resolution of images to be rendered on patterned display devices''\n** {{US patent|6973210}} \u2013 ''Filtering image data to obtain samples mapped to pixel sub-components of a display device''\n** {{US patent|7085412}} \u2013 ''Filtering image data to obtain samples mapped to pixel sub-components of a display device''\n* Subpixel font hinting and layout:\n** {{US patent|6421054}} \u2013 ''Methods and apparatus for performing grid fitting and hinting operations''\n** {{US patent|6282327}} \u2013 ''Maintaining advance widths of existing characters that have been resolution enhanced''\n* ClearType tuning:\n** {{US patent|6624828}} \u2013 ''Method and apparatus for improving the quality of displayed images through the use of user reference information''\n\n==Other uses of the ClearType brand ==\nThe ClearType name was also used to refer to the screens of [[Microsoft Surface]] tablets.

They first entered Thailand from Burma at the turn of the 20th-century, many having fled the decades-long civil war in Burma.<ref name=Kammerer>{{cite journal|last=Kammerer|first=Cornelia Ann|journal=Gle Rubin Virtual Reference Library|year=1996|volume=5|series=East and South East Asia|pages=11\u201313|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=cuny_hunter&tabID=T003&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=3&contentSet=GALE%7CCX3458000748&&docId=GALE%7CCX3458000748&docType=GALE|accessdate=30 April 2012|title=GALE search|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref name=Levy>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Jonathan|title=The Akha and Modernization; A Quasi Legal Perspective|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhamodernization.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Population distribution and indigenous status ==\n[[File:Akha laos 11 03d.jpg|thumb|An Akha girl in Laos]]\nAkha live in villages in the mountains of southwest China, eastern [[Myanmar]], western [[Laos]], northwestern [[Vietnam]], and [[northern Thailand]]. In all these countries they are an ethnic minority. The population of the Akha today is roughly 400,000. A decline in village size in Thailand since the 1930s has been noted and attributed to the deteriorating ecological and economic situation in the mountains.<ref name=Thailine>{{cite web|url=http://www.thailine.com/thailand/english/hill-e/akha-e.htm|title=Akha|work=The Hilltribes of Thailand|publisher=Thailand Online|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha are often classified by the Chinese government as part of the [[Hani people|Hani]], an official national minority. The Akha are closely related to the Hani, but consider themselves a distinct group and often resist being subsumed under that identity.<ref name=Hilltribe>{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> In Thailand, they are classified as one of the six [[hill tribes]], a term used for all of the various tribal peoples who migrated from China and Tibet over the past few centuries and who now inhabit the dense forests on the borders between Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.<ref name=Levy />\n\nThe Akha are not always treated or addressed as equals by the people whose countries they now inhabit. Speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Myanmar and Thailand refer to them as \"gaw\" or \"ekaw\" (ikaw/ikho), terms which the Akha view as derogatory. In Laos the colloquial term used by Tai speakers to refer to the Akha is \"kho\" (ko), often prefaced by the word \"kha\", which means \"slave.\"<ref name=Kammerer />\n\n== Language ==\n[[File:Akha women.jpg|thumb|Akha women c. 1900.]]\nCalled \"Avkavdawv,\" meaning \"[[Akha language]],\" by its native speakers, Akha is a tonal language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. The vast majority of Akha speakers can understand the ''jeu g\u2019oe'' (\"jer way\") dialect spoken in southern China, Thailand, and Myanmar.<ref name=Kammerer /> Some basic and systematic variations in regional dialects of Akha are discussed by Paul Lewis in his ''Akha-English-Thai Dictionary''. Very few dialects of Akha do not share mutual intelligibility. The Akha have no written language, but there are several competing scripts that have been written by missionaries and other foreigners.<ref name=Hilltribe />\n\n== Akha villages and culture ==\n[[File:Maejantai Chiang Rai province 01.JPG|thumb|300px|The village of Mae Chan Tai in [[Mae Suai District]], Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, is a more modern village. Note the large coffee drying platforms.]]\nDue to rapid social and economic changes in the regions the Akha inhabit, particularly the introduction of Western modes of capitalism, attempts to continue many of the traditional aspects of Akha life are increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges, Akha people practice many elements of their traditional culture with much success.\n\nAkha society lacks a strict system of social class and is considered [[egalitarian]]. Respect is typically accorded with age and experience. Ties of patrilineal kinship and marriage alliance bind the Akha within and between communities.<ref name=Kammerer /> Village structures may vary widely from the strictly traditional to Westernized, depending on their proximity to modern towns. Like many of the hill tribes, the Akha build their villages at higher elevations in the mountains.<ref name=Akha>{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Akha |url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhaoverview.html|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAkha dwellings are traditionally constructed of logs, bamboo, and thatch and are of two types: \"low houses\", built on the ground, and \"high houses\", built on stilts. The semi-nomadic Akha, at least those who have not been moved to permanent village sites, typically do not build their houses as permanent residences and will often move their villages. Some say that this gives the dwellings a deceptively fragile and flimsy appearance, although they are quite well-built as proved over generations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indigenous Peoples of the World - The Akha|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Akha |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nEntrances to all Akha villages are fitted with a wooden gate adorned with elaborate carvings on both sides depicting imagery of men and women. It is known as a \"spirit gate\". It marks the division between the inside of the village, the domain of man and domesticated animals, and the outside, the realm of spirits and wildlife. The gates function to ward off evil spirits and to entice favorable ones. Carvings can be seen on the roofs of the villager's houses as a second measure to control the flow of spirits.\n\nHouses are segregated by gender, with specific areas for men as well as a common space. This divide is said to mimic the function of the gate.<ref name=Hilltribe /> Another important feature found in most Akha villages is a tall four-posted village swing which is used in an annual ancestor offering related to the fertility of rice. The swing is built annually by an elder called a ''dzoeuh mah''.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe />\n<gallery>\nFile:Gate leading to the akha hilltribe village.jpg|An Akha \"Spirit Gate\" in Thailand\nFile:Akha Hut.JPG|Akha hut\nFile:Akha fishing.JPG|Akha fishing\nFile:Akha hilltribe, Chiang Rai Province P1110690.JPG| Akha, Chiang Rai Province\nFile:Akha village.jpg|An Akha village, with traditional thatched roofs, in northern [[Thailand]]\nFile:Akha Funeral1.JPG|Akha funeral ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n=== Traditional economy ===\n[[Image:Akha man with opium pipe.jpg|thumb|300 px|Akha man with [[opium pipe]] (1979)]]\nThe traditional form of subsistence for the Akha people has been, and remains, agriculture. The Akha grow a variety of crops including soybeans and vegetables. Rice is the most significant crop and is prominent in much of Akha culture and ritual. Most Akha plant dry-land rice, which depends solely on rainfall for moisture, but in some villages irrigation has been built to water [[paddy field]]s. Historically, some Akha villages cultivated [[opium]], but production diminished after the Thai government banned its cultivation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=Jim|title=Meet the Akha|year=1996|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|location=Bangkok|isbn=9748496562|pages=113}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha have traditionally employed [[slash and burn]] agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, there is usually no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture has contributed to the Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.<ref name=Akha />\n\nIn addition to their agricultural work, the Akha raise livestock including pigs, chickens, ducks, goats, cattle, and water buffalo to supplement their diets and to use for their secondary products. Children usually herd the animals. Akha women gather plants from the surrounding forests as well as eggs and insects the Akha will occasionally eat or use for medicinal purposes. The women and the men will often fish in the local lakes and streams. Some villages construct bee gums with the hope that a colony will nest there and their honey subsequently harvested.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe /><ref name=Goodman>{{cite book |last=Goodman|first=Jim|title=Meet the Akha|year=1996|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|location=Bangkok |isbn=9748496562|pages=113\u2013115}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha are skilled hunters. Hunting is a male activity and a very popular one. It is a favorite pastime and a means of obtaining food. The barking deer is, perhaps, their favorite prey. Guns obtained from trading in the larger towns have begun to replace the use of crossbows in hunting.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Goodman />\n\n===Belief system===\n{{see also|Christianity in Ahka Villages}}\n[[File:Woman with child in Thailand..jpg|thumb|Akha woman with child (Thailand)]]\n[[File:Akha couple.JPG|thumb|Husband carrying the stem of a banana plant, to be fed to pigs]]\nAkha religion\u2014''zahv''\u2014is often described as a mixture of [[animism]] and ancestor worship that emphasizes the Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It might be said that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.<ref name=Tooker>{{cite journal|last=Tooker|first=Deborah|title=Identity Systems of Highland Burma: 'Belief', Akha Zan, and a Critique of Interiorized Notions of Ethno-Religious Identity|journal=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=27|pages=799\u2013819|jstor=2804175}}</ref>\n\nThe annual ritual cycle consists of nine or twelve ancestor offerings, rice rituals, and other rites such as the building of the village gates. Many Akha rituals and festivals serve to seek \"blessings\" (''guivlahav'') from ancestors, which are according to the ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures'', \"...fertility and health in people, rice, and domesticated animals.\"<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Belief>{{cite web|title=The Akha Belief and Life System|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhabelieflife.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Akha beliefs are passed down through generations by oral recantation. The Akha believe that the being who created earth and life gave Akha the \"Akha Zang\" (Akha Way), their guidelines for life. Akhas believe that spirits and people were born of the same mother and lived together until a quarrel led to their separation, upon which spirits went into the forest and people remained in the villages. Since then, Akha believe that the spirits have caused illness and other unwelcome disruptions of human life. The Akha year is divided into the peoples' season (dry) and the spirits' season (wet). During the latter, spirits wander into the village, so they must be driven out as part of a yearly ancestor offering. Both people and rice are considered to have souls, the flight of which causes disease.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Belief />\n\nThe most important and revered position in Akha spiritual matters is given to a village leader, whose ritual responsibilities include initiating the annual rebuilding of the village gates and the swing as well as advising and instructing villages on important matters and settling disputes. Akha villages have an expert in ironworks called the ''pa jee'' who is considered of great significance in the village and who holds the second most important position within the society.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Iron Equipment Beating |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/the-lron-equipmente-beating.php|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important festival of the year is commonly known as the Swing Festival. The four-day Akha Swing Festival comes in late-August each year and falls on the 120th day after the village has planted its rice. The Akha call the Swing Festival, ''Yehkuja'', which translates as \"eating bitter rice\", a phrase which references the previous year's dwindling rice supply incorporates the hope that monsoons will soon water the new crop. Festival activities include ritual offerings to family ancestral spirits at the ancestral altar in a corner of the women's side of the house. Offerings consist of bits of cooked food, water, and rice whiskey. The swing festival is particularly important for Akha women, who will display the clothing they spent all year making and who will show, through ornamentation, that they are becoming older and of marriageable age. Because the women dress up in their best traditional clothing and ornaments and perform traditional dances and songs for the villagers, the Swing Festival is also known as Women's New Year. The traditional New Year which falls in late-December is known as Men's New Year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Jim |url=http://www.chiangmainews.com/ecmn/viewfa.php?id=497|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Chaing Mai City Life |title=The Akha Swing Festival|date=Sep 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sing Ceremony |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/akha-swing.php|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha put a heavy emphasis on genealogy. An important tradition involves the recounting by Akha males of their patrilineal genealogy. During the most important ceremonies the list is recited in its entirety back over 50 generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. It is said that all Akha males should be able to do so. The recounting of this lineage plays a role in the incest taboo: If a male and female Akha find a common male ancestor within their last six generations, they are not allowed to marry.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Goodman />\n\nThe Akha have several sets of rules governing matters on life, death, marriage, and birth. Akha traditionally marry in their teens or early twenties. Polygamy is permitted. Marriages may be village endogamous or exogamous. Wife-giving and -taking relationships are central to Akha society, with wife-givers superior to wife-takers.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nTwins are considered an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits are considered to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth to more than one offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or so ago, they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it. Akha men whose wives had given birth to twins would not be allowed to participate on the hunt for a specific period.<ref name=Tooker /><ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha and the Spirits|url=http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|accessdate=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610014852/http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|archive-date=10 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCertain types of death, like that caused by a tiger, are considered particularly bad; the bodies must be treated and buried in specific ways.\n\nMissionaries have been active among Akha, especially since the mid-20th century. Some Akha Christians live in separate Christian villages supported by missionary funds. Although many Akha people may be considered converts by the missionaries, nearly 100% practice some mixture of Christianity and traditional Akha beliefs.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite web|title=Joshua Project|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=10223&rog3=CH|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Dress ===\n[[File:MuangSing ThatXiengTung4 tango7174.jpg|thumb|That Xieng Tung Festival, Muang Sing, Laos. Akha young girls in the welcoming committee. On their arrival, visitors will have a color ribbon pinned to their blouse in exchange for a donation.]]\n\nThe Akha people are often noted for their very recognizable sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women are known for their embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.\n\nThe headdresses worn by the women are perhaps the most spectacular and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child's cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the ''jejaw'', the beaded sash that hangs down the front of her skirt and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman's headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique. Silver coins, monkey fur, and dyed chicken feathers are just a few of the things that might decorate the headdress. The headdresses differ by subgroup. According to an article about the variations in Akha headdress, \"High Fashion, Hill Style\", the\n\n<blockquote>\"Ulo Akha headdress consists of a bamboo cone, covered in beads, silver studs and seeds, edged in coins (silver rupees for the rich, baht for the poor) topped by several dangling chicken feather tassels and maybe a woolen pom-pom. The Pamee Akha wear a trapezoidal colt cap covered in silver studs with coins on the beaded side flaps and long chains of linked silver rings hanging down each side. The Lomi Akha wear a round cap covered in silver studs and framed by silver balls, coins and pendants and the married women attach a trapezoidal inscribed plate at the back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tudtu.tripod.com/hillsty1.htm|title=High Fashion, Hill Style|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n<gallery>\nFile:Akha woman, Myanmar.jpg|In Myanmar\nFile:Akha Laos 4-11-06.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha laos 11 03a.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Laos 11 03b.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Dress.JPG|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Woman.jpg|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Man in Thailand.jpg|An Akha man from Ban Mae Chan Tai, [[Chiang Rai Province]], Thailand\n</gallery>\n\n===Akha cuisine===\nThe main staple of Akha cuisine is highland rice.

In the last century, [[cotton]] and [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] were the principal cash crops. More recent cash crops are chilies, soybeans, cabbages, and tomatoes. One or more families in a village may operate a small shop in their home selling items such as items as cigarettes and kerosene. Itinerant traders, either lowlanders or hill-dwelling Yunnan Chinese, come to buy livestock or cash crops, or to sell blankets and other goods.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nIncreasingly, the Akha find themselves, whether solicited or not, in the business of tourism, specifically [[ecotourism]]. Tourists pay a fee to Akha villages to be allowed to witness and participate in \"everyday\" Akha life, although much of what they see is often staged. The villagers dress up in their elaborate costumes and charge tourists to take photos with them. In addition to opening the village for visiting tourists, the Akha also sell their handicrafts, including hand woven baskets and even replicas of their traditional costumes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha Experience|url=http://greendiscoverylaos.com/nt-t-08.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rights, issues, and activism==\n[[File:Ahchooh Erica-Irene Daes.jpg|thumb|A representative of the Akha together with [[Erica-Irene Daes]], a driving force at the [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]], at the [[United Nations]] in New York, 2006]]\n[[File:Elderly Akha couple robbed by Thai army.jpg|thumb|Elderly Akha couple that was robbed by the [[Royal Thai Army|Thai army]]]]\n[[File:Electric.jpg|thumb|Arm wounds from having been subjected to [[electrocution]]]]\nBeing an ethnic minority with little easily accessible legal recourse, Akha everywhere have long been subject to rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nPerhaps the most important issue facing the Akha pertains to their land. The Akha relationship to land is vitally connected to the continuation of the Akha culture, but they rarely have \"official\" or state-sanctioned land rights or claims to their land as land rights are considered traditional. These conceptions of land are at odds with those held by the nation states whose land the Akha now occupy. Most Akha are not full-fledged citizens of the country they inhabit and are thus not allowed to legally purchase land, although most Akha villagers are too poor to even consider purchasing land.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIt has been reported{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} by rights groups that several land seizures of Akha land have been undertaken in the name of the Queen of Thailand. Originally a semi-nomadic people, the Akha are often relocated by the presiding national government to permanent villages, after which the government allegedly sells to logging companies and other private corporations access to lands formerly occupied by the Akha. The land onto which the Akha are displaced is almost always less fertile than their previous plots. On their new lands, the Akha can rarely produce enough food to sustain themselves and are often forced to leave and seek employment outside the villages, thus disrupting their traditional culture and economy.\n\nIn Thailand, laws have been passed that curb people's rights to the forest, including the 2007 Community Forest Act. According to the network of indigenous peoples in Thailand,\n<blockquote>\"These laws and resolutions have had severe impacts on indigenous peoples' rights to residence and land. Under these laws and resolutions millions of hectares of land have been declared as reserved and conservation forests, or protected areas. Today, 28.78% of Thailand is categorized as protected areas. As a result, thousands of farmers previously living in the forest or relying on the forest for their livelihood have been arrested and imprisoned and their lands seized. Cases have been filed against them for the so-called encroachment on government land.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section2/2010/12/indigenous-peoples-of-thailand.html|title=Indigenous Peoples of Thailand|publisher=Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite having signed and ratified the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the Thai government has not changed laws to adhere to those recommendations emphasizing respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and their full and effective participation in protected areas management and policy-making.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest Peoples|url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in Thailand; A Review |url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons given for Akha relocations vary, but a common response on the part of the Thai government is to cite a concern for the preservation of forests and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural techniques than the slash and burn agriculture traditionally used by the Akha. The Thai government's involvement in relocation might also possibly be motivated by concerns of national security. According to international human rights lawyer Jonathan Levy,\n<blockquote>\"The Akha are identified with the opium growers who until recently dominated that portion of the \"Golden Triangle\" in Thailand. Thailand has taken steps to eradicate opium cultivation by resettling the Akha into permanent villages. However, both opium and long ingrained farming techniques are key to the complex Akha culture. While traditional opium cultivation has been suppressed, processed heroine and latest scourge, methamphetamine, is freely available from Burma. Thus Akha have become both impoverished farmers and in many cases narcotic addicts. As the Akha are resettled they come into contact with mainstream Thai culture, many Akha women are drawn to the \"easy\" money of the sex industry.\"<ref name=Levy /></blockquote>\n\nThe Akha are said to have the highest rates of addiction of all the hill tribes and are at the highest risk for contracting [[HIV]], [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], or an STD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/files/25230/11434696181167_EX_Prevention_of_HIV-AIDS_among_Ethnic_Minorities_Mekong.pdf/167%2BEX%2BPrevention%2Bof%2BHIV-AIDS%2Bamong%2BEthnic%2BMinorities%2BMekong.pdf |title=Prevention of HIV/AIDS among Ethnic Minorities of the Upper Mekong Region through Community-based Non-Formal and Formal Education|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Measures have been undertaken by state and human rights organizations including the UNESCO Asia Pacific Regional Bureau for Education in Bangkok, and NCA in Lao PDR, to provide hill tribes, including the Akha, with \"comprehensive community-based, non-formal education\" on HIV and drug abuse prevention. In addition, detoxification clinics have been opened in the region, with particularly positive consequences for women who tend to have lower rates of addiction, but often bear the brunt of compensating for their missing partners financially and emotionally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coehn|first=Paul|title=Opium-Reduction Programmes, Discourses of Addiction and Gender in Northwest Laos|journal=Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia|date=April 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201323 |jstor=41057073}}</ref>\n\nDespite their numbers, the Akha are the poorest of all the hill tribes. As roads bring accessibility and tourists, they provide relief from the poverty of village life, especially for the younger generations who increasingly find themselves engaged in labor outside the villages. Many villages report a population decrease as many leave to find work in the cities, often for very long periods. Many Akha complain that the younger generations are becoming increasingly less interested in traditional culture and ways and more and more susceptible to outside, mainstream, cultural influences. According to one author, where the village squares were once \"filled with the sounds of courtship songs\", radios are now more likely to play pop hits.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nAs it becomes increasingly difficult to remain self-sufficient through agriculture, and as roads open up the villages to the cities, the Akha must contend with the sometimes corrosive effects of the tourist industry. Not all Akha are happy to let tourists come in and observe village life. The Akha are often the objects of [[ecotourism]] which purports to open up remote spaces and people to Western tourists to expand their knowledge of the plight of the people and their perilous situation, and thus, expand their involvement in the fight to maintain their environment and way of life. It is pitched as \"responsible tourism\". There are many critiques{{by whom|date=September 2013}} of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity{{clarify|What is a \"contradictory activity\" and why is it wrong?|date=September 2013}} including detrimental effects on the environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.\n\nWhile ecotourism agencies claim to help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha feel{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} that they are being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people{{Who|date=September 2015}} do not see the tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive [[commercialization]] and [[commodification]] of their culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nMany Akha{{Who|date=September 2015}} complain of the missionaries that come to the villages to convert them, sometimes forcibly, to Christianity. Many Akha feel that the missionaries generalize about, or in this particular case, \"paganize\" the Akha traditional belief system, demeaning their longstanding beliefs. Some of the claims made against missionaries include the kidnapping of Akha children into orphanages and forced labor, the sterilization of Akha women and the forced or underpaid labor of Akha on farms. Many rights groups make the claim that the money spent by missionaries on building churches and furthering Christian education could be better spent on helping the Akha with medical and sanitation improvements that are greatly needed in most villages.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite AV media |title=Prisoners of A White God |people=Lichtag, Steve (director) |publisher=Twin Star |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Akha language]]\n* [[Matthew McDaniel]]\n* [[Prisoners of a White God]]\n* [[Clement Vismara]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=James C |authorlink=James C.

They made their way from China into Southeast Asia during the early 20th century. Civil war in Burma and Laos resulted in an increased flow of Akha immigrants and there are now 80,000 people living in Thailand's [[Northern Thailand|northern provinces]] of [[Chiang Rai]] and [[Chiang Mai]].<ref>Chiang Mai's Hill Peoples in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''Ancient Chiang Mai'' Volume 3. Chiang Mai, Cognoscenti Books, 2012.</ref> Many of their villages can be visited by tourists on trekking tours from either of these cities.\n\nThe Akha speak [[Akha language|Akha]], a language in the [[Loloish languages|Loloish (Yi) branch]] of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family. The Akha language is closely related to [[Lisu language|Lisu]] and it is thought that the Akha who once ruled the [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] and [[Tengchong]] plains in Yunnan before the invasion of the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1644.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[Image:Flag of the Akha People (Thailand).svg|thumb|Flag of the Akha People in Thailand]]\nScholars agree with the Akha that they originated in China; they disagree, however, about whether the original homeland was the Tibetan borderlands, as the Akha claim, or farther south and east in Yunnan Province, the northernmost residence of present-day Akha. The historically documented existence of relations with the Shan prince of Kengtung indicates that Akha were in eastern Burma as early as the 1860s. They first entered Thailand from Burma at the turn of the 20th-century, many having fled the decades-long civil war in Burma.<ref name=Kammerer>{{cite journal|last=Kammerer|first=Cornelia Ann|journal=Gle Rubin Virtual Reference Library|year=1996|volume=5|series=East and South East Asia|pages=11\u201313|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=cuny_hunter&tabID=T003&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=3&contentSet=GALE%7CCX3458000748&&docId=GALE%7CCX3458000748&docType=GALE|accessdate=30 April 2012|title=GALE search|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref name=Levy>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Jonathan|title=The Akha and Modernization; A Quasi Legal Perspective|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhamodernization.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Population distribution and indigenous status ==\n[[File:Akha laos 11 03d.jpg|thumb|An Akha girl in Laos]]\nAkha live in villages in the mountains of southwest China, eastern [[Myanmar]], western [[Laos]], northwestern [[Vietnam]], and [[northern Thailand]]. In all these countries they are an ethnic minority. The population of the Akha today is roughly 400,000. A decline in village size in Thailand since the 1930s has been noted and attributed to the deteriorating ecological and economic situation in the mountains.<ref name=Thailine>{{cite web|url=http://www.thailine.com/thailand/english/hill-e/akha-e.htm|title=Akha|work=The Hilltribes of Thailand|publisher=Thailand Online|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha are often classified by the Chinese government as part of the [[Hani people|Hani]], an official national minority. The Akha are closely related to the Hani, but consider themselves a distinct group and often resist being subsumed under that identity.<ref name=Hilltribe>{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> In Thailand, they are classified as one of the six [[hill tribes]], a term used for all of the various tribal peoples who migrated from China and Tibet over the past few centuries and who now inhabit the dense forests on the borders between Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.<ref name=Levy />\n\nThe Akha are not always treated or addressed as equals by the people whose countries they now inhabit. Speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Myanmar and Thailand refer to them as \"gaw\" or \"ekaw\" (ikaw/ikho), terms which the Akha view as derogatory. In Laos the colloquial term used by Tai speakers to refer to the Akha is \"kho\" (ko), often prefaced by the word \"kha\", which means \"slave.\"<ref name=Kammerer />\n\n== Language ==\n[[File:Akha women.jpg|thumb|Akha women c. 1900.]]\nCalled \"Avkavdawv,\" meaning \"[[Akha language]],\" by its native speakers, Akha is a tonal language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. The vast majority of Akha speakers can understand the ''jeu g\u2019oe'' (\"jer way\") dialect spoken in southern China, Thailand, and Myanmar.<ref name=Kammerer /> Some basic and systematic variations in regional dialects of Akha are discussed by Paul Lewis in his ''Akha-English-Thai Dictionary''. Very few dialects of Akha do not share mutual intelligibility. The Akha have no written language, but there are several competing scripts that have been written by missionaries and other foreigners.<ref name=Hilltribe />\n\n== Akha villages and culture ==\n[[File:Maejantai Chiang Rai province 01.JPG|thumb|300px|The village of Mae Chan Tai in [[Mae Suai District]], Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, is a more modern village. Note the large coffee drying platforms.]]\nDue to rapid social and economic changes in the regions the Akha inhabit, particularly the introduction of Western modes of capitalism, attempts to continue many of the traditional aspects of Akha life are increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges, Akha people practice many elements of their traditional culture with much success.\n\nAkha society lacks a strict system of social class and is considered [[egalitarian]]. Respect is typically accorded with age and experience. Ties of patrilineal kinship and marriage alliance bind the Akha within and between communities.<ref name=Kammerer /> Village structures may vary widely from the strictly traditional to Westernized, depending on their proximity to modern towns. Like many of the hill tribes, the Akha build their villages at higher elevations in the mountains.<ref name=Akha>{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Akha |url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhaoverview.html|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAkha dwellings are traditionally constructed of logs, bamboo, and thatch and are of two types: \"low houses\", built on the ground, and \"high houses\", built on stilts. The semi-nomadic Akha, at least those who have not been moved to permanent village sites, typically do not build their houses as permanent residences and will often move their villages. Some say that this gives the dwellings a deceptively fragile and flimsy appearance, although they are quite well-built as proved over generations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indigenous Peoples of the World - The Akha|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Akha |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nEntrances to all Akha villages are fitted with a wooden gate adorned with elaborate carvings on both sides depicting imagery of men and women. It is known as a \"spirit gate\". It marks the division between the inside of the village, the domain of man and domesticated animals, and the outside, the realm of spirits and wildlife. The gates function to ward off evil spirits and to entice favorable ones. Carvings can be seen on the roofs of the villager's houses as a second measure to control the flow of spirits.\n\nHouses are segregated by gender, with specific areas for men as well as a common space. This divide is said to mimic the function of the gate.<ref name=Hilltribe /> Another important feature found in most Akha villages is a tall four-posted village swing which is used in an annual ancestor offering related to the fertility of rice. The swing is built annually by an elder called a ''dzoeuh mah''.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe />\n<gallery>\nFile:Gate leading to the akha hilltribe village.jpg|An Akha \"Spirit Gate\" in Thailand\nFile:Akha Hut.JPG|Akha hut\nFile:Akha fishing.JPG|Akha fishing\nFile:Akha hilltribe, Chiang Rai Province P1110690.JPG| Akha, Chiang Rai Province\nFile:Akha village.jpg|An Akha village, with traditional thatched roofs, in northern [[Thailand]]\nFile:Akha Funeral1.JPG|Akha funeral ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n=== Traditional economy ===\n[[Image:Akha man with opium pipe.jpg|thumb|300 px|Akha man with [[opium pipe]] (1979)]]\nThe traditional form of subsistence for the Akha people has been, and remains, agriculture. The Akha grow a variety of crops including soybeans and vegetables. Rice is the most significant crop and is prominent in much of Akha culture and ritual. Most Akha plant dry-land rice, which depends solely on rainfall for moisture, but in some villages irrigation has been built to water [[paddy field]]s. Historically, some Akha villages cultivated [[opium]], but production diminished after the Thai government banned its cultivation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=Jim|title=Meet the Akha|year=1996|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|location=Bangkok|isbn=9748496562|pages=113}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha have traditionally employed [[slash and burn]] agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, there is usually no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture has contributed to the Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.<ref name=Akha />\n\nIn addition to their agricultural work, the Akha raise livestock including pigs, chickens, ducks, goats, cattle, and water buffalo to supplement their diets and to use for their secondary products. Children usually herd the animals. Akha women gather plants from the surrounding forests as well as eggs and insects the Akha will occasionally eat or use for medicinal purposes. The women and the men will often fish in the local lakes and streams. Some villages construct bee gums with the hope that a colony will nest there and their honey subsequently harvested.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe /><ref name=Goodman>{{cite book |last=Goodman|first=Jim|title=Meet the Akha|year=1996|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|location=Bangkok |isbn=9748496562|pages=113\u2013115}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha are skilled hunters. Hunting is a male activity and a very popular one. It is a favorite pastime and a means of obtaining food. The barking deer is, perhaps, their favorite prey. Guns obtained from trading in the larger towns have begun to replace the use of crossbows in hunting.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Goodman />\n\n===Belief system===\n{{see also|Christianity in Ahka Villages}}\n[[File:Woman with child in Thailand..jpg|thumb|Akha woman with child (Thailand)]]\n[[File:Akha couple.JPG|thumb|Husband carrying the stem of a banana plant, to be fed to pigs]]\nAkha religion\u2014''zahv''\u2014is often described as a mixture of [[animism]] and ancestor worship that emphasizes the Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It might be said that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.<ref name=Tooker>{{cite journal|last=Tooker|first=Deborah|title=Identity Systems of Highland Burma: 'Belief', Akha Zan, and a Critique of Interiorized Notions of Ethno-Religious Identity|journal=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=27|pages=799\u2013819|jstor=2804175}}</ref>\n\nThe annual ritual cycle consists of nine or twelve ancestor offerings, rice rituals, and other rites such as the building of the village gates. Many Akha rituals and festivals serve to seek \"blessings\" (''guivlahav'') from ancestors, which are according to the ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures'', \"...fertility and health in people, rice, and domesticated animals.\"<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Belief>{{cite web|title=The Akha Belief and Life System|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhabelieflife.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Akha beliefs are passed down through generations by oral recantation. The Akha believe that the being who created earth and life gave Akha the \"Akha Zang\" (Akha Way), their guidelines for life. Akhas believe that spirits and people were born of the same mother and lived together until a quarrel led to their separation, upon which spirits went into the forest and people remained in the villages. Since then, Akha believe that the spirits have caused illness and other unwelcome disruptions of human life. The Akha year is divided into the peoples' season (dry) and the spirits' season (wet). During the latter, spirits wander into the village, so they must be driven out as part of a yearly ancestor offering. Both people and rice are considered to have souls, the flight of which causes disease.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Belief />\n\nThe most important and revered position in Akha spiritual matters is given to a village leader, whose ritual responsibilities include initiating the annual rebuilding of the village gates and the swing as well as advising and instructing villages on important matters and settling disputes. Akha villages have an expert in ironworks called the ''pa jee'' who is considered of great significance in the village and who holds the second most important position within the society.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Iron Equipment Beating |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/the-lron-equipmente-beating.php|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important festival of the year is commonly known as the Swing Festival. The four-day Akha Swing Festival comes in late-August each year and falls on the 120th day after the village has planted its rice. The Akha call the Swing Festival, ''Yehkuja'', which translates as \"eating bitter rice\", a phrase which references the previous year's dwindling rice supply incorporates the hope that monsoons will soon water the new crop. Festival activities include ritual offerings to family ancestral spirits at the ancestral altar in a corner of the women's side of the house. Offerings consist of bits of cooked food, water, and rice whiskey. The swing festival is particularly important for Akha women, who will display the clothing they spent all year making and who will show, through ornamentation, that they are becoming older and of marriageable age. Because the women dress up in their best traditional clothing and ornaments and perform traditional dances and songs for the villagers, the Swing Festival is also known as Women's New Year. The traditional New Year which falls in late-December is known as Men's New Year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Jim |url=http://www.chiangmainews.com/ecmn/viewfa.php?id=497|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Chaing Mai City Life |title=The Akha Swing Festival|date=Sep 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sing Ceremony |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/akha-swing.php|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha put a heavy emphasis on genealogy. An important tradition involves the recounting by Akha males of their patrilineal genealogy. During the most important ceremonies the list is recited in its entirety back over 50 generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. It is said that all Akha males should be able to do so. The recounting of this lineage plays a role in the incest taboo: If a male and female Akha find a common male ancestor within their last six generations, they are not allowed to marry.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Goodman />\n\nThe Akha have several sets of rules governing matters on life, death, marriage, and birth. Akha traditionally marry in their teens or early twenties. Polygamy is permitted. Marriages may be village endogamous or exogamous. Wife-giving and -taking relationships are central to Akha society, with wife-givers superior to wife-takers.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nTwins are considered an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits are considered to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth to more than one offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or so ago, they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it. Akha men whose wives had given birth to twins would not be allowed to participate on the hunt for a specific period.<ref name=Tooker /><ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha and the Spirits|url=http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|accessdate=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610014852/http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|archive-date=10 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCertain types of death, like that caused by a tiger, are considered particularly bad; the bodies must be treated and buried in specific ways.\n\nMissionaries have been active among Akha, especially since the mid-20th century. Some Akha Christians live in separate Christian villages supported by missionary funds. Although many Akha people may be considered converts by the missionaries, nearly 100% practice some mixture of Christianity and traditional Akha beliefs.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite web|title=Joshua Project|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=10223&rog3=CH|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Dress ===\n[[File:MuangSing ThatXiengTung4 tango7174.jpg|thumb|That Xieng Tung Festival, Muang Sing, Laos. Akha young girls in the welcoming committee. On their arrival, visitors will have a color ribbon pinned to their blouse in exchange for a donation.]]\n\nThe Akha people are often noted for their very recognizable sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women are known for their embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.\n\nThe headdresses worn by the women are perhaps the most spectacular and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child's cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the ''jejaw'', the beaded sash that hangs down the front of her skirt and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman's headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique. Silver coins, monkey fur, and dyed chicken feathers are just a few of the things that might decorate the headdress. The headdresses differ by subgroup. According to an article about the variations in Akha headdress, \"High Fashion, Hill Style\", the\n\n<blockquote>\"Ulo Akha headdress consists of a bamboo cone, covered in beads, silver studs and seeds, edged in coins (silver rupees for the rich, baht for the poor) topped by several dangling chicken feather tassels and maybe a woolen pom-pom. The Pamee Akha wear a trapezoidal colt cap covered in silver studs with coins on the beaded side flaps and long chains of linked silver rings hanging down each side. The Lomi Akha wear a round cap covered in silver studs and framed by silver balls, coins and pendants and the married women attach a trapezoidal inscribed plate at the back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tudtu.tripod.com/hillsty1.htm|title=High Fashion, Hill Style|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n<gallery>\nFile:Akha woman, Myanmar.jpg|In Myanmar\nFile:Akha Laos 4-11-06.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha laos 11 03a.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Laos 11 03b.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Dress.JPG|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Woman.jpg|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Man in Thailand.jpg|An Akha man from Ban Mae Chan Tai, [[Chiang Rai Province]], Thailand\n</gallery>\n\n===Akha cuisine===\nThe main staple of Akha cuisine is highland rice.

In the last century, [[cotton]] and [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] were the principal cash crops. More recent cash crops are chilies, soybeans, cabbages, and tomatoes. One or more families in a village may operate a small shop in their home selling items such as items as cigarettes and kerosene. Itinerant traders, either lowlanders or hill-dwelling Yunnan Chinese, come to buy livestock or cash crops, or to sell blankets and other goods.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nIncreasingly, the Akha find themselves, whether solicited or not, in the business of tourism, specifically [[ecotourism]]. Tourists pay a fee to Akha villages to be allowed to witness and participate in \"everyday\" Akha life, although much of what they see is often staged. The villagers dress up in their elaborate costumes and charge tourists to take photos with them. In addition to opening the village for visiting tourists, the Akha also sell their handicrafts, including hand woven baskets and even replicas of their traditional costumes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha Experience|url=http://greendiscoverylaos.com/nt-t-08.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rights, issues, and activism==\n[[File:Ahchooh Erica-Irene Daes.jpg|thumb|A representative of the Akha together with [[Erica-Irene Daes]], a driving force at the [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]], at the [[United Nations]] in New York, 2006]]\n[[File:Elderly Akha couple robbed by Thai army.jpg|thumb|Elderly Akha couple that was robbed by the [[Royal Thai Army|Thai army]]]]\n[[File:Electric.jpg|thumb|Arm wounds from having been subjected to [[electrocution]]]]\nBeing an ethnic minority with little easily accessible legal recourse, Akha everywhere have long been subject to rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nPerhaps the most important issue facing the Akha pertains to their land. The Akha relationship to land is vitally connected to the continuation of the Akha culture, but they rarely have \"official\" or state-sanctioned land rights or claims to their land as land rights are considered traditional. These conceptions of land are at odds with those held by the nation states whose land the Akha now occupy. Most Akha are not full-fledged citizens of the country they inhabit and are thus not allowed to legally purchase land, although most Akha villagers are too poor to even consider purchasing land.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIt has been reported{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} by rights groups that several land seizures of Akha land have been undertaken in the name of the Queen of Thailand. Originally a semi-nomadic people, the Akha are often relocated by the presiding national government to permanent villages, after which the government allegedly sells to logging companies and other private corporations access to lands formerly occupied by the Akha. The land onto which the Akha are displaced is almost always less fertile than their previous plots. On their new lands, the Akha can rarely produce enough food to sustain themselves and are often forced to leave and seek employment outside the villages, thus disrupting their traditional culture and economy.\n\nIn Thailand, laws have been passed that curb people's rights to the forest, including the 2007 Community Forest Act. According to the network of indigenous peoples in Thailand,\n<blockquote>\"These laws and resolutions have had severe impacts on indigenous peoples' rights to residence and land. Under these laws and resolutions millions of hectares of land have been declared as reserved and conservation forests, or protected areas. Today, 28.78% of Thailand is categorized as protected areas. As a result, thousands of farmers previously living in the forest or relying on the forest for their livelihood have been arrested and imprisoned and their lands seized. Cases have been filed against them for the so-called encroachment on government land.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section2/2010/12/indigenous-peoples-of-thailand.html|title=Indigenous Peoples of Thailand|publisher=Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite having signed and ratified the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the Thai government has not changed laws to adhere to those recommendations emphasizing respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and their full and effective participation in protected areas management and policy-making.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest Peoples|url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in Thailand; A Review |url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons given for Akha relocations vary, but a common response on the part of the Thai government is to cite a concern for the preservation of forests and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural techniques than the slash and burn agriculture traditionally used by the Akha. The Thai government's involvement in relocation might also possibly be motivated by concerns of national security. According to international human rights lawyer Jonathan Levy,\n<blockquote>\"The Akha are identified with the opium growers who until recently dominated that portion of the \"Golden Triangle\" in Thailand. Thailand has taken steps to eradicate opium cultivation by resettling the Akha into permanent villages. However, both opium and long ingrained farming techniques are key to the complex Akha culture. While traditional opium cultivation has been suppressed, processed heroine and latest scourge, methamphetamine, is freely available from Burma. Thus Akha have become both impoverished farmers and in many cases narcotic addicts. As the Akha are resettled they come into contact with mainstream Thai culture, many Akha women are drawn to the \"easy\" money of the sex industry.\"<ref name=Levy /></blockquote>\n\nThe Akha are said to have the highest rates of addiction of all the hill tribes and are at the highest risk for contracting [[HIV]], [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], or an STD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/files/25230/11434696181167_EX_Prevention_of_HIV-AIDS_among_Ethnic_Minorities_Mekong.pdf/167%2BEX%2BPrevention%2Bof%2BHIV-AIDS%2Bamong%2BEthnic%2BMinorities%2BMekong.pdf |title=Prevention of HIV/AIDS among Ethnic Minorities of the Upper Mekong Region through Community-based Non-Formal and Formal Education|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Measures have been undertaken by state and human rights organizations including the UNESCO Asia Pacific Regional Bureau for Education in Bangkok, and NCA in Lao PDR, to provide hill tribes, including the Akha, with \"comprehensive community-based, non-formal education\" on HIV and drug abuse prevention. In addition, detoxification clinics have been opened in the region, with particularly positive consequences for women who tend to have lower rates of addiction, but often bear the brunt of compensating for their missing partners financially and emotionally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coehn|first=Paul|title=Opium-Reduction Programmes, Discourses of Addiction and Gender in Northwest Laos|journal=Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia|date=April 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201323 |jstor=41057073}}</ref>\n\nDespite their numbers, the Akha are the poorest of all the hill tribes. As roads bring accessibility and tourists, they provide relief from the poverty of village life, especially for the younger generations who increasingly find themselves engaged in labor outside the villages. Many villages report a population decrease as many leave to find work in the cities, often for very long periods. Many Akha complain that the younger generations are becoming increasingly less interested in traditional culture and ways and more and more susceptible to outside, mainstream, cultural influences. According to one author, where the village squares were once \"filled with the sounds of courtship songs\", radios are now more likely to play pop hits.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nAs it becomes increasingly difficult to remain self-sufficient through agriculture, and as roads open up the villages to the cities, the Akha must contend with the sometimes corrosive effects of the tourist industry. Not all Akha are happy to let tourists come in and observe village life. The Akha are often the objects of [[ecotourism]] which purports to open up remote spaces and people to Western tourists to expand their knowledge of the plight of the people and their perilous situation, and thus, expand their involvement in the fight to maintain their environment and way of life. It is pitched as \"responsible tourism\". There are many critiques{{by whom|date=September 2013}} of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity{{clarify|What is a \"contradictory activity\" and why is it wrong?|date=September 2013}} including detrimental effects on the environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.\n\nWhile ecotourism agencies claim to help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha feel{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} that they are being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people{{Who|date=September 2015}} do not see the tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive [[commercialization]] and [[commodification]] of their culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nMany Akha{{Who|date=September 2015}} complain of the missionaries that come to the villages to convert them, sometimes forcibly, to Christianity. Many Akha feel that the missionaries generalize about, or in this particular case, \"paganize\" the Akha traditional belief system, demeaning their longstanding beliefs. Some of the claims made against missionaries include the kidnapping of Akha children into orphanages and forced labor, the sterilization of Akha women and the forced or underpaid labor of Akha on farms. Many rights groups make the claim that the money spent by missionaries on building churches and furthering Christian education could be better spent on helping the Akha with medical and sanitation improvements that are greatly needed in most villages.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite AV media |title=Prisoners of A White God |people=Lichtag, Steve (director) |publisher=Twin Star |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Akha language]]\n* [[Matthew McDaniel]]\n* [[Prisoners of a White God]]\n* [[Clement Vismara]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=James C |authorlink=James C.
