First recorded by [[the Everly Brothers]] in July 1960, the song is also well known from a 1975 international hit version by the Scottish [[hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] a top five hit in 1975 by the English singer [[Jim Capaldi]].\n\n==Appearances==\nThe song was introduced in December 1960 as an album track on ''[[A Date with The Everly Brothers]]'', but was never released as a single (A-side or B-side) by the Everlys. The first hit version of the song was by [[Roy Orbison]], who earned Australian radio play, hitting the Top Five of that country's singles charts in 1961. A recording by [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Gram Parsons]] was included on Parsons' posthumously released ''[[Grievous Angel]]'' album. After Parsons' 1973 death, Harris made the song a staple of her repertoire, and has included it in her concert set lists from the 1970s to the present. Harris has since re-recorded the song twice. [[Jennifer Warnes]] released a version on her self-titled album in 1976.\n\nThe most successful recording of the song was by [[hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], who took the song to the U.S. Top 10 in 1975 and hit number one in Norway and the Netherlands.\nIn the UK the most successful version of the song was by former [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member Jim Capaldi, who took it to number four in the charts in November 1975 during an 11-week run.\nThe song was also covered by [[Cher]] in 1975 for her album ''Stars''. Cher re-recorded the song in 1991 for her album of the same name.\n[[Joan Jett]] included a version of the song on her 1990 album, [[The Hit List (Joan Jett album)|The Hit List]], a covers compilation.\n[[Rod Stewart]] recorded the song in 2006 for his album ''[[Still the Same...

First recorded by [[the Everly Brothers]] in July 1960, the song is also well known from a 1975 international hit version by the Scottish [[hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] a top five hit in 1975 by the English singer [[Jim Capaldi]].\n\n==Appearances==\nThe song was introduced in December 1960 as an album track on ''[[A Date with The Everly Brothers]]'', but was never released as a single (A-side or B-side) by the Everlys. The first hit version of the song was by [[Roy Orbison]], who earned Australian radio play, hitting the Top Five of that country's singles charts in 1961. A recording by [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Gram Parsons]] was included on Parsons' posthumously released ''[[Grievous Angel]]'' album. After Parsons' 1973 death, Harris made the song a staple of her repertoire, and has included it in her concert set lists from the 1970s to the present. Harris has since re-recorded the song twice. [[Jennifer Warnes]] released a version on her self-titled album in 1976.\n\nThe most successful recording of the song was by [[hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], who took the song to the U.S. Top 10 in 1975 and hit number one in Norway and the Netherlands.\nIn the UK the most successful version of the song was by former [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member Jim Capaldi, who took it to number four in the charts in November 1975 during an 11-week run.\nThe song was also covered by [[Cher]] in 1975 for her album ''Stars''. Cher re-recorded the song in 1991 for her album of the same name.\n[[Joan Jett]] included a version of the song on her 1990 album, [[The Hit List (Joan Jett album)|The Hit List]], a covers compilation.\n[[Rod Stewart]] recorded the song in 2006 for his album ''[[Still the Same...

It denies an opponent's ability to do the same, while employing [[cyberweapon|technological instruments of war]] to attack an opponent's critical computer systems. Cyberterrorism, on the other hand, is \"the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population\".<ref>Lewis, James. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Assessing the Risks of Cyber Terrorism, Cyber War and Other Cyber Threats. Washington, D.C.: , 2002. Web.</ref> That means the end result of both cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism is the same, to damage critical infrastructures and computer systems linked together within the confines of cyberspace.\n\nThe financial crime expert Veit Buetterlin explained that organizations, including state actors, which cannot finance themselves through trade because of imposed sanctions, conduct cyber attacks on banks to generate funds.<ref>https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/living-markets/videos/fighting-war-against-terrorist-financing</ref>\n\n== Factors ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2014}}\nThree factors contribute to why cyber-attacks are launched against a state or an individual: the fear factor, spectacularity factor, and vulnerability factor.\n\n=== Spectacularity factor ===\nThe spectacularity factor is a measure of the actual damage achieved by an attack, meaning that the attack creates direct losses (usually loss of availability or loss of income) and garners negative publicity. On 8 February 2000, a Denial of Service attack severely reduced traffic to many major sites, including Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, and eBay (the attack continued to affect still other sites the next day).<ref name = \"DOS_ex\">{{cite web|url=https://www.garykessler.net/library/ddos.html|title=Distributed Denial-Of-Service|website=www.garykessler.net}}</ref> Amazon reportedly estimated the loss of business at $600,000.<ref name = \"DOS_ex\" />\n\n=== Vulnerability factor ===\nVulnerability factor exploits how vulnerable an organization or government establishment is to cyber-attacks. Organizations without maintenance systems might be running on old servers which are more vulnerable than updated systems. An organization can be vulnerable to a denial of service attack and a government establishment can be defaced on a web page. A computer network attack disrupts the integrity or authenticity of data, usually through malicious code that alters program logic that controls data, leading to errors in output.<ref name=linden>Linden, Edward. Focus on Terrorism. New York: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], 2007. Web.</ref>\n\n== Professional hackers to cyberterrorists ==\n{{original research|section|date=March 2015}}\nProfessional hackers, either working on their own or employed by government agencies or the military, can find computer systems with vulnerabilities lacking the appropriate security software. Once those vulnerabilities are found, they can infect systems with malicious code and then remotely control the system or computer by sending commands to view content or to disrupt other computers. There needs to be a pre-existing system flaw within the computer such as no antivirus protection or faulty system configuration for the viral code to work.\n\nMany professional hackers will promote themselves to cyberterrorists, where a new set of rules govern their actions. Cyberterrorists have premeditated plans and their attacks are not born of rage.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} They need to develop their plans step-by-step and acquire the appropriate software to carry out an attack. They usually have political agendas, targeting political structures. Cyberterrorists are hackers with a political motivation, their attacks can impact political structure through this corruption and destruction.<ref name=prichard>Prichard, Janet, and Laurie MacDonald. \"Cyber Terrorism: A Study of the Extent of Coverage in Computer Security Textbooks.\" Journal of Information Technology Education. 3. (2004): n. page. Web.</ref>  They also target civilians, civilian interests and civilian installations. As previously stated cyberterrorists attack persons or property and cause enough harm to generate fear.\n\n== Types of attack ==\nAn attack can be ''active'' or ''passive''.<ref name=rfc2828/>\n\n: An \"active attack\" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.\n: A \"[[passive attack]]\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources (e.g., [[telephone tapping|wiretapping]]).\nAn attack can be perpetrated by an ''insider'' or from'' outside'' the organization;<ref name=rfc2828/>\n: An \"inside attack\" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an \"insider\"), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization.\n: An \"outside attack\" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an \"outsider\"). In the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments.\n\nThe term \"attack\" relates to some other basic security terms as shown in the following diagram:<ref name=rfc2828/>\n\n<pre>\n      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+\n      | An Attack:              |  |Counter- |  | A System Resource:   |\n      | i.e., A Threat Action   |  | measure |  | Target of the Attack |\n      | +----------+            |  |         |  | +-----------------+  |\n      | | Attacker |<==================||<=========                 |  |\n      | |   i.e.,  |   Passive  |  |         |  | |  Vulnerability  |  |\n      | | A Threat |<=================>||<========>                 |  |\n      | |  Agent   |  or Active |  |         |  | +-------|||-------+  |\n      | +----------+   Attack   |  |         |  |         VVV          |\n      |                         |  |         |  | Threat Consequences  |\n      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+\n</pre>\n\nA resource (both physical or logical), called an [[asset (computing)|asset]], can have one or more [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] that can be [[Exploit (computer security)|exploited]] by a [[Threat (computer)|threat]] agent in a threat action. As a result, the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] of resources may be compromised. Potentially, the damage may extend to resources in addition to the one initially identified as vulnerable, including further resources of the organization, and the resources of other involved parties (customers, suppliers).\n\nThe so-called [[CIA triad]] is the basis of [[information security]].\n\nThe attack can be ''active'' when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A \"''passive attack''\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises confidentiality.\n\nA threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either \"intentional\" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or \"accidental\" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an \"act of God\" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).<ref name=rfc2828/>\n\nA set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[information security management system]]s (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[risk management]] principles, the [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.<ref name=Vacca>{{cite book\n|last= Wright\n|first=Joe\n|author2=Jim Harmening\n|editor-last=Vacca\n|editor-first=John\n|title=Computer and Information Security Handbook\n|series=Morgan Kaufmann Publications\n|year=2009\n|publisher= Elsevier Inc\n|isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1\n|page=257\n|chapter=15\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAn attack should led to a ''security incident'' i.e. a ''security event'' that involves a ''security violation''.

The first logical step is to set up an [[incident response]] plan and eventually a [[computer emergency response team]].\n\nIn order to detect attacks, a number of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] can be set up at organizational, procedural and technical levels. [[Computer emergency response team]], [[information technology security audit]] and [[intrusion detection system]] are example of these.<ref name=Vacca1>{{cite book\n|last= Caballero\n|first=Albert\n|editor-last=Vacca\n|editor-first=John\n|title=Computer and Information Security Handbook\n|series=Morgan Kaufmann Publications\n|year=2009\n|publisher= Elsevier Inc\n|isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1\n|page=225\n|chapter=14\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAn attack usually is perpetrated by someone with bad intentions: [[Hacker (computer security)|black hatted]] attacks falls in this category, while other perform [[penetration test]]ing on an organization information system to find out if all foreseen controls are in place.\n\nThe attacks can be classified according to their origin: i.e. if it is conducted using one or more computers: in the last case is called a distributed attack. [[Botnet]]s are used to conduct distributed attacks.\n\nOther classifications are according to the procedures used or the type of vulnerabilities exploited: attacks can be concentrated on network mechanisms or host features.\n\nSome attacks are physical: i.e. theft or damage of computers and other equipment. Others are attempts to force changes in the logic used by computers or network protocols in order to achieve unforeseen (by the original designer) result but useful for the attacker.

Attacks are broken down into two categories: syntactic attacks and semantic attacks. '''Syntactic attacks''' are straightforward; it is considered malicious software which includes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.\n\n=== Syntactic attacks ===\n==== Viruses ====\n{{Main|Computer virus}}\nA virus is a self-replicating program that can attach itself to another program or file in order to reproduce. The virus can hide in unlikely locations in the memory of a computer system and attach itself to whatever file it sees fit to execute its code. It can also change its digital footprint each time it replicates making it harder to track down in the computer.\n\n==== Worms ====\n{{Main|Computer worm}}\nA worm does not need another file or program to copy itself; it is a self-sustaining running program. Worms replicate over a network using protocols. The latest incarnation of worms make use of known vulnerabilities in systems to penetrate, execute their code, and replicate to other systems such as the Code Red II worm that infected more than 259 000 systems in less than 14 hours.<ref>Janczewski, Lech, and Andrew Colarik. Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism. Hershey, New York: Information Science Reference, 2008. Web.</ref> On a much larger scale, worms can be designed for industrial espionage to monitor and collect server and traffic activities then transmit it back to its creator.\n\n==== Trojan horses ====\n{{Main|Trojan horse (computing)}}\nA Trojan horse is designed to perform legitimate tasks but it also performs unknown and unwanted activity. It can be the basis of many viruses and worms installing onto the computer as keyboard loggers and backdoor software. In a commercial sense, Trojans can be imbedded in trial versions of software and can gather additional intelligence about the target without the person even knowing it happening. All three of these are likely to attack an individual and establishment through emails, web browsers, chat clients, remote software, and updates.\n\n=== Semantic attacks ===\n'''Semantic attack''' is the modification and dissemination of correct and incorrect information. Information modified could have been done without the use of computers even though new opportunities can be found by using them. To set someone into the wrong direction or to cover your tracks, the dissemination of incorrect information can be utilized.\n\n==== India and Pakistan ====\n{{Main|India\u2013Pakistan relations}}\nThere were two such instances between India and Pakistan that involved cyberspace conflicts, started in 1990s. Earlier cyber attacks came to known as early as in 1999.<ref name=prichard /> Since then, India and Pakistan were engaged in a long-term dispute over Kashmir which moved into [[cyberspace]]. Historical accounts indicated that each country's hackers have been repeatedly involved in attacking each other's computing database system. The number of attacks has grown yearly: 45 in 1999, 133 in 2000, 275 by the end of August 2001.<ref name=prichard /> In 2010, Indian hackers laid a cyber attack at least 36 government database websites going by the name \"Indian Cyber Army\".<ref name=\"Express Tirbune\">{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Indian Army|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/83967/36-government-websites-hacked-by-indian-cyber-army/|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tirbune|date=30 November 2010}}</ref> In 2013, Indian hackers hacked the official website of [[Election Commission of Pakistan|Election Commission]] of Pakistan in an attempt to retrieve sensitive database information.<ref name=\"The News International 2013\" /> In retaliation, Pakistani hackers, calling themselves \"True Cyber Army\" hacked and defaced ~1,059 websites of Indian election bodies.<ref name=\"The News International 2013\">{{cite news|last=Waseem Abbasi|title=Pakistani hackers defaced over 1,000 Indian websites|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-22095-Pakistani-hackers-defaced-over-1000-Indian-websites|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The News International 2013|date=6 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the media, Pakistan's has been working on effective [[cyber security]] system, in a program called the \"Cyber Secure Pakistan\" (CSP).<ref name=\"The News International, April 2013\">{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Secure Pakistan' initiative launched|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-6-172840-Cyber-Secure-Pakistan-initiative-launched|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=The News International, April 2013|date=22 April 2013}}</ref>  The program was launched in April 2013 by Pakistan Information Security Association and the program has expanded to country's universities.\n\n== Cyberattacks by and against countries ==\nWithin cyberwarfare, the individual must recognize the state actors involved in committing these cyber-attacks against one another. The two predominant players that will be discussed is the age-old [[East\u2013West dichotomy|comparison of East versus West]], China's cyber capabilities compared to United States' capabilities. There are many other state and non-state actors involved in cyberwarfare, such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Al Qaeda; since China and the U.S. are leading the foreground in cyberwarfare capabilities, they will be the only two state actors discussed.\n\nBut in Q2 2013, [[Akamai Technologies]] reported that Indonesia toppled China with portion 38 percent of cyber attack, a high increase from 21 percent portion in previous quarter. China set 33 percent and US set at 6.9 percent. 79 percent of attack came from Asia Pacific region. Indonesia dominated the attacking to ports 80 and 443 by about 90 percent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425836,00.asp |title=Indonesia Tops China as Cyber Attack Capital |date=16 October 2013 | work=PC Magazine}}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\n{{Main|Cyberwarfare in China}}\n{{more citations needed|section, except for one footnote, | date= July 2013}}\nChina's [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) has developed a strategy called \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare\" which guides computer network operations and [[cyberwarfare]] tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance.<ref name=\"krekel\" /> ''The Science of Military'' and ''The Science of Campaigns'' both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyber-attacks and states that cyberwarfare must mark the start if a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success.<ref name=krekel>Krekel, Bryan. People's Republic of China. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation . Virginia: Northrop Grumman, 2009. Web.</ref> Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, electronic deception and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all in the hopes of destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's ''Science of Campaigns'' noted that one role for cyberwarfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of \"blindness\", \"deafness\" or \"paralysis\" created by cyber-attacks.<ref name=krekel /> That is one of the main focal points of cyberwarefare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success.\n\nThe PLA conduct regular training exercises in a variety of environments emphasizing the use of cyberwarfare tactics and techniques in countering such tactics if it is employed against them.  Faculty research has been focusing on designs for rootkit usage and detection for their Kylin Operating System which helps to further train these individuals' cyberwarfare techniques. China perceives cyberwarfare as a deterrent to nuclear weapons, possessing the ability for greater precision, leaving fewer casualties, and allowing for long ranged attacks.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2019}}\n{{See also|Office of Personnel Management data breach|Vault 7}}\nIn the West, the [[United States]] provides a different \"tone of voice\" when cyberwarfare is on the tip of everyone's tongue. The United States provides security plans strictly in the response to cyberwarfare, basically going on the defensive when they are being attacked by devious cyber methods. In the U.S., the responsibility of cybersecurity is divided between the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. In recent years, a new department was created to specifically tend to cyber threats, this department is known as Cyber Command. Cyber Command is a military subcommand under US Strategic Command and is responsible for dealing with threats to the military cyber infrastructure. Cyber Command's service elements include Army Forces Cyber Command, the Twenty-fourth Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command.<ref>Lewis, James, and Katrina Timlin. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cybersecurity and Cyberwarfare: Preliminary Assessment of National Doctrine and Organization. Washington, D.C.: , 2011. Web.</ref> It ensures that the President can navigate and control information systems and that he also has military options available when defense of the nation needs to be enacted in cyberspace. Individuals at Cyber Command must pay attention to state and non-state actors who are developing cyberwarfare capabilities in conducting cyber espionage and other cyber-attacks against the nation and its allies. Cyber Command seeks to be a deterrence factor to dissuade potential adversaries from attacking the U.S., while being a multi-faceted department in conducting cyber operations of its own.\n\nThree prominent events took place which may have been catalysts in the creation of the idea of Cyber Command. There was a failure of critical infrastructure reported by the CIA where malicious activities against information technology systems disrupted electrical power capabilities overseas. This resulted in multi-city power outages across multiple regions. The second event was the exploitation of global financial services. In November 2008, an international bank had a compromised payment processor that allowed fraudulent transactions to be made at more than 130 automated teller machines in 49 cities within a 30-minute period.<ref>United States. Review Team of Government Cybersecurity Experts. Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information and Communications Infrastructure. Washington, D.C.: , Web.</ref> The last event was the systemic loss of U.S. economic value when an industry in 2008 estimated $1 trillion in losses of intellectual property to data theft. Even though all these events were internal catastrophes, they were very real in nature, meaning nothing can stop state or non-state actors to do the same thing on an even grander scale. Other initiatives like the Cyber Training Advisory Council were created to improve the quality, efficiency, and sufficiency of training for computer network defense, attack, and exploitation of enemy cyber operations.\n\nOn both ends of the spectrum, East and West nations show a \"sword and shield\" contrast in ideals. The Chinese have a more offensive minded idea for cyberwarfare, trying to get the pre-emptive strike in the early stages of conflict to gain the upper-hand. In the U.S. there are more reactionary measures being taken at creating systems with impenetrable barriers to protect the nation and its civilians from cyber-attacks.\n\nAccording to ''Homeland Preparedness News'', many mid-sized U.S. companies have a difficult time defending their systems against cyber attacks. Around 80 percent of assets vulnerable to a cyber attack are owned by private companies and organizations.

Certain infrastructures as targets have been highlighted as critical infrastructures in times of conflict that can severely cripple a nation. Control systems, energy resources, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and water facilities are seen as critical infrastructure targets during conflict. A new report on the industrial cybersecurity problems, produced by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and the PA Consulting Group, using data from as far back as 1981, reportedly{{weasel inline|date=May 2013}} has found a 10-fold increase in the number of successful cyber-attacks on infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems since 2000.<ref name=linden /> Cyberattacks that have an adverse physical effect are known as cyber-physical attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Loukas|first1=George|date = June 2015|title=Cyber-Physical Attacks A growing invisible threat|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2818550|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Butterworh-Heinemann (Elsevier)|page = 65 |isbn= 9780128012901}}</ref>\n\n=== Control systems ===\nControl systems are responsible for activating and monitoring industrial or mechanical controls. Many devices are integrated with computer platforms to control valves and gates to certain physical infrastructures. Control systems are usually designed as remote telemetry devices that link to other physical devices through internet access or modems. Little security can be offered when dealing with these devices, enabling many hackers or cyberterrorists to seek out systematic vulnerabilities. Paul Blomgren, manager of sales engineering at cybersecurity firm explained how his people drove to a remote substation, saw a wireless network antenna and immediately plugged in their wireless LAN cards. They took out their laptops and connected to the system because it wasn't using passwords. \"Within 10 minutes, they had mapped every piece of equipment in the facility,\" Blomgren said. \"Within 15 minutes, they mapped every piece of equipment in the operational control network. Within 20 minutes, they were talking to the business network and had pulled off several business reports. They never even left the vehicle.\"<ref name=lyons>Lyons, Marty. United States. Homeland Security. Threat Assessment of Cyber Warfare. Washington, D.C.: , 2005. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Energy ===\nEnergy is seen as the second infrastructure that could be attacked. It is broken down into two categories, electricity and natural gas. '''Electricity''' also known as electric grids power cities, regions, and households; it powers machines and other mechanisms used in day-to-day life. Using US as an example, in a conflict cyberterrorists can access data through the Daily Report of System Status that shows power flows throughout the system and can pinpoint the busiest sections of the grid. By shutting those grids down, they can cause mass hysteria, backlog, and confusion; also being able to locate critical areas of operation to further attacks in a more direct method. Cyberterrorists can access instructions on how to connect to the Bonneville Power Administration which helps direct them on how to not fault the system in the process. This is a major advantage that can be utilized when cyber-attacks are being made because foreign attackers with no prior knowledge of the system can attack with the highest accuracy without drawbacks. Cyberattacks on '''natural gas''' installations go much the same way as it would with attacks on electrical grids. Cyberterrorists can shutdown these installations stopping the flow or they can even reroute gas flows to another section that can be occupied by one of their allies. There was a case in Russia with a gas supplier known as Gazprom, they lost control of their central switchboard which routes gas flow, after an inside operator and Trojan horse program bypassed security.<ref name=lyons />\n\n=== Finance ===\nFinancial infrastructures could be hit hard by cyber-attacks as the financial system is linked by computer systems.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\"/> Money is constantly being exchanged in these institutions and if cyberterrorists were to attack and if transactions were rerouted and large amounts of money stolen, financial industries would collapse and civilians would be without jobs and security. Operations would stall from region to region causing nationwide economic degradation. In the U.S. alone, the average daily volume of transactions hit $3 trillion and 99% of it is non-cash flow.<ref name=lyons /> To be able to disrupt that amount of money for one day or for a period of days can cause lasting damage making investors pull out of funding and erode public confidence.\n\nA cyberattack on a financial institution or transactions may be referred to as a '''cyberheist'''. These attacks may start with phishing that targets employees, using [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to coax information from them. They may allow attackers to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into the network and put [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]]s on the [[Accounting information system|accounting systems]]. In time, the cybercriminals are able to obtain password and keys information. An organization's bank accounts can then be accessed via the information they have stolen using the keyloggers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/avoid_windows_malware_bank_on.html |title=Security Fix - Avoid Windows Malware: Bank on a Live CD |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref> In May 2013, a gang carried out a US$40 million cyberheist from the [[Bank of Muscat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinenewsoman.com/2013/05/17/indian-companies-at-center-of-global-cyber-heist/|title=Indian Companies at Center of Global Cyber Heist|website=onlinenewsoman.com|access-date=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231074756/http://onlinenewsoman.com/2013/05/17/indian-companies-at-center-of-global-cyber-heist/|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\nCyberattacking telecommunication infrastructures have straightforward results. Telecommunication integration is becoming common practice, systems such as voice and IP networks are merging. Everything is being run through the internet because the speeds and storage capabilities are endless. Denial-of-service attacks can be administered as previously mentioned, but more complex attacks can be made on BGP routing protocols or DNS infrastructures. It is less likely that an attack would target or compromise the traditional telephony network of SS7 switches, or an attempted attack on physical devices such as microwave stations or satellite facilities. The ability would still be there to shut down those physical facilities to disrupt telephony networks. The whole idea on these cyber-attacks is to cut people off from one another, to disrupt communication, and by doing so, to impede critical information being sent and received. In cyberwarfare, this is a critical way of gaining the upper-hand in a conflict. By controlling the flow of information and communication, a nation can plan more accurate strikes and enact better counter-attack measures on their enemies.\n\n=== Transportation ===\nTransportation infrastructure mirrors telecommunication facilities; by impeding transportation for individuals in a city or region, the economy will slightly degrade over time. Successful cyber-attacks can impact scheduling and accessibility, creating a disruption in the economic chain. Carrying methods will be impacted, making it hard for cargo to be sent from one place to another. In January 2003 during the \"slammer\" virus, Continental Airlines was forced to shut down flights due to computer problems.<ref name=lyons /> Cyberterrorists can target railroads by disrupting switches, target flight software to impede airplanes, and target road usage to impede more conventional transportation methods. In May 2015, a man, Chris Roberts, who was a cyberconsultant, revealed to the FBI that he had repeatedly, from 2011 to 2014, managed to hack into Boeing and Airbus flights' controls via the onboard entertainment system, allegedly, and had at least once ordered a flight to climb. The FBI, after detaining him in April 2015 in Syracuse, had interviewed him about the allegations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/17/us/fbi-hacker-flight-computer-systems/index.html|title=FBI: Hacker claimed to have taken over flight's engine controls|work=CNN|date=18 May 2015|author=Evan Perez}}</ref>\n\n=== Water ===\nWater as an infrastructure could be one of the most critical infrastructures to be attacked. It is seen as one of the greatest security hazards among all of the computer-controlled systems. There is the potential to have massive amounts of water unleashed into an area which could be unprotected causing loss of life and property damage. It is not even water supplies that could be attacked; sewer systems can be compromised too. There was no calculation given to the cost of damages, but the estimated cost to replace critical water systems could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.<ref name=lyons /> Most of these water infrastructures are well developed making it hard for cyber-attacks to cause any significant damage, at most, equipment failure can occur causing power outlets to be disrupted for a short time.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Asset (computing)]]\n* [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]]\n* [[Computer emergency response team]]\n* [[Computer insecurity]]\n* [[Computer security]]\n* [[Contingency plan]]\n* [[Countermeasure (computer)]]\n* [[Exploit (computer security)]]\n* [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]]\n* [[Hacking: The Art of Exploitation Second Edition]]\n* [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]\n* [[Information technology security audit]]\n* [[Information Security]]\n* [[Intrusion detection system]]\n* [[IT risk]]\n* [[Metasploit]]\n* [[Month of Bugs]]\n* [[National Information Assurance Glossary]]\n* [[Network lateral movement]]\n* [[Penetration test]]\n* [[Risk factor (computing)|Risk factor]]\n* [[Security controls|Security control]]\n* [[Security service (telecommunication)]]\n* [[Threat (computer)|Threat]]\n* [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability]]\n* [[Vulnerability management]]\n* [[w3af|Web application attack and audit framework]] (w3af)\n* [[List of cyber-attacks]]\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Security controls]]\n* [[Security management]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Sanaei, M.

It denies an opponent's ability to do the same, while employing [[cyberweapon|technological instruments of war]] to attack an opponent's critical computer systems. Cyberterrorism, on the other hand, is \"the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population\".<ref>Lewis, James. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Assessing the Risks of Cyber Terrorism, Cyber War and Other Cyber Threats. Washington, D.C.: , 2002. Web.</ref> That means the end result of both cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism is the same, to damage critical infrastructures and computer systems linked together within the confines of cyberspace.\n\nThe financial crime expert Veit Buetterlin explained that organizations, including state actors, which cannot finance themselves through trade because of imposed sanctions, conduct cyber attacks on banks to generate funds.<ref>https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/living-markets/videos/fighting-war-against-terrorist-financing</ref>\n\n== Factors ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2014}}\nThree factors contribute to why cyber-attacks are launched against a state or an individual: the fear factor, spectacularity factor, and vulnerability factor.\n\n=== Spectacularity factor ===\nThe spectacularity factor is a measure of the actual damage achieved by an attack, meaning that the attack creates direct losses (usually loss of availability or loss of income) and garners negative publicity. On 8 February 2000, a Denial of Service attack severely reduced traffic to many major sites, including Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, and eBay (the attack continued to affect still other sites the next day).<ref name = \"DOS_ex\">{{cite web|url=https://www.garykessler.net/library/ddos.html|title=Distributed Denial-Of-Service|website=www.garykessler.net}}</ref> Amazon reportedly estimated the loss of business at $600,000.<ref name = \"DOS_ex\" />\n\n=== Vulnerability factor ===\nVulnerability factor exploits how vulnerable an organization or government establishment is to cyber-attacks. Organizations without maintenance systems might be running on old servers which are more vulnerable than updated systems. An organization can be vulnerable to a denial of service attack and a government establishment can be defaced on a web page. A computer network attack disrupts the integrity or authenticity of data, usually through malicious code that alters program logic that controls data, leading to errors in output.<ref name=linden>Linden, Edward. Focus on Terrorism. New York: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], 2007. Web.</ref>\n\n== Professional hackers to cyberterrorists ==\n{{original research|section|date=March 2015}}\nProfessional hackers, either working on their own or employed by government agencies or the military, can find computer systems with vulnerabilities lacking the appropriate security software. Once those vulnerabilities are found, they can infect systems with malicious code and then remotely control the system or computer by sending commands to view content or to disrupt other computers. There needs to be a pre-existing system flaw within the computer such as no antivirus protection or faulty system configuration for the viral code to work.\n\nMany professional hackers will promote themselves to cyberterrorists, where a new set of rules govern their actions. Cyberterrorists have premeditated plans and their attacks are not born of rage.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} They need to develop their plans step-by-step and acquire the appropriate software to carry out an attack. They usually have political agendas, targeting political structures. Cyberterrorists are hackers with a political motivation, their attacks can impact political structure through this corruption and destruction.<ref name=prichard>Prichard, Janet, and Laurie MacDonald. \"Cyber Terrorism: A Study of the Extent of Coverage in Computer Security Textbooks.\" Journal of Information Technology Education. 3. (2004): n. page. Web.</ref>  They also target civilians, civilian interests and civilian installations. As previously stated cyberterrorists attack persons or property and cause enough harm to generate fear.\n\n== Types of attack ==\nAn attack can be ''active'' or ''passive''.<ref name=rfc2828/>\n\n: An \"active attack\" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.\n: A \"[[passive attack]]\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources (e.g., [[telephone tapping|wiretapping]]).\nAn attack can be perpetrated by an ''insider'' or from'' outside'' the organization;<ref name=rfc2828/>\n: An \"inside attack\" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an \"insider\"), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization.\n: An \"outside attack\" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an \"outsider\"). In the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments.\n\nThe term \"attack\" relates to some other basic security terms as shown in the following diagram:<ref name=rfc2828/>\n\n<pre>\n      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+\n      | An Attack:              |  |Counter- |  | A System Resource:   |\n      | i.e., A Threat Action   |  | measure |  | Target of the Attack |\n      | +----------+            |  |         |  | +-----------------+  |\n      | | Attacker |<==================||<=========                 |  |\n      | |   i.e.,  |   Passive  |  |         |  | |  Vulnerability  |  |\n      | | A Threat |<=================>||<========>                 |  |\n      | |  Agent   |  or Active |  |         |  | +-------|||-------+  |\n      | +----------+   Attack   |  |         |  |         VVV          |\n      |                         |  |         |  | Threat Consequences  |\n      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+\n</pre>\n\nA resource (both physical or logical), called an [[asset (computing)|asset]], can have one or more [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] that can be [[Exploit (computer security)|exploited]] by a [[Threat (computer)|threat]] agent in a threat action. As a result, the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] of resources may be compromised. Potentially, the damage may extend to resources in addition to the one initially identified as vulnerable, including further resources of the organization, and the resources of other involved parties (customers, suppliers).\n\nThe so-called [[CIA triad]] is the basis of [[information security]].\n\nThe attack can be ''active'' when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A \"''passive attack''\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises confidentiality.\n\nA threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either \"intentional\" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or \"accidental\" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an \"act of God\" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).<ref name=rfc2828/>\n\nA set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[information security management system]]s (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[risk management]] principles, the [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.<ref name=Vacca>{{cite book\n|last= Wright\n|first=Joe\n|author2=Jim Harmening\n|editor-last=Vacca\n|editor-first=John\n|title=Computer and Information Security Handbook\n|series=Morgan Kaufmann Publications\n|year=2009\n|publisher= Elsevier Inc\n|isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1\n|page=257\n|chapter=15\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAn attack should led to a ''security incident'' i.e. a ''security event'' that involves a ''security violation''.

Attacks are broken down into two categories: syntactic attacks and semantic attacks. '''Syntactic attacks''' are straightforward; it is considered malicious software which includes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.\n\n=== Syntactic attacks ===\n==== Viruses ====\n{{Main|Computer virus}}\nA virus is a self-replicating program that can attach itself to another program or file in order to reproduce. The virus can hide in unlikely locations in the memory of a computer system and attach itself to whatever file it sees fit to execute its code. It can also change its digital footprint each time it replicates making it harder to track down in the computer.\n\n==== Worms ====\n{{Main|Computer worm}}\nA worm does not need another file or program to copy itself; it is a self-sustaining running program. Worms replicate over a network using protocols. The latest incarnation of worms make use of known vulnerabilities in systems to penetrate, execute their code, and replicate to other systems such as the Code Red II worm that infected more than 259 000 systems in less than 14 hours.<ref>Janczewski, Lech, and Andrew Colarik. Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism. Hershey, New York: Information Science Reference, 2008. Web.</ref> On a much larger scale, worms can be designed for industrial espionage to monitor and collect server and traffic activities then transmit it back to its creator.\n\n==== Trojan horses ====\n{{Main|Trojan horse (computing)}}\nA Trojan horse is designed to perform legitimate tasks but it also performs unknown and unwanted activity. It can be the basis of many viruses and worms installing onto the computer as keyboard loggers and backdoor software. In a commercial sense, Trojans can be imbedded in trial versions of software and can gather additional intelligence about the target without the person even knowing it happening. All three of these are likely to attack an individual and establishment through emails, web browsers, chat clients, remote software, and updates.\n\n=== Semantic attacks ===\n'''Semantic attack''' is the modification and dissemination of correct and incorrect information. Information modified could have been done without the use of computers even though new opportunities can be found by using them. To set someone into the wrong direction or to cover your tracks, the dissemination of incorrect information can be utilized.\n\n==== India and Pakistan ====\n{{Main|India\u2013Pakistan relations}}\nThere were two such instances between India and Pakistan that involved cyberspace conflicts, started in 1990s. Earlier cyber attacks came to known as early as in 1999.<ref name=prichard /> Since then, India and Pakistan were engaged in a long-term dispute over Kashmir which moved into [[cyberspace]]. Historical accounts indicated that each country's hackers have been repeatedly involved in attacking each other's computing database system. The number of attacks has grown yearly: 45 in 1999, 133 in 2000, 275 by the end of August 2001.<ref name=prichard /> In 2010, Indian hackers laid a cyber attack at least 36 government database websites going by the name \"Indian Cyber Army\".<ref name=\"Express Tirbune\">{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Indian Army|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/83967/36-government-websites-hacked-by-indian-cyber-army/|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tirbune|date=30 November 2010}}</ref> In 2013, Indian hackers hacked the official website of [[Election Commission of Pakistan|Election Commission]] of Pakistan in an attempt to retrieve sensitive database information.<ref name=\"The News International 2013\" /> In retaliation, Pakistani hackers, calling themselves \"True Cyber Army\" hacked and defaced ~1,059 websites of Indian election bodies.<ref name=\"The News International 2013\">{{cite news|last=Waseem Abbasi|title=Pakistani hackers defaced over 1,000 Indian websites|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-22095-Pakistani-hackers-defaced-over-1000-Indian-websites|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The News International 2013|date=6 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the media, Pakistan's has been working on effective [[cyber security]] system, in a program called the \"Cyber Secure Pakistan\" (CSP).<ref name=\"The News International, April 2013\">{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cyber Secure Pakistan' initiative launched|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-6-172840-Cyber-Secure-Pakistan-initiative-launched|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=The News International, April 2013|date=22 April 2013}}</ref>  The program was launched in April 2013 by Pakistan Information Security Association and the program has expanded to country's universities.\n\n== Cyberattacks by and against countries ==\nWithin cyberwarfare, the individual must recognize the state actors involved in committing these cyber-attacks against one another. The two predominant players that will be discussed is the age-old [[East\u2013West dichotomy|comparison of East versus West]], China's cyber capabilities compared to United States' capabilities. There are many other state and non-state actors involved in cyberwarfare, such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Al Qaeda; since China and the U.S. are leading the foreground in cyberwarfare capabilities, they will be the only two state actors discussed.\n\nBut in Q2 2013, [[Akamai Technologies]] reported that Indonesia toppled China with portion 38 percent of cyber attack, a high increase from 21 percent portion in previous quarter. China set 33 percent and US set at 6.9 percent. 79 percent of attack came from Asia Pacific region. Indonesia dominated the attacking to ports 80 and 443 by about 90 percent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425836,00.asp |title=Indonesia Tops China as Cyber Attack Capital |date=16 October 2013 | work=PC Magazine}}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\n{{Main|Cyberwarfare in China}}\n{{more citations needed|section, except for one footnote, | date= July 2013}}\nChina's [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) has developed a strategy called \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare\" which guides computer network operations and [[cyberwarfare]] tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance.<ref name=\"krekel\" /> ''The Science of Military'' and ''The Science of Campaigns'' both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyber-attacks and states that cyberwarfare must mark the start if a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success.<ref name=krekel>Krekel, Bryan. People's Republic of China. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation . Virginia: Northrop Grumman, 2009. Web.</ref> Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, electronic deception and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all in the hopes of destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's ''Science of Campaigns'' noted that one role for cyberwarfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of \"blindness\", \"deafness\" or \"paralysis\" created by cyber-attacks.<ref name=krekel /> That is one of the main focal points of cyberwarefare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success.\n\nThe PLA conduct regular training exercises in a variety of environments emphasizing the use of cyberwarfare tactics and techniques in countering such tactics if it is employed against them.  Faculty research has been focusing on designs for rootkit usage and detection for their Kylin Operating System which helps to further train these individuals' cyberwarfare techniques. China perceives cyberwarfare as a deterrent to nuclear weapons, possessing the ability for greater precision, leaving fewer casualties, and allowing for long ranged attacks.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2019}}\n{{See also|Office of Personnel Management data breach|Vault 7}}\nIn the West, the [[United States]] provides a different \"tone of voice\" when cyberwarfare is on the tip of everyone's tongue. The United States provides security plans strictly in the response to cyberwarfare, basically going on the defensive when they are being attacked by devious cyber methods. In the U.S., the responsibility of cybersecurity is divided between the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. In recent years, a new department was created to specifically tend to cyber threats, this department is known as Cyber Command. Cyber Command is a military subcommand under US Strategic Command and is responsible for dealing with threats to the military cyber infrastructure. Cyber Command's service elements include Army Forces Cyber Command, the Twenty-fourth Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command.<ref>Lewis, James, and Katrina Timlin. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cybersecurity and Cyberwarfare: Preliminary Assessment of National Doctrine and Organization. Washington, D.C.: , 2011. Web.</ref> It ensures that the President can navigate and control information systems and that he also has military options available when defense of the nation needs to be enacted in cyberspace. Individuals at Cyber Command must pay attention to state and non-state actors who are developing cyberwarfare capabilities in conducting cyber espionage and other cyber-attacks against the nation and its allies. Cyber Command seeks to be a deterrence factor to dissuade potential adversaries from attacking the U.S., while being a multi-faceted department in conducting cyber operations of its own.\n\nThree prominent events took place which may have been catalysts in the creation of the idea of Cyber Command. There was a failure of critical infrastructure reported by the CIA where malicious activities against information technology systems disrupted electrical power capabilities overseas. This resulted in multi-city power outages across multiple regions. The second event was the exploitation of global financial services. In November 2008, an international bank had a compromised payment processor that allowed fraudulent transactions to be made at more than 130 automated teller machines in 49 cities within a 30-minute period.<ref>United States. Review Team of Government Cybersecurity Experts. Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information and Communications Infrastructure. Washington, D.C.: , Web.</ref> The last event was the systemic loss of U.S. economic value when an industry in 2008 estimated $1 trillion in losses of intellectual property to data theft. Even though all these events were internal catastrophes, they were very real in nature, meaning nothing can stop state or non-state actors to do the same thing on an even grander scale. Other initiatives like the Cyber Training Advisory Council were created to improve the quality, efficiency, and sufficiency of training for computer network defense, attack, and exploitation of enemy cyber operations.\n\nOn both ends of the spectrum, East and West nations show a \"sword and shield\" contrast in ideals. The Chinese have a more offensive minded idea for cyberwarfare, trying to get the pre-emptive strike in the early stages of conflict to gain the upper-hand. In the U.S. there are more reactionary measures being taken at creating systems with impenetrable barriers to protect the nation and its civilians from cyber-attacks.\n\nAccording to ''Homeland Preparedness News'', many mid-sized U.S. companies have a difficult time defending their systems against cyber attacks. Around 80 percent of assets vulnerable to a cyber attack are owned by private companies and organizations. Former New York State Deputy Secretary for Public Safety Michael Balboni said that private entities \"do not have the type of capability, bandwidth, interest or experience to develop a proactive cyber analysis.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/18834-expert-work-needed-get-private-sector-cyber-secure/|title=Expert: More work needed to get private sector cyber secure|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-05-19|website=Homeland Preparedness News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}</ref>\n\nIn response to cyber-attacks on 1 April 2015, President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the first-ever economic sanctions. The Executive Order will impact individuals and entities (\"designees\") responsible for cyber-attacks that threaten the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the US. Specifically, the Executive Order authorizes the Treasury Department to freeze designees' assets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sanctions-cyber-crime.pdf |title= Sanctions: U.S. action on cyber crime |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ted Koppel]]'s book, in 2008, the United States in collaboration with Israel, ran a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program, becoming \"the first to use a digital weapon as an instrument of policy\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lights out : a cyberattack, a nation unprepared, surviving the aftermath|last=8-|first=Koppel, Ted, 1940 February|isbn=9780553419962|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=910424314|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Ukraine ===\n{{Main|2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine}}\nA series of powerful cyber attacks began 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.\n\n=== Russia ===\nDuring the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Russia countered and stopped around 25 million cyber attacks on IT Infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/433300-russia-world-cup-cyber-attacks/|title=Russia blocked 25mn cyber attacks on IT infrastructure during World Cup \u2013 Putin|work=RT International|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, [[Russia]] has conceded that it is \"possible\" its [[Electricity sector in Russia|electrical grid]] is under cyberattack by the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news |title=US and Russia clash over power grid 'hack attacks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48675203 |publisher=BBC News |date=18 June 2019}}</ref> The ''New York Times'' reported that American hackers from the [[United States Cyber Command]] planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Not To Prevent a Cyberwar With Russia |url=https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cyberwar-escalation-power-grid/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Estonia ===\n{{main|2007 cyberattacks on Estonia}}\nThe 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia were a series of cyberattacks which began on 27 April 2007 and targeted websites of [[Estonia]]n organizations, including [[Riigikogu|Estonian parliament]], banks, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters, amid the country's disagreement with [[Russia]] about the relocation of the [[Bronze Soldier of Tallinn]], an elaborate Soviet-era grave marker, as well as war graves in [[Tallinn]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 May 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2081438,00.html |title=Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia |author=Ian Traynor}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=War in the fifth domain.

Certain infrastructures as targets have been highlighted as critical infrastructures in times of conflict that can severely cripple a nation. Control systems, energy resources, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and water facilities are seen as critical infrastructure targets during conflict. A new report on the industrial cybersecurity problems, produced by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and the PA Consulting Group, using data from as far back as 1981, reportedly{{weasel inline|date=May 2013}} has found a 10-fold increase in the number of successful cyber-attacks on infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems since 2000.<ref name=linden /> Cyberattacks that have an adverse physical effect are known as cyber-physical attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Loukas|first1=George|date = June 2015|title=Cyber-Physical Attacks A growing invisible threat|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2818550|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Butterworh-Heinemann (Elsevier)|page = 65 |isbn= 9780128012901}}</ref>\n\n=== Control systems ===\nControl systems are responsible for activating and monitoring industrial or mechanical controls. Many devices are integrated with computer platforms to control valves and gates to certain physical infrastructures. Control systems are usually designed as remote telemetry devices that link to other physical devices through internet access or modems. Little security can be offered when dealing with these devices, enabling many hackers or cyberterrorists to seek out systematic vulnerabilities. Paul Blomgren, manager of sales engineering at cybersecurity firm explained how his people drove to a remote substation, saw a wireless network antenna and immediately plugged in their wireless LAN cards. They took out their laptops and connected to the system because it wasn't using passwords. \"Within 10 minutes, they had mapped every piece of equipment in the facility,\" Blomgren said. \"Within 15 minutes, they mapped every piece of equipment in the operational control network. Within 20 minutes, they were talking to the business network and had pulled off several business reports. They never even left the vehicle.\"<ref name=lyons>Lyons, Marty. United States. Homeland Security. Threat Assessment of Cyber Warfare. Washington, D.C.: , 2005. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Energy ===\nEnergy is seen as the second infrastructure that could be attacked. It is broken down into two categories, electricity and natural gas. '''Electricity''' also known as electric grids power cities, regions, and households; it powers machines and other mechanisms used in day-to-day life. Using US as an example, in a conflict cyberterrorists can access data through the Daily Report of System Status that shows power flows throughout the system and can pinpoint the busiest sections of the grid. By shutting those grids down, they can cause mass hysteria, backlog, and confusion; also being able to locate critical areas of operation to further attacks in a more direct method. Cyberterrorists can access instructions on how to connect to the Bonneville Power Administration which helps direct them on how to not fault the system in the process. This is a major advantage that can be utilized when cyber-attacks are being made because foreign attackers with no prior knowledge of the system can attack with the highest accuracy without drawbacks. Cyberattacks on '''natural gas''' installations go much the same way as it would with attacks on electrical grids. Cyberterrorists can shutdown these installations stopping the flow or they can even reroute gas flows to another section that can be occupied by one of their allies. There was a case in Russia with a gas supplier known as Gazprom, they lost control of their central switchboard which routes gas flow, after an inside operator and Trojan horse program bypassed security.<ref name=lyons />\n\n=== Finance ===\nFinancial infrastructures could be hit hard by cyber-attacks as the financial system is linked by computer systems.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\"/> Money is constantly being exchanged in these institutions and if cyberterrorists were to attack and if transactions were rerouted and large amounts of money stolen, financial industries would collapse and civilians would be without jobs and security. Operations would stall from region to region causing nationwide economic degradation. In the U.S. alone, the average daily volume of transactions hit $3 trillion and 99% of it is non-cash flow.<ref name=lyons /> To be able to disrupt that amount of money for one day or for a period of days can cause lasting damage making investors pull out of funding and erode public confidence.\n\nA cyberattack on a financial institution or transactions may be referred to as a '''cyberheist'''. These attacks may start with phishing that targets employees, using [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to coax information from them. They may allow attackers to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into the network and put [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]]s on the [[Accounting information system|accounting systems]]. In time, the cybercriminals are able to obtain password and keys information. An organization's bank accounts can then be accessed via the information they have stolen using the keyloggers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/avoid_windows_malware_bank_on.html |title=Security Fix - Avoid Windows Malware: Bank on a Live CD |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref> In May 2013, a gang carried out a US$40 million cyberheist from the [[Bank of Muscat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinenewsoman.com/2013/05/17/indian-companies-at-center-of-global-cyber-heist/|title=Indian Companies at Center of Global Cyber Heist|website=onlinenewsoman.com|access-date=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231074756/http://onlinenewsoman.com/2013/05/17/indian-companies-at-center-of-global-cyber-heist/|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\nCyberattacking telecommunication infrastructures have straightforward results. Telecommunication integration is becoming common practice, systems such as voice and IP networks are merging. Everything is being run through the internet because the speeds and storage capabilities are endless. Denial-of-service attacks can be administered as previously mentioned, but more complex attacks can be made on BGP routing protocols or DNS infrastructures. It is less likely that an attack would target or compromise the traditional telephony network of SS7 switches, or an attempted attack on physical devices such as microwave stations or satellite facilities. The ability would still be there to shut down those physical facilities to disrupt telephony networks. The whole idea on these cyber-attacks is to cut people off from one another, to disrupt communication, and by doing so, to impede critical information being sent and received. In cyberwarfare, this is a critical way of gaining the upper-hand in a conflict. By controlling the flow of information and communication, a nation can plan more accurate strikes and enact better counter-attack measures on their enemies.\n\n=== Transportation ===\nTransportation infrastructure mirrors telecommunication facilities; by impeding transportation for individuals in a city or region, the economy will slightly degrade over time. Successful cyber-attacks can impact scheduling and accessibility, creating a disruption in the economic chain. Carrying methods will be impacted, making it hard for cargo to be sent from one place to another. In January 2003 during the \"slammer\" virus, Continental Airlines was forced to shut down flights due to computer problems.<ref name=lyons /> Cyberterrorists can target railroads by disrupting switches, target flight software to impede airplanes, and target road usage to impede more conventional transportation methods. In May 2015, a man, Chris Roberts, who was a cyberconsultant, revealed to the FBI that he had repeatedly, from 2011 to 2014, managed to hack into Boeing and Airbus flights' controls via the onboard entertainment system, allegedly, and had at least once ordered a flight to climb. The FBI, after detaining him in April 2015 in Syracuse, had interviewed him about the allegations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/17/us/fbi-hacker-flight-computer-systems/index.html|title=FBI: Hacker claimed to have taken over flight's engine controls|work=CNN|date=18 May 2015|author=Evan Perez}}</ref>\n\n=== Water ===\nWater as an infrastructure could be one of the most critical infrastructures to be attacked. It is seen as one of the greatest security hazards among all of the computer-controlled systems. There is the potential to have massive amounts of water unleashed into an area which could be unprotected causing loss of life and property damage. It is not even water supplies that could be attacked; sewer systems can be compromised too. There was no calculation given to the cost of damages, but the estimated cost to replace critical water systems could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.<ref name=lyons /> Most of these water infrastructures are well developed making it hard for cyber-attacks to cause any significant damage, at most, equipment failure can occur causing power outlets to be disrupted for a short time.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Asset (computing)]]\n* [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]]\n* [[Computer emergency response team]]\n* [[Computer insecurity]]\n* [[Computer security]]\n* [[Contingency plan]]\n* [[Countermeasure (computer)]]\n* [[Exploit (computer security)]]\n* [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]]\n* [[Hacking: The Art of Exploitation Second Edition]]\n* [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]\n* [[Information technology security audit]]\n* [[Information Security]]\n* [[Intrusion detection system]]\n* [[IT risk]]\n* [[Metasploit]]\n* [[Month of Bugs]]\n* [[National Information Assurance Glossary]]\n* [[Network lateral movement]]\n* [[Penetration test]]\n* [[Risk factor (computing)|Risk factor]]\n* [[Security controls|Security control]]\n* [[Security service (telecommunication)]]\n* [[Threat (computer)|Threat]]\n* [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability]]\n* [[Vulnerability management]]\n* [[w3af|Web application attack and audit framework]] (w3af)\n* [[List of cyber-attacks]]\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Security controls]]\n* [[Security management]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Sanaei, M.

It is located in [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile and has approximately 14,000 students.\n\nPUCV attracts students from different areas of [[Chile]], as well as hundreds of exchange students from Europe, North America and several countries from South America, due to its convenient student exchange programs. It is recognized as a traditional institution with high academic prestige and as a complex university due to its important research and educational development in the fields of science, engineering, humanities and arts. As a [[Catholic university]], it answers directly to the [[Holy See]] and the [[Bishopric]] of Valpara\u00edso. It is a private university with state support.\n\nPUCV is an urban university. It has a central campus known as ''Casa Central'' (Central House) located in downtown [[Valpara\u00edso]], only a few blocks away from the [[Chilean Congress]], the Metro, and the Pacific Ocean. One of the drawbacks of being an urban university is the difficulty of growing at the original site of its foundation.

PUCV architects have a reputation for being highly creative, having studied at a school that mixes the architectural design and building processes with poetry and physical activities. Similarly, in the [[Quillota]] campus the program in horticulture is offered within an experimental station. This campus is visited by more than 1,500 people each year, and has outstanding collections of subtropical and temperate fruit trees, a nursery. The station of 500,000 square metres has more than 50,000 square metres of greenhouses.\n\nThe diversity of the PUCV is one of its strengths, with a [[rainbow trout]] farm near Los Andes, a legislative consultancy group (CEAL), a farm in [[Quillota]] with an area of 6&nbsp;km\u00b2, a fruit packing house specialized in avocados and citrus fruits (joint venture with Exportadora Santa Cruz), a TV station, that has been on the air since 1957 (the first in the country), a radio station, a publishing house, and an experimental grade school and high school for boys in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]]. All of these units welcome interns and scholars, both from PUCV and other universities.\n\nThe PUCV houses the editorial offices of journals in marine biology, law, religion, philosophy, psychology, and biotechnology. Explora, a special government program to promote science in primary and secondary schools, is also hosted by the PUCV.\n\n==History==\nIt was founded in March 1928, supported by the generous contribution of Isabel Caces de Brown. Even older, the Law School was established in 1894 as an independent college by the Sacred Heart Fathers, and was later incorporated into the University (since both were units of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]). The first undergraduate majors offered by the PUCV were electrical engineering, construction, chemistry, mining, business administration, mechanical engineering, decorative arts, and merchant marine studies.\n\nThe [[Pontifical university|Pontifical]] title was conferred by [[Pope John Paul II]] and announced at the inauguration of the 2003 academic year by [[Zenon Grocholewski]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]].\n\n==Administration==\n\nPUCV is a private institution dependent upon the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. As some other old private universities in [[Chile]], PUCV receives some funding from the Chilean government. PUCV's Grand Chancellor is the Bishop of Valpara\u00edso, who appoints representatives in the Academic Council but does not directly run the University (responsibility of a faculty-elected [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]). The Council includes the Deans of each faculty, all of whom are elected by the faculty.\n\nThe appointment of PUCV officers and structural changes in its administration need the approval of the [[Holy See]], with periodic reviews by the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. Doctoral [[honoris causa]] degrees need to be approved by the Congregation.\n\n==Faculties and undergraduate programs==\nCurrently, PUCV has 63 undergraduate programs, 15 doctorate programs, 35 master programs and 82 other postgraduate programs.\n\n*Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism\n**[http://www.arte.ucv.cl Art,] [http://www.ead.pucv.cl Architecture, Graphic Design, Industrial Design]\n*[http://www.agronomia.ucv.cl/ Faculty of Agriculture]\n**Fruit Science, Vegetable Crops and Ornamentals, Environmental Management, [http://www.alimentos.ucv.cl Food Technology]\n*Faculty of Science\n**[http://ima.ucv.cl/ Mathematics], Statistics, Biology, Physics, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030827055033/http://www.institutoquimica.ucv.cl/ Chemistry]\n*Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences\n**[http://www.ingcomercial.ucv.cl/ Management], Accounting, Social Work, [http://www.periodismoucv.cl/ Journalism]\n*[http://www.ingenieria.ucv.cl/ Faculty of Engineering]\n**[http://www.eib.cl Biochemical Eng], Chemical Eng, Civil Eng, Computing Eng, Construction Eng, [http://eie.ucv.cl/ Electrical and Electronic Eng], Industrial Eng, Mechanical Eng, [http://www.itra.ucv.cl Transportation Eng,]\n*Faculty of Law\n**[http://www.derecho.ucv.cl Law]\n*[https://archive.is/20130102015223/http://www.frn.ucv.cl/ Faculty of Natural Resources]\n**[http://www.geografia.ucv.cl/ Geography], Oceanography, [http://www.ecm.ucv.cl Aquaculture and Fisheries]\n*Faculty of Philosophy and Education\n**[http://www.filosofia.ucv.cl Philosophy], Psychology, Education, Special Education, Physical Education, History, Spanish and English, [http://www.institutodemusica.ucv.cl Music]\n*Ecclesiastical Faculty of Theology \u2013 [http://www.cienciasreligiosas.ucv.cl/ Institute of Religious Studies]\n**Religious Studies\n\n==International relations==\n\nPUCV has a long history of academic relations with institutions all over the world, with more than 260 agreements concentrated in European universities.

The station of 500,000 square metres has more than 50,000 square metres of greenhouses.\n\nThe diversity of the PUCV is one of its strengths, with a [[rainbow trout]] farm near Los Andes, a legislative consultancy group (CEAL), a farm in [[Quillota]] with an area of 6&nbsp;km\u00b2, a fruit packing house specialized in avocados and citrus fruits (joint venture with Exportadora Santa Cruz), a TV station, that has been on the air since 1957 (the first in the country), a radio station, a publishing house, and an experimental grade school and high school for boys in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]]. All of these units welcome interns and scholars, both from PUCV and other universities.\n\nThe PUCV houses the editorial offices of journals in marine biology, law, religion, philosophy, psychology, and biotechnology. Explora, a special government program to promote science in primary and secondary schools, is also hosted by the PUCV.\n\n==History==\nIt was founded in March 1928, supported by the generous contribution of Isabel Caces de Brown. Even older, the Law School was established in 1894 as an independent college by the Sacred Heart Fathers, and was later incorporated into the University (since both were units of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]). The first undergraduate majors offered by the PUCV were electrical engineering, construction, chemistry, mining, business administration, mechanical engineering, decorative arts, and merchant marine studies.\n\nThe [[Pontifical university|Pontifical]] title was conferred by [[Pope John Paul II]] and announced at the inauguration of the 2003 academic year by [[Zenon Grocholewski]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]].\n\n==Administration==\n\nPUCV is a private institution dependent upon the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. As some other old private universities in [[Chile]], PUCV receives some funding from the Chilean government. PUCV's Grand Chancellor is the Bishop of Valpara\u00edso, who appoints representatives in the Academic Council but does not directly run the University (responsibility of a faculty-elected [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]). The Council includes the Deans of each faculty, all of whom are elected by the faculty.\n\nThe appointment of PUCV officers and structural changes in its administration need the approval of the [[Holy See]], with periodic reviews by the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. Doctoral [[honoris causa]] degrees need to be approved by the Congregation.\n\n==Faculties and undergraduate programs==\nCurrently, PUCV has 63 undergraduate programs, 15 doctorate programs, 35 master programs and 82 other postgraduate programs.\n\n*Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism\n**[http://www.arte.ucv.cl Art,] [http://www.ead.pucv.cl Architecture, Graphic Design, Industrial Design]\n*[http://www.agronomia.ucv.cl/ Faculty of Agriculture]\n**Fruit Science, Vegetable Crops and Ornamentals, Environmental Management, [http://www.alimentos.ucv.cl Food Technology]\n*Faculty of Science\n**[http://ima.ucv.cl/ Mathematics], Statistics, Biology, Physics, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030827055033/http://www.institutoquimica.ucv.cl/ Chemistry]\n*Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences\n**[http://www.ingcomercial.ucv.cl/ Management], Accounting, Social Work, [http://www.periodismoucv.cl/ Journalism]\n*[http://www.ingenieria.ucv.cl/ Faculty of Engineering]\n**[http://www.eib.cl Biochemical Eng], Chemical Eng, Civil Eng, Computing Eng, Construction Eng, [http://eie.ucv.cl/ Electrical and Electronic Eng], Industrial Eng, Mechanical Eng, [http://www.itra.ucv.cl Transportation Eng,]\n*Faculty of Law\n**[http://www.derecho.ucv.cl Law]\n*[https://archive.is/20130102015223/http://www.frn.ucv.cl/ Faculty of Natural Resources]\n**[http://www.geografia.ucv.cl/ Geography], Oceanography, [http://www.ecm.ucv.cl Aquaculture and Fisheries]\n*Faculty of Philosophy and Education\n**[http://www.filosofia.ucv.cl Philosophy], Psychology, Education, Special Education, Physical Education, History, Spanish and English, [http://www.institutodemusica.ucv.cl Music]\n*Ecclesiastical Faculty of Theology \u2013 [http://www.cienciasreligiosas.ucv.cl/ Institute of Religious Studies]\n**Religious Studies\n\n==International relations==\n\nPUCV has a long history of academic relations with institutions all over the world, with more than 260 agreements concentrated in European universities. Student exchange is most active with universities of Spain, US, France, Germany; a few students are from countries in Latin America. The list of institutions includes some of the oldest universities in the world, such as [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]] (founded in 1425 by [[Pope Martin V]]), [[Universit\u00e0 di Pisa]] (founded in 1343 by [[Pope Clement VI]]) and [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]].\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n*Bishop [[Carlos Camus]], a human rights leader during [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s dictatorship.\n*[[Alejandro Foxley]], economist and politician, Foreign Affairs Minister in [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s government.\n*Jorge Mart\u00ednez Busch, former commander-in-chief of the Chilean Navy, as well as an appointed senator in the [[Senate of Chile]] from 1998 to March 2006, when a reform of the [[Constitution of Chile]] put an end to non-democratic senators.\n*Amable Padilla, former Ambassador of the [[Dominican Republic]] to [[Chile]]\n*[[Ricardo Ezzati Andrello]], [[Archbishop of Santiago (Chile)|Archbishop of Santiago]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso|Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso}}\n*[http://www.pucv.cl Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso Website]\n\n{{Chilean Traditional Universities}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pontifical Catholic University Of Valparaiso}}\n[[Category:Catholic universities and colleges in Chile]]\n[[Category:Pontifical universities]]\n[[Category:Universities in Chile|Valparaiso]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1928]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Chile]]\n[[Category:Universities in Valpara\u00edso Region]]\n[[Category:1928 establishments in Chile]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Catholic_University_of_Valpara%C3%ADso"}

The campuses in Santiago are:\n* Casa Central (in downtown [[Santiago]])\n* San Joaqu\u00edn (in [[Macul]] Commune of Greater Santiago)\n* Oriente (in [[\u00d1u\u00f1oa, Chile \u00d1u\u00f1oa]] Commune of Greater Santiago)\n* Lo Contador (also in Providencia Commune)\n\nThese four campuses have a total of 223,326.06 m<sup>2</sup> constructed in a 614,569.92 m<sup>2</sup> area. The Villarrica campus has 1,664 m<sup>2</sup> constructed in a 2,362.5 m<sup>2</sup> area.\n\n==History==\nUC was founded on June 21, 1888 by the [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] [[Archbishop]], to offer training in traditional professions (law) and in technological and practical fields such as business, accounting, chemistry, and electricity. Its first chancellor was [[Monsignor]] [[Joaqu\u00edn Larra\u00edn Gandarillas]], and at the very beginning, the university only taught two subjects, [[law]] and [[mathematics]]. Since it is a Pontifical University, it has always had a strong and very close relationship with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. On February 11, 1930, [[Pope Pius XI]] declared it a [[pontifical university]], and in 1931 it was granted full academic autonomy by the Chilean government.\n\nUC is a private, urban, multi-campus university. It is one of the eleven Chilean Catholic universities, and one of the twenty-five institutions within the Rectors' Council (''Consejo de Rectores''), the Chilean state-sponsored university system. It is part of the [[Chilean Traditional Universities|Universities of the Rectors' Council of Chilean Universities]], and although it is not [[state-owned]], a substantial part of its budget is given by state transfers under different programs.\n\nUC's 18 faculties are distributed through four campuses in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and one regional campus located in southern Chile. The technical training centers affiliated with the University are: DUOC, the Rural Life Foundations, the Baviera Foundation, the Catechetical Home and the San Fidel Seminary. These centers carry out technical-academic extension activities in rural and agricultural areas. Other UC activities are a Sports Club, a nationwide television network, and a Clinical Hospital dependent on the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nUC 's Graduates of the School of Architecture (one of the most prominent in Latin America) have also made important contributions to the country with such work as the Central Building (\"Casa Central\") of UC, and the National Library.\n\nTwo of its most important alumni are the Jesuit [[Saint Alberto Hurtado]] and [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], a [[Chilean president]]. Both of them studied in the School of Laws. [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]], current Chilean president, graduated from the university's School of Economics.\n\nIn 2017 the university faced what has been called a \"wave of suicide\" among its students. During 2017 a total of four students have taken their lives up to October, the previous year two students committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garc\u00eda Lorca |first=Macarena |title=El suicidio que remece a la PUC: El fin del sue\u00f1o universitario de Joselyn Lavados|url=http://www.theclinic.cl/2017/10/09/suicidio-remece-la-puc-fin-del-sueno-universitario-joselyn-lavados/ |work=[[The Clinic (newspaper)|The Clinic]] |location=|date=October 9, 2017 |access-date=October 21, 2017|language=Spanish }}</ref> Critics, including [[alumni]], have written about the university's \"lack of concern\" for the suicide of students, an attitude they contrast to the university's staunch [[opposition to abortion]].<ref name=ccoperativa>{{cite news |title= Alumnos critican a la PUC tras suicidio de compa\u00f1era de Ingenier\u00eda Comercial|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/educacion/universidades/alumnos-critican-a-la-puc-tras-suicidio-de-companera-de-ingenieria/2017-09-15/181222.html|work=[[Radio Cooperativa]]|date=September 15, 2017|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> The student union of the university issued a communique expressing feelings of guilt over the issue and the need to take charge.<ref name=ccoperativa/>\n\n==Collaborations==\nThe Department of Industry and System Engineering is engaging [[Stanford Technology Venture Program]] of [[Stanford University]] on a collaboration on innovation and technology ventures.\n\nIn December 2011, the schools of engineering of PUC and the [[University of Notre Dame]] signed an agreement to establish a dual graduate degree in civil engineering and the geological sciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://graduateschool.nd.edu/news/27694-notre-dame-signs-historic-agreement-with-pontificia-universidad-catolica-de-chile-for-graduate-civil-engineering-and-geological-sciences/|title=Notre Dame Signs Historic Agreement For Graduate Studies in Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences|author=CJO // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> which now extends to other departments in both schools.\n\nIn April 2013, PUC and the [[University of Notre Dame]] also signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen scholarly engagement and expand their long-standing relationships.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130718233545/http://international.nd.edu/news/39642-notre-dame-to-expand-exchange-with-chiles-pontifical-catholic-university/ ]</ref> The agreement establishes an exchange program in which faculty, doctoral students and university representatives from each institution will visit, work, study and collaborate with the other institution.\n\n==World rankings==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 401-500\n| ARWU_W_ref = <ref>[http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017.html Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017]</ref>\n| THE_W =\n| THE_W_ref =\n| QS_W =\n| QS_W_ref =\n}}\nUC ranks among the first 10 Latin-American Universities according to the Shanghai ranking,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/|title=2014 World University Rankings -

The campuses in Santiago are:\n* Casa Central (in downtown [[Santiago]])\n* San Joaqu\u00edn (in [[Macul]] Commune of Greater Santiago)\n* Oriente (in [[\u00d1u\u00f1oa, Chile \u00d1u\u00f1oa]] Commune of Greater Santiago)\n* Lo Contador (also in Providencia Commune)\n\nThese four campuses have a total of 223,326.06 m<sup>2</sup> constructed in a 614,569.92 m<sup>2</sup> area. The Villarrica campus has 1,664 m<sup>2</sup> constructed in a 2,362.5 m<sup>2</sup> area.\n\n==History==\nUC was founded on June 21, 1888 by the [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] [[Archbishop]], to offer training in traditional professions (law) and in technological and practical fields such as business, accounting, chemistry, and electricity. Its first chancellor was [[Monsignor]] [[Joaqu\u00edn Larra\u00edn Gandarillas]], and at the very beginning, the university only taught two subjects, [[law]] and [[mathematics]]. Since it is a Pontifical University, it has always had a strong and very close relationship with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. On February 11, 1930, [[Pope Pius XI]] declared it a [[pontifical university]], and in 1931 it was granted full academic autonomy by the Chilean government.\n\nUC is a private, urban, multi-campus university. It is one of the eleven Chilean Catholic universities, and one of the twenty-five institutions within the Rectors' Council (''Consejo de Rectores''), the Chilean state-sponsored university system. It is part of the [[Chilean Traditional Universities|Universities of the Rectors' Council of Chilean Universities]], and although it is not [[state-owned]], a substantial part of its budget is given by state transfers under different programs.\n\nUC's 18 faculties are distributed through four campuses in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and one regional campus located in southern Chile. The technical training centers affiliated with the University are: DUOC, the Rural Life Foundations, the Baviera Foundation, the Catechetical Home and the San Fidel Seminary. These centers carry out technical-academic extension activities in rural and agricultural areas. Other UC activities are a Sports Club, a nationwide television network, and a Clinical Hospital dependent on the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nUC 's Graduates of the School of Architecture (one of the most prominent in Latin America) have also made important contributions to the country with such work as the Central Building (\"Casa Central\") of UC, and the National Library.\n\nTwo of its most important alumni are the Jesuit [[Saint Alberto Hurtado]] and [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], a [[Chilean president]]. Both of them studied in the School of Laws. [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]], current Chilean president, graduated from the university's School of Economics.\n\nIn 2017 the university faced what has been called a \"wave of suicide\" among its students. During 2017 a total of four students have taken their lives up to October, the previous year two students committed suicide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garc\u00eda Lorca |first=Macarena |title=El suicidio que remece a la PUC: El fin del sue\u00f1o universitario de Joselyn Lavados|url=http://www.theclinic.cl/2017/10/09/suicidio-remece-la-puc-fin-del-sueno-universitario-joselyn-lavados/ |work=[[The Clinic (newspaper)|The Clinic]] |location=|date=October 9, 2017 |access-date=October 21, 2017|language=Spanish }}</ref> Critics, including [[alumni]], have written about the university's \"lack of concern\" for the suicide of students, an attitude they contrast to the university's staunch [[opposition to abortion]].<ref name=ccoperativa>{{cite news |title= Alumnos critican a la PUC tras suicidio de compa\u00f1era de Ingenier\u00eda Comercial|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/educacion/universidades/alumnos-critican-a-la-puc-tras-suicidio-de-companera-de-ingenieria/2017-09-15/181222.html|work=[[Radio Cooperativa]]|date=September 15, 2017|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> The student union of the university issued a communique expressing feelings of guilt over the issue and the need to take charge.<ref name=ccoperativa/>\n\n==Collaborations==\nThe Department of Industry and System Engineering is engaging [[Stanford Technology Venture Program]] of [[Stanford University]] on a collaboration on innovation and technology ventures.\n\nIn December 2011, the schools of engineering of PUC and the [[University of Notre Dame]] signed an agreement to establish a dual graduate degree in civil engineering and the geological sciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://graduateschool.nd.edu/news/27694-notre-dame-signs-historic-agreement-with-pontificia-universidad-catolica-de-chile-for-graduate-civil-engineering-and-geological-sciences/|title=Notre Dame Signs Historic Agreement For Graduate Studies in Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences|author=CJO // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> which now extends to other departments in both schools.\n\nIn April 2013, PUC and the [[University of Notre Dame]] also signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen scholarly engagement and expand their long-standing relationships.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130718233545/http://international.nd.edu/news/39642-notre-dame-to-expand-exchange-with-chiles-pontifical-catholic-university/ ]</ref> The agreement establishes an exchange program in which faculty, doctoral students and university representatives from each institution will visit, work, study and collaborate with the other institution.\n\n==World rankings==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 401-500\n| ARWU_W_ref = <ref>[http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017.html Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017]</ref>\n| THE_W =\n| THE_W_ref =\n| QS_W =\n| QS_W_ref =\n}}\nUC ranks among the first 10 Latin-American Universities according to the Shanghai ranking,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/|title=2014 World University Rankings -

Currently, the university has campuses in other Colombian cities, such as [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Monter\u00eda]] and [[Palmira, Colombia|Palmira]]. As of April, 2018, the university estimated its nationwide student population at 30,000.\n\nPresently the university offers 77 undergraduate programs, 24 master programs and 7 doctorate programs nationwide. The university groups its educational programs under the schools of Architecture And Urbanism, Design, Engineering, Health Sciences, Law and Political Sciences, Strategic Sciences (Management), Social Sciences, Education and Teaching, and Theology, Philosophy and Humanities. The university also operates elementary and high school programs under its educational umbrella.\n\nThe University has several distinguished alumni such as Former [[President of Colombia]] [[Belisario Betancur Cuartas]], and Former [[First Lady of Colombia]] [[Lina Mar\u00eda Moreno Mej\u00eda]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Chapel in Main Entrance.jpg|left|thumb|160px|View of the fa\u00e7ade of the chapel at the University's main entrance showing the seal of the University.]]\nThe University was founded on September 15, 1936, by a decree of the [[Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Medell\u00edn]], Monsignor [[Tiberio de Jes\u00fas Salazar y Herrera]] as the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Bolivariana (UCB, Catholic Bolivarian University). The UCB started with a small faculty and 78 students enrolled in the School of Law and with Monsignor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Sierra as its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. In 1945, the university received the title of [[Roman Pontifical|Pontifical]], from the [[Holy See]] under [[Pope Pius XII]]. With the right to use the title of [[Roman Pontifical|Pontifical]], the [[Pope]] became the [[Chancellor|Grand Chancellor]] of the university.\n\nFrom the university's onset, Monsignor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Sierra wanted to anchor the University on the ideals of Christian humanism and those of the Libertador [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].\n\n== Academics ==\n[[File:School of Engineering Mural.jpg|right|thumb|Greek alphabet mural by Pablo Jaramillo in the School of Engineering.]]\nThe university has programs that extend from elementary and high school to undergraduate and postgraduate programs The UPB offers near 71 undergraduate programs, 126 Academic specializations, 26 Master's degree and 9 Doctor's Degree  :\n\nUndergraduate Schools and programs:\n\n===School of Design and Architecture.===\n*[[Architecture]] and [[Urbanism]]\n*[[Graphic Design]]\n*[[Industrial Design]]\n*Fashion and clothing Design\n\n===School of Health Sciences.===\n*[[Medicine]]\n*[[Nursing]]\n\n===School of Strategic Sciences.===\n*Corporate Management\n*International Business Management\n*[[Economics]]\n\n===School of Social Sciences.===\n*Social Communication and Journalism\n*[[Advertising]]\n*[[Psychology]]\n*[[Social work]]\n\n===School of Law and Political Sciences.===\n*[[Law]]\n*[[Political science]]\n\n===School of Education.===\n*Licentiate in Etnoeducation\n*Licentiate in English-Spanish\n*Licentiate in Artistic Education\n\n===School of Engineering.===\n*Digital Entertainment Design Engineering\n*[[Management Engineering]]\n*[[Aeronautical Engineering]]\n*Agroindustrial Engineering\n*[[Electrical Engineering]]\n*[[Electronic Engineering]]\n*[[Industrial Engineering]]\n*[[Nanotechnology Engineering]]\n*[[Mechanical Engineering]]\n*[[Chemical Engineering]]\n*[[Systems Engineering]]\n*[[Telecommunications Engineering]]\n*Textile Engineering\n*Aeronautical management Technology\n\n===School of Theology, Philosophy and Humanities===\n*Literature Studies\n*[[History]]\n*[[Philosophy]]\n*[[Theology]]\n*Licentiate in Philosophy and Letters\n*Licentiate in Religious Education\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:UPB-Polideportivo-Medellin.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Polideportivo [[Medellin]]'s Main Campus.]]\n\nAs of 2006, there were a total of 81 independent research groups across [[Colombia]], which were coordinated by the Integrated Center for the Development of Research (CIDI from its initials in Spanish).
