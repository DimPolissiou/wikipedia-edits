Within a brief period, the three divisions evolved into Fighting, Spotting and Seaplane Patrol Squadrons, respectively. The purpose of air detachments was: \"attack on enemy aircraft, spotting gunfire for surface craft torpedo attack by torpedo planes, demolition, toxic gas and incendiary bomb attack, smoke and gas screen laying, mine and countermining; flare dropping; scouting reconnaissance, patrol and convoy duty; photography, mapping, detection of enemy coastal defenses and mail passenger service.\"<ref>http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206214113/http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp |date=6 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1922 as part of a reorganization combining the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets into the U.S. Fleet, the detachment was renamed Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet.  In 1933, another reorganization established two principal commands: Commander Aircraft Battle Force and Commander Tender-based Aircraft.\n\nCommander, Air Pacific was established during [[World War II]] as the requirements of supporting air combat units widely deployed in the Pacific Ocean area increased.\n\nFinding much inefficiency in the various administrative commands within naval aviation, [[Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]], Commander in Chief, [[United States Pacific Fleet]] directed a consolidation of various administrative functions for a more efficient command structure.  This new command became Air Pacific Fleet, \"to function as a Type Commander for fleet aircraft, to prepare general policy and doctrine for the operation of aviation units, to recommend the types, characteristics and numbers of aircraft required, and to carry out the strategic distribution of all air units in the Pacific area.\"<ref>http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206214113/http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp |date=6 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 29, 1942, Admiral [[Ernest King]] approved the recommendation and thus established Commander U.S. Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet (COMNAVAIRPAC), effective September 1, 1942. Vice Admiral [[John Henry Towers]] became its commander soon afterwards.\n\nIn May 1949, the headquarters was moved from [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii to [[Naval Air Station, North Island]], California.\n\nOn October 2001, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] redesignated [[Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] (AIRPAC's East Coast counterpart) from a three star command into a two star command and placed it under AIRPAC's command in a \"Lead-Follow\" arrangement.  Under this arrangement COMNAVAIRPAC became TYCOM for Air, and assumed the additional title of Commander, Naval Air Forces (COMNAVAIRFOR).  The Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) and the Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve (COMNAVAIRES) were also subsequently placed under the aegis of COMNAVAIRFOR.\n\n==Past Commanders==\n# Vice Admiral [[John B.

The purpose of air detachments was: \"attack on enemy aircraft, spotting gunfire for surface craft torpedo attack by torpedo planes, demolition, toxic gas and incendiary bomb attack, smoke and gas screen laying, mine and countermining; flare dropping; scouting reconnaissance, patrol and convoy duty; photography, mapping, detection of enemy coastal defenses and mail passenger service.\"<ref>http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206214113/http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp |date=6 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1922 as part of a reorganization combining the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets into the U.S. Fleet, the detachment was renamed Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet.  In 1933, another reorganization established two principal commands: Commander Aircraft Battle Force and Commander Tender-based Aircraft.\n\nCommander, Air Pacific was established during [[World War II]] as the requirements of supporting air combat units widely deployed in the Pacific Ocean area increased.\n\nFinding much inefficiency in the various administrative commands within naval aviation, [[Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]], Commander in Chief, [[United States Pacific Fleet]] directed a consolidation of various administrative functions for a more efficient command structure.  This new command became Air Pacific Fleet, \"to function as a Type Commander for fleet aircraft, to prepare general policy and doctrine for the operation of aviation units, to recommend the types, characteristics and numbers of aircraft required, and to carry out the strategic distribution of all air units in the Pacific area.\"<ref>http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206214113/http://www.cnaf.navy.mil/historycnaf.asp |date=6 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 29, 1942, Admiral [[Ernest King]] approved the recommendation and thus established Commander U.S. Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet (COMNAVAIRPAC), effective September 1, 1942. Vice Admiral [[John Henry Towers]] became its commander soon afterwards.\n\nIn May 1949, the headquarters was moved from [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii to [[Naval Air Station, North Island]], California.\n\nOn October 2001, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] redesignated [[Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] (AIRPAC's East Coast counterpart) from a three star command into a two star command and placed it under AIRPAC's command in a \"Lead-Follow\" arrangement.  Under this arrangement COMNAVAIRPAC became TYCOM for Air, and assumed the additional title of Commander, Naval Air Forces (COMNAVAIRFOR).  The Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) and the Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve (COMNAVAIRES) were also subsequently placed under the aegis of COMNAVAIRFOR.\n\n==Past Commanders==\n# Vice Admiral [[John B.
