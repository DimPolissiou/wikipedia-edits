From the formation of the RAN until 1967, Australian warships used the British [[White Ensign]] as their ensign. However, this led to situations where Australian vessels were mistaken for British ships, and when Australia became involved in the [[Vietnam War]], the RAN was effectively fighting under the flag of another, uninvolved nation. Proposals were made in 1965 for a unique Australian ensign, which was approved in 1966, and entered use in 1967.\n\nThe Australian White Ensign is identical in design to the [[Flag of

He is sometimes seen as the first [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]] composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBorn to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]''.\n\nDebussy's orchestral works include ''[[Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune]]'' (1894), ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' (1897\u20131899) and ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'' (1905\u20131912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical [[symphony]] as obsolete and sought an alternative in his \"symphonic sketches\", ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1903\u20131905). His piano works include two books of [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|Pr\u00e9ludes]] and two of [[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|\u00c9tudes]]. Throughout his career he wrote ''[[m\u00e9lodie]]s'' based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the [[Symbolist]] poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early ''[[La Damoiselle \u00e9lue]]'' and the late ''[[Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien]]'' have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.\n\nWith early influences including Russian and far-eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided \u2013 and unsuccessfully resisted \u2013 by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]], and the jazz pianist and composer [[Bill Evans]]. Debussy died from [[colorectal cancer|cancer]] at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.\n\n== Life and career ==\n[[File:Maison natale de Debussy.jpg|alt=Old postcard showing French street scene in a not very upmarket area|thumb|upright|Rue au Pain, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], street of [[Mus\u00e9e Claude-Debussy|Debussy's birthplace]]]]\n\n=== Early life ===\nDebussy was born on 22 August 1862 in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Seine-et-Oise]], on the north-west fringes of Paris.<ref>Lockspeiser, p. 6; and Trezise (2003), p. xiv</ref>{{refn|Debussy\u2019s birthplace is now a museum dedicated to him.

Writing in 1958, the critic [[Rudolph Reti]] summarised six features of Debussy's music, which he asserted \"established a new concept of tonality in European music\": the frequent use of lengthy [[pedal point]]s \u2013 \"not merely bass pedals in the actual sense of the term, but sustained 'pedals' in any voice\"; glittering passages and webs of figurations which distract from occasional absence of tonality; frequent use of [[parallel chord]]s which are \"in essence not harmonies at all, but rather 'chordal melodies', enriched unisons\", described by some writers as non-functional harmonies; bitonality, or at least [[bitonal]] chords; use of the [[Whole tone scale|whole-tone]] and [[pentatonic scale]]s; and [[unprepared modulation]]s, \"without any harmonic bridge\". Reti concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based \"melodic tonality\" with harmonies, albeit different from those of \"harmonic tonality\".<ref>Reti, pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1889, Debussy held conversations with his former teacher Guiraud, which included exploration of harmonic possibilities at the piano. The discussion, and Debussy's chordal keyboard improvisations, were noted by a younger pupil of Guiraud, Maurice Emmanuel.<ref name=Nichols1980/> The chord sequences played by Debussy include some of the elements identified by Reti. They may also indicate the influence on Debussy of [[Erik Satie|Satie]]'s 1887 ''[[Sarabandes (Satie)|Trois Sarabandes]]''.<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 70\u201373.</ref> A further improvisation by Debussy during this conversation included a sequence of whole tone harmonies which may have been inspired by the music of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]] or [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] which was becoming known in Paris at this time.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 71.</ref> During the conversation, Debussy told Guiraud, \"There is no theory.

According to [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]], Debussy \"did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan',\" although he admitted that it was sometimes difficult to avoid \"the ghost of old [[Parsifal#Act II|Klingsor]], alias Richard Wagner, appearing at the turning of a bar\".<ref name=grove/> After Debussy's short Wagnerian phase, he started to become interested in non-Western music and its unfamiliar approaches to composition.<ref name=grove/> The piano piece ''[[Golliwogg's Cakewalk]]'', from the 1908 suite ''[[Children's Corner]]'', contains a parody of music from the introduction to ''Tristan'', in which, in the opinion of the musicologist [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], Debussy escapes the shadow of the older composer and \"smilingly relativizes Wagner into insignificance\".<ref>De Martelly, Elizabeth.

He wrote incidental music for ''[[King Lear]]'' and planned an opera based on ''[[As You Like It]]'', but abandoned that once he turned his attention to setting Maeterlinck's play.

He is sometimes seen as the first [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]] composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBorn to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]''.\n\nDebussy's orchestral works include ''[[Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune]]'' (1894), ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' (1897\u20131899) and ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'' (1905\u20131912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical [[symphony]] as obsolete and sought an alternative in his \"symphonic sketches\", ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1903\u20131905). His piano works include two books of [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|Pr\u00e9ludes]] and two of [[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|\u00c9tudes]]. Throughout his career he wrote ''[[m\u00e9lodie]]s'' based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the [[Symbolist]] poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early ''[[La Damoiselle \u00e9lue]]'' and the late ''[[Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien]]'' have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.\n\nWith early influences including Russian and far-eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided \u2013 and unsuccessfully resisted \u2013 by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]], and the jazz pianist and composer [[Bill Evans]]. Debussy died from [[colorectal cancer|cancer]] at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.\n\n== Life and career ==\n[[File:Maison natale de Debussy.jpg|alt=Old postcard showing French street scene in a not very upmarket area|thumb|upright|Rue au Pain, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], street of [[Mus\u00e9e Claude-Debussy|Debussy's birthplace]]]]\n\n=== Early life ===\nDebussy was born on 22 August 1862 in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Seine-et-Oise]], on the north-west fringes of Paris.<ref>Lockspeiser, p. 6; and Trezise (2003), p. xiv</ref>{{refn|Debussy\u2019s birthplace is now a museum dedicated to him.

Writing in 1958, the critic [[Rudolph Reti]] summarised six features of Debussy's music, which he asserted \"established a new concept of tonality in European music\": the frequent use of lengthy [[pedal point]]s \u2013 \"not merely bass pedals in the actual sense of the term, but sustained 'pedals' in any voice\"; glittering passages and webs of figurations which distract from occasional absence of tonality; frequent use of [[parallel chord]]s which are \"in essence not harmonies at all, but rather 'chordal melodies', enriched unisons\", described by some writers as non-functional harmonies; bitonality, or at least [[bitonal]] chords; use of the [[Whole tone scale|whole-tone]] and [[pentatonic scale]]s; and [[unprepared modulation]]s, \"without any harmonic bridge\". Reti concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based \"melodic tonality\" with harmonies, albeit different from those of \"harmonic tonality\".<ref>Reti, pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1889, Debussy held conversations with his former teacher Guiraud, which included exploration of harmonic possibilities at the piano. The discussion, and Debussy's chordal keyboard improvisations, were noted by a younger pupil of Guiraud, Maurice Emmanuel.<ref name=Nichols1980/> The chord sequences played by Debussy include some of the elements identified by Reti.

According to [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]], Debussy \"did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan',\" although he admitted that it was sometimes difficult to avoid \"the ghost of old [[Parsifal#Act II|Klingsor]], alias Richard Wagner, appearing at the turning of a bar\".<ref name=grove/> After Debussy's short Wagnerian phase, he started to become interested in non-Western music and its unfamiliar approaches to composition.<ref name=grove/> The piano piece ''[[Golliwogg's Cakewalk]]'', from the 1908 suite ''[[Children's Corner]]'', contains a parody of music from the introduction to ''Tristan'', in which, in the opinion of the musicologist [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], Debussy escapes the shadow of the older composer and \"smilingly relativizes Wagner into insignificance\".<ref>De Martelly, Elizabeth.

The 1904 and 1913 sets have been transferred to compact disc.<ref>Timbrell, p. 261</ref>\n\nContemporaries of Debussy who made recordings of his music, included the pianists [[Ricardo Vi\u00f1es]] (in \"Poissons d'or\" from ''Images'' and \"La soir\u00e9e dans Grenade\" from ''Estampes''); [[Alfred Cortot]] (numerous solo pieces as well as the Violin Sonata with [[Jacques Thibaud]] and the ''Chansons de Bilitis'' with [[Maggie Teyte]]); and [[Marguerite Long]] (\"Jardins sous la pluie\" and \"Arabesques\"). Singers in Debussy's m\u00e9lodies or excerpts from ''Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande'' included [[Jane Bathori]], [[Claire Croiza]], [[Charles Panz\u00e9ra]] and [[Ninon Vallin]]; and among the conductors in the major orchestral works were [[Ernest Ansermet]], [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9-\u00c9mile Inghelbrecht]], [[Pierre Monteux]] and [[Arturo Toscanini]], and in the ''[[Petite Suite (Debussy)|Petite Suite]]'', [[Henri B\u00fcsser]], who had prepared the orchestration for Debussy. Many of these early recordings have been reissued on CD.<ref>Notes to Warner Classics CD 190295642952 (2018)</ref>\n\nIn more recent times Debussy's output has been extensively recorded. In 2018, to mark the centenary of the composer's death, [[Warner Classics]], with contributions from other companies, issued a 33-CD set that is claimed to include all the music Debussy wrote.<ref>Clements, Andrew.

He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable; he began his bombing campaign in 1978. In 1995, he sent a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and promised to \"desist from terrorism\" if the ''Times'' or ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published his essay ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization.\n\nKaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Before his identity was known, the FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (<u>Un</u>iversity and <u>A</u>irline <u>Bom</u>ber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\". The FBI and Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] pushed for the publication of ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', which led to a tip from Kaczynski's brother [[David Kaczynski|David]], who recognized the writing style.\n\nAfter his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, whereas he did not believe that he was insane. In 1998, a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Childhood ===\nTheodore John Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942, in [[Chicago]], Illinois, to working-class, second-generation [[Polish Americans]], Wanda Theresa ([[n\u00e9e]] Dombek) and Theodore Richard Kaczynski,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-14/news/mn-58543_1_ted-kaczynski |title = Adrift in Solitude, Kaczynski Traveled a Lonely Journey |author = Times Staff Writers |website = Los Angeles Times |date = April 14, 1996 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160603130746/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-14/news/mn-58543_1_ted-kaczynski |archivedate = June 3, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> a sausage maker.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Unabomber's family photo album |publisher=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-080302ted-photogallery-photogallery.html |accessdate=May 19, 2019}}</ref> His parents told his younger brother, [[David Kaczynski]], that Ted had been a happy baby until severe [[hives]] forced him into hospital [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] with limited contact with others, after which he \"showed little emotion for months\".<ref name=\"rage\" /> Wanda recalled Ted recoiling from a picture of himself as an infant being held down by physicians examining his hives.

Among the links that raised suspicion was the fact that Kaczynski lived in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] from 1967 to 1969 (the same period that most of the Zodiac's confirmed killings occurred in California), that both individuals were highly intelligent with an interest in bombs and codes, and that both wrote letters to newspapers demanding the publication of their works with the threat of continued violence if the demand was not met. However, Kaczynski's whereabouts could not be verified for all of the killings, and the gun and knife murders committed by the Zodiac Killer differ from Kaczynski's bombings, so he was not further pursued as a suspect.

Between 1978 and 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology. <!--In conjunction with this effort, he issued a social critique opposing industrialization while advocating a [[anarcho-primitivism|nature-centered form of anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lDD1AXpeoW4C&pg=PA199 |title=Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era: NGOs, Social Movements, and Political Parties |isbn=978-0-230-62024-7 |first1=Heather|last1=Gautney |year=2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>--><!-- This sentence doesn't seem to be true -->\n\nIn 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near [[Lincoln, Montana]], where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable; he began his bombing campaign in 1978. In 1995, he sent a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and promised to \"desist from terrorism\" if the ''Times'' or ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published his essay ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization.\n\nKaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Before his identity was known, the FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (<u>Un</u>iversity and <u>A</u>irline <u>Bom</u>ber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\". The FBI and Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] pushed for the publication of ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', which led to a tip from Kaczynski's brother [[David Kaczynski|David]], who recognized the writing style.\n\nAfter his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, whereas he did not believe that he was insane.

[[Robert Graysmith]], author of the 1986 book ''[[Zodiac (true crime book)|Zodiac]]'', said the similarities are \"fascinating\" but purely coincidental.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/05/14/MN44704.DTL&type=printable |title = Kaczynski, Zodiac Killer \u2013 the Same Guy? |last1 = Fagan |first1 = Kevin |last2 = Wallace |first2 = Bill |date = May 14, 1996 |work = San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate = December 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429204619/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F1996%2F05%2F14%2FMN44704.DTL&type=printable |archivedate = April 29, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe early hunt for the Unabomber portrayed a perpetrator far different from the eventual suspect.
