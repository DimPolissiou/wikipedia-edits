See also {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, (p. 327), which distinguishes between predictions (as deterministic) and forecasts (as probabilistic). Not all scientists distinguish \"prediction\" and \"forecast\", but it is useful, and will be observed in this article.</ref> Prediction can be further distinguished from [[earthquake warning system]]s, which upon detection of an earthquake, provide a real-time warning of seconds to neighboring regions that might be affected.\n\nIn the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1617}}; {{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a72.3, p. 427; {{Harvnb|Console|2001}}, p. 261<!-- {{Harvnb|Allen|1976}} -->.</ref>  Demonstrably successful predictions of large earthquakes have not occurred and the few claims of success are controversial.

See also [http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/earthquake/ ''Nature'' Debates].</ref>\n\n== Evaluating earthquake predictions ==\n\n{{See also|Prediction#Prediction in science}}\n\nPredictions are deemed significant if they can be shown to be successful beyond random chance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992}}, p. 32; {{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}, p. 302.</ref> Therefore, methods of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] are used to determine the probability that an earthquake such as is predicted would happen anyway (the [[null hypothesis]]). The predictions are then evaluated by testing whether they correlate with actual earthquakes better than the null hypothesis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Console|2001}}.</ref>\n\nIn many instances, however, the statistical nature of earthquake occurrence is not simply homogeneous. Clustering occurs in both space and time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|1996a}}, p. 3775.</ref> In southern California about 6% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are \"followed by an earthquake of larger magnitude within 5 days and 10 km.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1985|p=1669}}.</ref> In central Italy 9.5% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are followed by a larger event within 48 hours and 30&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Harvnb|Console|2001|p=1261}}.</ref> While such statistics are not satisfactory for purposes of prediction (giving ten to twenty false alarms for each successful prediction) they will skew the results of any analysis that assumes that earthquakes occur randomly in time, for example, as realized from a [[Poisson process]]. It has been shown that a \"naive\" method based solely on clustering can successfully predict about 5% of earthquakes; \"far better than 'chance'\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}. This was based on data from Southern California.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Alarm dilemma.png|frame|The Dilemma: To Alarm? or Not to Alarm?]]\nAs the purpose of short-term prediction is to enable emergency measures to reduce death and destruction, failure to give warning of a major earthquake, that does occur, or at least an adequate evaluation of the hazard, can result in legal liability, or even political purging. For example, it has been reported that members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were purged for \"having ignored scientific predictions of the disastrous Tangshan earthquake of summer 1976.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wade|1977}}.</ref> Following the L'Aquila earthquake of 2009, seven scientists and technicians in Italy were convicted of manslaughter, but not so much for failing to ''predict'' the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake#Prosecutions|2009 L'Aquila Earthquake]] (where some 300 people died) as for ''giving undue assurance'' to the populace \u2013 one victim called it \"anaesthetizing\" \u2013 that there would ''not'' be a serious earthquake, and therefore no need to take precautions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}; {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2011}}. Additional details in {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2012}}.</ref> But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost:  not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a75.2, p. 437.</ref> False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atwood|Major|1998}}.</ref> In  1999 it was reported<ref>{{Harvnb|Saegusa|1999}}.</ref> that China was introducing \"tough regulations intended to stamp out \u2018false\u2019 earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors.\" This was prompted by \"more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... in the past three years, none of which has been accurate.\" <ref>However, Mileti and Sorensen have argued that the extent of panic related to public disaster forecasts, and the 'cry wolf' problem with respect to repeated false alarms, have both been overestimated, and can be mitigated through appropriate communications from the authorities. {{Harvnb|Mileti|Sorensen|1990}}.</ref> The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes.  The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any prediction method.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2003|p=48}} and through out.</ref>\n\nIn a 1997 study<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997}}.</ref> of the cost-benefit ratio of earthquake prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent prediction method would be of questionable social utility, because \"organized evacuation of urban centers is unlikely to be successfully accomplished\", while \"panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated.\" He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece's entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=483}}.</ref>\n\n== Prediction methods ==\n\nEarthquake prediction is an immature science\u2014it has not yet led to a successful prediction of an earthquake from first physical principles. Research into methods of prediction therefore focus on empirical analysis, with two general approaches: either identifying distinctive ''precursors'' to earthquakes, or identifying some kind of geophysical ''trend'' or pattern in seismicity that might precede a large earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|PEP|1976|p=9}}.</ref> Precursor methods are pursued largely because of their potential utility for short-term earthquake prediction or forecasting, while 'trend' methods are generally thought to be useful for forecasting, long term prediction (10 to 100 years time scale) or intermediate term prediction (1 to 10 years time scale).<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Nagao|Kamogawa|2009|p=205}}; {{Harvnb|Hayakawa|2015}}.</ref>\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nAn earthquake precursor is an anomalous phenomenon that might give effective warning of an impending earthquake.<ref>The IASPEI Sub-Commission for Earthquake Prediction defined a precursor as \"a quantitatively measurable change in an environmental parameter that occurs before mainshocks, and that is thought to be linked to the preparation process for this mainshock.\" {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc=\u00a73.1}}</ref> Reports of these \u2013 though generally recognized as such only after the event \u2013 number in the thousands,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997|p=429}}, \u00a73.</ref> some dating back to antiquity.<ref>E.g., [[Claudius Aelianus]], in ''De natura animalium, book 11'', commenting on the destruction of [[Helike]] in 373 BC, but writing five centuries later.</ref> There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rikitake|1979|p=294}}. {{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009}} has a more recent compilation</ref> running the gamut from [[aeronomy]] to zoology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|2004|p=335}}.</ref> None have been found to be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=425}}. See also: {{Harvtxt|Jackson|2004|p=348}}: \"The search for precursors has a checkered history, with no convincing successes.\" {{Harvtxt|Zechar|Jordan|2008|p=723}}: \"The consistent failure to find reliable earthquake precursors...\". {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2009}}: \"... no convincing evidence of diagnostic precursors.\"</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990, the IASPEI solicited nominations for a Preliminary List of Significant Precursors. Forty nominations were made, of which five were selected as possible significant precursors, with two of those based on a single observation each.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|Booth|1997|p=424}}.</ref>\n\nAfter a critical review of the scientific literature the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF) concluded in 2011 there was \"considerable room for methodological improvements in this type of research.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=338}}.</ref> In particular, many cases of reported precursors are contradictory, lack a measure of amplitude, or are generally unsuitable for a rigorous statistical evaluation. Published results are biased towards positive results, and so the rate of false negatives (earthquake but no precursory signal) is unclear.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=361}}.</ref>\n\n==== Animal behavior ====\n\nFor centuries there have been anecdotal accounts of anomalous animal behavior preceding and associated with earthquakes. In cases where animals display unusual behavior some tens of seconds prior to a quake, it has been suggested they are responding to the [[P-wave]].<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}; {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=1204}}.</ref> These travel through the ground about twice as fast as the [[S-wave]]s that cause most severe shaking.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref> They predict not the earthquake itself \u2014 that has already happened \u2014 but only the imminent arrival of the more destructive S-waves.\n\nIt has also been suggested that unusual behavior hours or even days beforehand could be triggered by foreshock activity at magnitudes that most people do not notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=}}.</ref> Another confounding factor of accounts of unusual phenomena is skewing due to \"[[flashbulb memories]]\": otherwise unremarkable details become more memorable and more significant when associated with an emotionally powerful event such as an earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Kulik|1977}}.</ref> A study that attempted to control for these kinds of factors found an increase in unusual animal behavior (possibly triggered by foreshocks) in one case, but not in four other cases of seemingly similar earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981}}.  In an earlier study similar behavior was seen before storms. {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Verosub|Howell|1979|p=687}}.</ref>\n\n==== Dilatancy\u2013diffusion ====\nIn the 1970s the dilatancy\u2013diffusion hypothesis was highly regarded as providing a physical basis for various phenomena seen as possible earthquake precursors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> It was based on \"solid and repeatable evidence\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=217}}.</ref> from laboratory experiments that highly stressed crystalline rock experienced a change in volume, or ''dilatancy'',<ref>Subsequent ''diffusion'' of water back into the affected volume of rock is what leads to failure.  {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref> which causes changes in other characteristics, such as seismic velocity and electrical resistivity, and even large-scale uplifts of topography.  It was believed this happened in a 'preparatory phase' just prior to the earthquake, and that suitable monitoring could therefore warn of an impending quake.\n\nDetection of variations in the relative velocities of the primary and secondary seismic waves \u2013 expressed as Vp/Vs \u2013 as they passed through a certain zone was the basis for predicting the 1973 Blue Mountain Lake (NY) and 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> Although these predictions were informal and even trivial, their apparent success was seen as confirmation of both dilatancy and the existence of a preparatory process, leading to what were subsequently called \"wildly over-optimistic statements\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> that successful earthquake prediction \"appears to be on the verge of practical reality.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}, quoted by {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, many studies questioned these results,<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=333\u2013334}}; see also {{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}} and {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> and the hypothesis eventually languished. Subsequent study showed it \"failed for several reasons, largely associated with the validity of the assumptions on which it was based\", including the assumption that laboratory results can be scaled up to the real world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=226}}.</ref> Another factor was the bias of retrospective selection of criteria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|pp=220\u2013221, 226}}; see also {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> Other studies have shown dilatancy to be so negligible that {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012}} concluded: \"The concept of a large-scale 'preparation zone' indicating the likely magnitude of a future event, remains as ethereal as the ether that went undetected in the [[Michelson\u2013Morley]] experiment.\"\n\n==== Changes in V<sub>p</sub>/V<sub>s</sub> ====\n\n''V''<sub>p</sub> is the symbol for the velocity of a seismic \"P\" (primary or pressure) wave passing through rock, while ''V''<sub>s</sub> is the symbol for the velocity of the \"S\" (secondary or shear) wave.  Small-scale laboratory experiments have shown that the ratio of these two velocities \u2013 represented as ''V''<sub>p</sub>/''V''<sub>s</sub> \u2013 changes when rock is near the point of fracturing.  In the 1970s it was considered a likely breakthrough when Russian seismologists reported observing such changes (later discounted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=}}.</ref>) in the region of a subsequent earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}. Additional references in {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc= \u00a72.4}}.</ref> This effect, as well as other possible precursors, has been attributed to dilatancy, where rock stressed to near its breaking point expands (dilates) slightly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}.</ref>\n\nStudy of this phenomenon near [[Blue Mountain Lake (New York)|Blue Mountain Lake]] in [[New York State]] led to a successful albeit informal prediction in 1973,<ref>{{Harvnb|Aggarwal|Sykes|Simpson|Richards|1975}}.</ref> and it was credited for predicting the 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> However, additional successes have not followed, and it has been suggested that these predictions were a flukes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=110}}.</ref> A ''V''<sub>p</sub>/''V''<sub>s</sub> anomaly was the basis of a 1976 prediction of a M 5.5 to 6.5 earthquake near Los Angeles, which failed to occur.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1983|p=79}}; {{Harvnb|Whitcomb|1977}}.</ref> Other studies relying on quarry blasts (more precise, and repeatable) found no such variations,<ref>{{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}}.</ref> while an analysis of two earthquakes in California found that the variations reported were more likely caused by other factors, including retrospective selection of data.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> {{Harvtxt|Geller|1997}} noted that reports of significant velocity changes have ceased since about 1980.\n\n==== Radon emissions ====\n\nMost rock contains small amounts of gases that can be isotopically distinguished from the normal atmospheric gases.  There are reports of spikes in the concentrations of such gases prior to a major earthquake; this has been attributed to release due to pre-seismic stress or fracturing of the rock.  One of these gases is [[radon]], produced by radioactive decay of the trace amounts of uranium present in most rock.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=333}}</ref>\n\nRadon is useful as a potential earthquake predictor because it is radioactive and thus easily detected,<ref>Giampaolo Giuiliani's claimed prediction of the [[#L'Aquila|L'Aquila]] earthquake was based on monitoring of radon levels.</ref> and its short [[half-life]] (3.8 days) makes radon levels sensitive to short-term fluctuations.  A 2009 review<ref>{{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009|p=382}}.</ref> found 125 reports of changes in radon emissions prior to 86 earthquakes since 1966. But as the ICEF found in its review, the earthquakes with which these changes are supposedly linked were up to a thousand kilometers away, months later, and at all magnitudes.  In some cases the anomalies were observed at a distant site, but not at closer sites.  The ICEF found \"no significant correlation\".<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=334}}. See also {{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pp=93\u201395}}.</ref> Another review concluded that in some cases changes in radon levels preceded an earthquake, but a correlation is not yet firmly established.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\n==== Electromagnetic anomalies ====\nObservations of electromagnetic disturbances and their attribution to the earthquake failure process go back as far as the [[Great Lisbon earthquake]] of 1755, but practically all such observations prior to the mid-1960s are invalid because the instruments used were sensitive to physical movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|2002|p=621}}.</ref> Since then various anomalous electrical, electric-resistive, and magnetic phenomena have been attributed to precursory stress and strain changes that precede earthquakes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Park|1996|p=493}}.</ref> raising hopes for finding a reliable earthquake precursor.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Geller|1996a}} and {{Harvnb|Geller|1996b}} for some history of these hopes.</ref> While a handful of researchers have gained much attention with either theories of how such phenomena might be generated, claims of having observed such phenomena prior to an earthquake, no such phenomena has been shown to be an actual precursor.\n\nA 2011 review by the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF)<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=335}}.</ref> found the \"most convincing\" electromagnetic precursors to be ULF magnetic anomalies, such as the Corralitos event (discussed below) recorded before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. However, it is now believed that observation was a system malfunction. Study of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precursory electromagnetic signals of any type; further study showed that earthquakes with magnitudes less than 5 do not produce significant transient signals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Park|Dalrymple|Larsen|2007|loc=paragraphs 1 and 32}}.

For example the VAN \"IOA\" station was next to an antenna park, and the station at Pirgos, where most of the 1980s predictions were derived, was found to lie over the buried grounding grid of a military radio transmitter. VAN has not distinguished their \"seismic electric signals\" from artificial electromagnetic noise or from radio-telecommunication and industrial sources. {{Harvnb|Chouliaras|Stavrakakis|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Le Mou\u00ebl|1998|pp=2025, 2028}}; {{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Le Mou\u00ebl|Chouliaras|1999}}.</ref> Further work in Greece has tracked SES-like \"anomalous transient electric signals\" back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pham|Boyer|Chouliaras|Savvaidis|2002}}.</ref>\n\nThe validity of the VAN method, and therefore the predictive significance of SES, was based primarily on the empirical claim of demonstrated predictive success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=481}}.</ref> Numerous weaknesses have been uncovered in the VAN methodology,<ref>For example it has been shown that the VAN predictions are more likely to follow an earthquake than to precede one. It seems that where there have been recent shocks the VAN personnel are more likely to interpret the usual electrical variations as SES. The tendency for earthquakes to cluster then accounts for an increased chance of an earthquake in the rather broad prediction window. Other aspects of this will be discussed below.</ref> and in 2011 the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection concluded that the prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=335\u2013336}}.</ref> Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \"resoundingly debunked\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=195}}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \"natural time\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction.

Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54&nbsp;km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser-Smith|Bernardi|McGill|Ladd|1990| p=1467}} called it \"encouraging\".</ref>\n\nAdditional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed.  More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|2009}}</ref> or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Love|Johnston|2009}}</ref>\n\n===== Freund physics =====\n\nIn his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2000}}</ref> The study of such currents and interactions is known as \"Freund physics\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=133\u2013135}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Heraud|Centa|Bleier|2015}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Enriquez|2015}}</ref>\n\nMost seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=137\u2013139}}</ref>\n\n====== Disturbance of the daily cycle of the ionosphere ======\n[[File:LAQUILA 2009 ULF.JPG|thumb|The ULF* recording of the D layer retention of the ionosphere which absorbs EM radiation during the nights before the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on 6/4/2009]]. The anomaly is indicated in red.]]\nThe [[ionosphere]] usually develops its lower [[Ionosphere#D layer|D layer]] during the day, while at night this layer disappears as the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] there turns to [[gas]]. During the night, the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]] of the ionosphere remains formed, in higher altitude than D layer. A [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|waveguide]] for low [[High frequency|HF]] radio frequencies up to 10&nbsp;MHz is formed during the night ([[skywave]] propagation) as the F layer reflects these waves back to the Earth.

In this article the term ULF is listed as ULF*.</ref> of the daily cycle of the ionosphere indicate that the usual cycle could be disturbed a few days before a shallow strong earthquake. When the disturbance occurs, it is observed that either the D layer is lost during the day resulting to ionosphere elevation and skywave formation or the D layer appears at night resulting to lower of the ionosphere and hence absence of skywave.<ref>{{harvnb|Eftaxias|Athanasopoulou|Balasis|Kalimeri|2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Eftaxias|Balasis|Contoyiannis|Papadimitriou|2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tsolis|Xenos|2010}}</ref>\n\nScience centers have developed a network of VLF transmitters and receivers on a global scale that detect changes in skywave.

In the next recording, 2 days after the earthquake, the thermal anomaly has disappeared.]]\nOne way of detecting the mobility of tectonic stresses is to detect locally elevated [[temperature]]s on the surface of the crust measured by [[satellite]]s. During the evaluation process, the background of daily variation and [[noise]] due to atmospheric disturbances and human activities are removed before visualizing the concentration of trends in the wider area of a fault.  This method has been experimentally applied since 1995.<ref>{{Harvnb|Filizzola|Pergola|Pietrapertosa|Tramutoli|2004}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lisi|Filizzola|Genzano|Grimaldi|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Pergola|Aliano|Coviello|Filizzola|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Genzano|Aliano|Corrado|Filizzola|2009}}</ref>\n\nIn a newer approach to explain the phenomenon, [[NASA]]'s Friedmann Freund has proposed that the [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] captured by the satellites is not due to a real increase in the surface temperature of the crust. According to this version the emission is a result of the [[Quantum excitation (accelerator physics)|quantum excitation]] that occurs at the chemical re-bonding of [[Electric charge|positive charge]] carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]) which are traveling from the deepest layers to the surface of the crust at a speed of 200 meters per second. The electric charge arises as a result of increasing tectonic stresses as the time of the earthquake approaches. This emission extends superficially up to 500 x 500 square kilometers for very large events and stops almost immediately after the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Trends ===\n\nInstead of watching for anomalous phenomena that might be precursory signs of an impending earthquake, other approaches to predicting earthquakes look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches also tend to be more probabilistic, and to have larger time periods, and so merge into earthquake forecasting.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=for 'more probabilistic', for 'larger periods' and for 'earthquake forecasting' adaptation better than earthquake prediction}}\n\n==== Elastic rebound ====\n\nEven the stiffest of rock is not perfectly rigid.  Given a large force (such as between two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the earth's crust will bend or deform. According to the [[elastic rebound]] theory of {{Harvtxt|Reid|1910}}, eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault.  Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|1910|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=329}}.</ref> The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in elastic deformation and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake),<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|Coppersmith|1994|loc=Fig.  11, p. 993}}.</ref> the demonstrated existence of large [[strike-slip]] displacements of hundreds of miles shows the existence of a long running earthquake cycle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zoback|2006}} provides a clear explanation.  {{Harvnb|Evans|1997|loc=\u00a72.2}} also provides a description of the \"self-organized criticality\" (SOC) paradigm that is displacing the elastic rebound model.</ref>\n\n==== Characteristic earthquakes ====\n\nThe most studied earthquake faults (such as the [[Nankai megathrust]], the [[Wasatch fault]], and the [[San Andreas fault]]) appear to have distinct segments.  The ''characteristic earthquake'' model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments.<ref>{{harvnb|Castellaro|2003}}</ref> As the lengths and other properties<ref>These include the type of rock and fault geometry.</ref> of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which is limited by the length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment.  Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2|p=93}}.</ref> For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely [[return period]]) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. [[UCERF3]] is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California.<ref>{{Harvnb|UCERF|2008}}.</ref> Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.\n\nThe idea of characteristic earthquakes was the basis of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]]: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, with a standard deviation of \u00b13.1 years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=619}}. Of course these were not the only earthquakes in this period. The attentive reader will recall that, in seismically active areas, earthquakes of some magnitude happen fairly constantly.  The \"Parkfield earthquakes\" are either the ones noted in the historical record, or were selected from the instrumental record on the basis of location and magnitude.  {{Harvtxt|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S399}} and {{Harvtxt|Kagan|1997|pp=211\u2013212, 213}} argue that the selection parameters can bias the statistics, and that sequences of four or six quakes, with different recurrence intervals, are also plausible.</ref> Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=621}}.</ref> The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the ''trend'', which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters.  However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S408}} say the claim of quasi-periodicity is \"baseless\".</ref>\n\nThe failure of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]] has raised doubt as to the validity of the characteristic earthquake model itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}.</ref> Some studies have questioned the various assumptions, including the key one that earthquakes are constrained within segments, and suggested that the \"characteristic earthquakes\" may be an artifact of selection bias and the shortness of seismological records (relative to earthquake cycles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,420}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Friedrich|Newman|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2}}, and references there; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|Geller|2012}}. See also the Nature debates.</ref> Other studies have considered whether other factors need to be considered, such as the age of the fault.<ref>Young faults are expected to have complex, irregular surfaces, which impede slippage. In time these rough spots are ground off, changing the mechanical characteristics of the fault.  {{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004|p=185}}.</ref> Whether earthquake ruptures are more generally constrained within a segment (as is often seen), or break past segment boundaries (also seen), has a direct bearing on the degree of earthquake hazard: earthquakes are larger where multiple segments break, but in relieving more strain they will happen less often.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Seismic gaps ====\n\nAt the contact where two tectonic plates slip past each other every section must eventually slip, as (in the long-term) none get left behind.  But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the seismic gap model the \"next big quake\" should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|2002|loc=\u00a75.3.3|p=284}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S404}}.</ref> This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was the basis of a series of circum-Pacific ([[Pacific Rim]]) forecasts in 1979 and 1989\u20131991.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|McCann|Nishenko|Sykes|Krause|1979}}; {{Harvnb|Rong|Jackson|Kagan|2003}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, some underlying assumptions about seismic gaps are now known to be incorrect.

Probably the most widely known is the M8 family of algorithms (including the RTP method) developed under the leadership of [[Vladimir Keilis-Borok]].  M8 issues a \"Time of Increased Probability\" (TIP) alarm for a large earthquake of a specified magnitude upon observing certain patterns of smaller earthquakes. TIPs generally cover large areas (up to a thousand kilometers across) for up to five years.<ref>See details in {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.4}}.</ref> Such large parameters have made M8 controversial, as it is hard to determine whether any hits that happened were skillfully predicted, or only the result of chance.\n\nM8 gained considerable attention when the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes occurred within a TIP.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref>  In 1999, Keilis-Borok's group published a claim to have achieved statistically significant intermediate-term results using their M8 and MSc models, as far as world-wide large earthquakes are regarded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kossobokov|first=V.G.|last2=Romashkova|first2=L.L.|last3=Keilis-Borok|first3=V.

(2019)\u00a0 reported having successfully trained a regression [[random forest]] on acoustic time series data capable of identifying a signal emitted from fault zones that forecasts fault failure. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) suggested that the identified signal, previously assumed to be statistical noise, reflects the increasing emission of energy before its sudden release during a slip event. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) further postulated that their approach could bound fault failure times and lead to the identification of other unknown signals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rouet-Leduc|first=Bertrand|last2=Hulbert|first2=Claudia|last3=Lubbers|first3=Nicholas|last4=Barros|first4=Kipton|last5=Humphreys|first5=Colin|last6=Johnson|first6=Paul A.|date=2017-09-28|title=Machine Learning Predicts Laboratory Earthquakes|arxiv=1702.05774|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=44|issue=18|pages=9276\u20139282|doi=10.1002/2017GL074677}}</ref> Due to the rarity of the most catastrophic earthquakes, acquiring representative data remains problematic. In response, Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) have conjectured that their model would not need to train on data from catastrophic earthquakes, since further research has shown the seismic patterns of interest to be similar in smaller earthquakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-takes-on-earthquake-prediction-20190919/|title=Artificial Intelligence Takes On Earthquake Prediction|last=Smart|first=Ashley|website=Quanta Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nDeep learning has also been applied to earthquake prediction. Although [[Bath's Law|Bath\u2019s law]] and [[Omori's law|Omori\u2019s law]] describe the magnitude of earthquake aftershocks and their time-varying properties, the prediction of the \u201cspatial distribution of aftershocks\u201d remains an open research problem. Using the [[Theano (software)|Theano]] and [[TensorFlow]] software libraries, DeVries et al. (2018) trained a [[neural network]] that achieved higher accuracy in the prediction of spatial distributions of earthquake aftershocks than the previously established methodology of Coulomb failure stress change. Notably, DeVries et al. (2018) reported that their model made no \u201cassumptions about receiver plane orientation or geometry\u201d and heavily weighted the change in shear stress, \u201csum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor,\u201d and the von Mises yield criterion. DeVries et al. (2018) postulated that the reliance of their model on these physical quantities indicated that they might \u201ccontrol earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.\u201d For validation testing, DeVries et al. (2018) reserved 10% of positive training earthquake data samples and an equal quantity of randomly chosen negative samples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeVries|first=Phoebe M.

Additionally, Shah noted that simpler neural networks than the 6 layer model devised by DeVries et al. (2018) could have achieved similar performance. When prompted by Shah to address these criticisms, Nature declined to modify Devries et al.

An area he mentioned frequently was the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone]] at the southeast corner of the state of [[Missouri]], the site of three very large earthquakes in 1811\u201312, which he coupled with the date of 3 December 1990.\n\nBrowning's reputation and perceived credibility were boosted when he claimed in various promotional flyers and advertisements to have predicted (among various other events<ref>Including \"a 50/50 probability that the federal government of the U.S. will fall in 1992.\" {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p= 39 [47]}}.</ref>) the Loma Prieta earthquake of 17 October 1989.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|pp=9\u201311 [17\u201319 (pdf)]}}, and see various documents in Appendix A, including ''The Browning Newsletter'' for 21 November 1989 (p. 26 [34]).</ref> The National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (NEPEC) formed an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) to evaluate Browning's prediction. Its report (issued 18 October 1990) specifically rejected the claim of a successful prediction of the Loma Prieta earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|AHWG|1990|p=iii [55]}}. Included in {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993}} as part of Appendix B, pp. 45\u201366 [53\u201375].</ref> A transcript of his talk in San Francisco on 10 October showed he had said: \"there will probably be several earthquakes around the world, Richter 6+, and there may be a volcano or two\" \u2013 which, on a global scale, is about average for a week \u2013 with no mention of any earthquake in California.<ref>{{Harvnb|AHWG|1990|p=30 [72]}}.</ref>\n\nThough the AHWG report disproved both Browning's claims of prior success and the basis of his \"projection\", it made little impact after a year of continued claims of a successful prediction. Browning's prediction received the support of geophysicist David Stewart,<ref>Previously involved in a psychic prediction of an earthquake for North Carolina in 1975 {{Harv|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p=13 [21]}}, Stewart sent a 13 page memo to a number of colleagues extolling Browning's supposed accomplishments, including predicting Loma Prieta.  {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p=29 [37]}}</ref> and the tacit endorsement of many public authorities in their preparations for a major disaster, all of which was amplified by massive exposure in the news media.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993}} throughout.</ref> Nothing happened on 3 December,<ref>{{Harvnb|Tierney|1993|p=11}}.</ref> and Browning died of a heart attack seven months later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spence|Herrmann|Johnston|Reagor|1993|p=40 [48]}} (p. 4 [12]).</ref>\n\n=== 2004 & 2005: Southern California, U.S. (Keilis-Borok) ===\n{{anchor|Southern California}}\n\nThe [[#M8|M8]] algorithm (developed under the leadership of [[Vladimir Keilis-Borok]] at [[UCLA]]) gained respect by the apparently successful predictions of the 2003 San Simeon and Hokkaido earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}; {{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pp=145\u2013146}}.</ref> Great interest was therefore generated by the prediction in early 2004 of a M \u2265 6.4 earthquake to occur somewhere within an area of southern California of approximately 12,000 sq. miles, on or before 5 September 2004.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref> In evaluating this prediction the [[California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council]] (CEPEC) noted that this method had not yet made enough predictions for statistical validation, and was sensitive to input assumptions. It therefore concluded that no \"special public policy actions\" were warranted, though it reminded all Californians \"of the significant seismic hazards throughout the state.\"<ref>{{harvnb|CEPEC|2004a}}.</ref> The predicted earthquake did not occur.\n\nA very similar prediction was made for an earthquake on or before 14 August 2005, in approximately the same area of southern California.  The CEPEC's evaluation and recommendation were essentially the same, this time noting that the previous prediction and two others had not been fulfilled.<ref>{{Harvnb|CEPEC|2004b}}.</ref> This prediction also failed.\n\n=== 2009: L'Aquila, Italy (Giuliani) ===\n{{main|2009 L'Aquila earthquake}}\n\nAt 03:32 on 6 April 2009, the [[Abruzzo]] region of central Italy was rocked by a magnitude M 6.3 earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, p. 320.</ref> In the city of [[L'Aquila]] and surrounding area around 60,000 buildings collapsed or were seriously damaged, resulting in 308 deaths and 67,500 people left homeless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alexander|2010}}, p. 326.</ref> Around the same time, it was reported that Giampaolo Giuliani had predicted the earthquake, had tried to warn the public, but had been muzzled by the Italian government.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Telegraph, 6 April|2009}}. See also {{Harvnb|McIntyre|2009}}.</ref>\n\nGiampaolo Giuliani was a laboratory technician at the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]]. As a hobby he had for some years been monitoring radon using instruments he had designed and built. Prior to the L'Aquila earthquake he was unknown to the scientific community, and had not published any scientific work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}, p. 267.</ref> He had been interviewed on 24 March by an Italian-language blog, ''Donne Democratiche'', about a swarm of low-level earthquakes in the Abruzzo region that had started the previous December.  He said that this swarm was normal and would diminish by the end of March.  On 30 March, L'Aquila was struck by a magnitude 4.0 temblor, the largest to date.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}.</ref>\n\nOn 27 March Giuliani warned the mayor of L'Aquila there could be an earthquake within 24 hours, and an earthquake M~2.3 occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Guardian, 5 April|2010}}.</ref> On 29 March he made a second prediction.<ref>The {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2011|p=323}} alludes to predictions made on 17 February and 10 March.</ref> He telephoned the mayor of the town of Sulmona, about 55 kilometers southeast of L'Aquila, to expect a \"damaging\" \u2013 or even \"catastrophic\" \u2013 earthquake within 6 to 24 hours. Loudspeaker vans were used to warn the inhabitants of Sulmona to evacuate, with consequential panic. No quake ensued and Giuliano was cited for inciting public alarm and enjoined from making future public predictions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}, p. 267; {{Harvnb|Alexander|2010}}, p. 330.</ref>\n\nAfter the L'Aquila event Giuliani claimed that he had found alarming rises in radon levels just hours before.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}; {{Harvnb|The Telegraph, 6 April|2009}}.</ref> He said he had warned relatives, friends and colleagues on the evening before the earthquake hit.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Guardian, 5 April|2010}}; {{Harvnb|Kerr|2009}}.</ref> He was subsequently interviewed by the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection, which found that Giuliani had not transmitted a valid prediction of the mainshock to the civil authorities before its occurrence.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, p. 323, and see also p. 335.</ref>\n\n== Difficulty or impossibility ==\n\nAs the preceding examples show, the record of earthquake prediction has been disappointing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997}} found \"no obvious successes\".</ref> The optimism of the 1970s that routine prediction of earthquakes would be \"soon\", perhaps within ten years,<ref>{{Harvnb|PEP|1976|p=2}}.</ref> was coming up disappointingly short by the 1990s,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kagan|1997b|p=505}} said: \"The results of efforts to develop earthquake prediction methods over the last 30 years have been disappointing: after many monographs and conferences and thousands of papers we are no closer to a working forecast than we were in the 1960s\".</ref> and many scientists began wondering why.  By 1997 it was being positively stated that earthquakes can ''not'' be predicted,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller |Jackson |Kagan|Mulargia |1997}}.</ref> which led to a notable debate in 1999 on whether prediction of individual earthquakes is a realistic scientific goal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|1999}}, \"''Nature'' debates\".</ref>\n\nEarthquake prediction may have failed only because it is \"fiendishly difficult\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1617}}.</ref> and still beyond the current competency of science.  Despite the confident announcement four decades ago that seismology was \"on the verge\" of making reliable predictions,<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}.</ref> there may yet be an underestimation of the difficulties.  As early as 1978 it was reported that earthquake rupture might be complicated by \"heterogeneous distribution of mechanical properties along the fault\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Kanamori|Stewart|1978|loc=abstract}}.</ref> and in 1986 that geometrical irregularities in the fault surface \"appear to exert major controls on the starting and stopping of ruptures\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Sibson|1986}}.</ref> Another study attributed significant differences in fault behavior to the maturity of the fault.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}.  More mature faults presumably slip more readily because they have been ground smoother and flatter.</ref> These kinds of complexities are not reflected in current prediction methods.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984|pp=5696\u20137}} argued that the characteristics of fault rupture on a given fault \"can be considered essentially constant through several seismic cycles\".  The expectation of a regular rate of occurrence that accounts for all other factors was rather disappointed by the lateness of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield earthquake]].</ref>\n\nSeismology may even yet lack an adequate grasp of its most central concept, [[#Elastic rebound|elastic rebound theory]].  A simulation that explored assumptions regarding the distribution of slip found results \"not in agreement with the classical view of the elastic rebound theory\". (This was attributed to details of fault heterogeneity not accounted for in the theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ziv|Cochard|Schmittbuhl|2007}}.</ref>)\n\nEarthquake prediction may be intrinsically impossible.  It has been argued that the Earth is in a state of [[self-organized criticality]] \"where any small earthquake has some probability of cascading into a large event\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1616}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|1997b|p=517}}. See also {{Harvnb|Kagan|1997b|p=520}}, {{Harvnb|Vidale|1996}} and especially {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc= \u00a79.1, \"Chaos, SOC, and predictability\"}}.</ref> It has also been argued on decision-theoretic grounds that \"prediction of major earthquakes is, in any practical sense, impossible.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Matthews|1997}}.</ref>\n\nThat earthquake prediction might be intrinsically impossible has been strongly disputed<ref>E.g., {{Harvnb|Sykes|Shaw|Scholz|1999}} and {{Harvnb|Evison|1999}}.</ref> But the best disproof of impossibility \u2013 effective earthquake prediction \u2013 has yet to be demonstrated.<ref>\"Despite over a century of scientific effort, the understanding of earthquake predictability remains immature.

See also {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011}}, (p. 327), which distinguishes between predictions (as deterministic) and forecasts (as probabilistic). Not all scientists distinguish \"prediction\" and \"forecast\", but it is useful, and will be observed in this article.</ref> Prediction can be further distinguished from [[earthquake warning system]]s, which upon detection of an earthquake, provide a real-time warning of seconds to neighboring regions that might be affected.\n\nIn the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|Jackson|Kagan|Mulargia|1997|p=1617}}; {{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a72.3, p. 427; {{Harvnb|Console|2001}}, p. 261<!-- {{Harvnb|Allen|1976}} -->.</ref>  Demonstrably successful predictions of large earthquakes have not occurred and the few claims of success are controversial.

See also [http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/earthquake/ ''Nature'' Debates].</ref>\n\n== Evaluating earthquake predictions ==\n\n{{See also|Prediction#Prediction in science}}\n\nPredictions are deemed significant if they can be shown to be successful beyond random chance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992}}, p. 32; {{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}, p. 302.</ref> Therefore, methods of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] are used to determine the probability that an earthquake such as is predicted would happen anyway (the [[null hypothesis]]). The predictions are then evaluated by testing whether they correlate with actual earthquakes better than the null hypothesis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Console|2001}}.</ref>\n\nIn many instances, however, the statistical nature of earthquake occurrence is not simply homogeneous. Clustering occurs in both space and time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|1996a}}, p. 3775.</ref> In southern California about 6% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are \"followed by an earthquake of larger magnitude within 5 days and 10 km.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|1985|p=1669}}.</ref> In central Italy 9.5% of M\u22653.0 earthquakes are followed by a larger event within 48 hours and 30&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Harvnb|Console|2001|p=1261}}.</ref> While such statistics are not satisfactory for purposes of prediction (giving ten to twenty false alarms for each successful prediction) they will skew the results of any analysis that assumes that earthquakes occur randomly in time, for example, as realized from a [[Poisson process]]. It has been shown that a \"naive\" method based solely on clustering can successfully predict about 5% of earthquakes; \"far better than 'chance'\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Luen|Stark|2008}}. This was based on data from Southern California.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Alarm dilemma.png|frame|The Dilemma: To Alarm? or Not to Alarm?]]\nAs the purpose of short-term prediction is to enable emergency measures to reduce death and destruction, failure to give warning of a major earthquake, that does occur, or at least an adequate evaluation of the hazard, can result in legal liability, or even political purging. For example, it has been reported that members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were purged for \"having ignored scientific predictions of the disastrous Tangshan earthquake of summer 1976.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wade|1977}}.</ref> Following the L'Aquila earthquake of 2009, seven scientists and technicians in Italy were convicted of manslaughter, but not so much for failing to ''predict'' the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake#Prosecutions|2009 L'Aquila Earthquake]] (where some 300 people died) as for ''giving undue assurance'' to the populace \u2013 one victim called it \"anaesthetizing\" \u2013 that there would ''not'' be a serious earthquake, and therefore no need to take precautions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|2011}}; {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2011}}. Additional details in {{Harvnb|Cartlidge|2012}}.</ref> But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost:  not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997}}, \u00a75.2, p. 437.</ref> False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atwood|Major|1998}}.</ref> In  1999 it was reported<ref>{{Harvnb|Saegusa|1999}}.</ref> that China was introducing \"tough regulations intended to stamp out \u2018false\u2019 earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors.\" This was prompted by \"more than 30 unofficial earthquake warnings ... in the past three years, none of which has been accurate.\" <ref>However, Mileti and Sorensen have argued that the extent of panic related to public disaster forecasts, and the 'cry wolf' problem with respect to repeated false alarms, have both been overestimated, and can be mitigated through appropriate communications from the authorities. {{Harvnb|Mileti|Sorensen|1990}}.</ref> The acceptable trade-off between missed quakes and false alarms depends on the societal valuation of these outcomes.  The rate of occurrence of both must be considered when evaluating any prediction method.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2003|p=48}} and through out.</ref>\n\nIn a 1997 study<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997}}.</ref> of the cost-benefit ratio of earthquake prediction research in Greece, Stathis Stiros suggested that even a (hypothetical) excellent prediction method would be of questionable social utility, because \"organized evacuation of urban centers is unlikely to be successfully accomplished\", while \"panic and other undesirable side-effects can also be anticipated.\" He found that earthquakes kill less than ten people per year in Greece (on average), and that most of those fatalities occurred in large buildings with identifiable structural issues. Therefore, Stiros stated that it would be much more cost-effective to focus efforts on identifying and upgrading unsafe buildings. Since the death toll on Greek highways is more than 2300 per year on average, he argued that more lives would also be saved if Greece's entire budget for earthquake prediction had been used for street and highway safety instead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stiros|1997|p=483}}.</ref>\n\n== Prediction methods ==\n\nEarthquake prediction is an immature science\u2014it has not yet led to a successful prediction of an earthquake from first physical principles. Research into methods of prediction therefore focus on empirical analysis, with two general approaches: either identifying distinctive ''precursors'' to earthquakes, or identifying some kind of geophysical ''trend'' or pattern in seismicity that might precede a large earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|PEP|1976|p=9}}.</ref> Precursor methods are pursued largely because of their potential utility for short-term earthquake prediction or forecasting, while 'trend' methods are generally thought to be useful for forecasting, long term prediction (10 to 100 years time scale) or intermediate term prediction (1 to 10 years time scale).<ref>{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Nagao|Kamogawa|2009|p=205}}; {{Harvnb|Hayakawa|2015}}.</ref>\n\n=== Precursors ===\n\nAn earthquake precursor is an anomalous phenomenon that might give effective warning of an impending earthquake.<ref>The IASPEI Sub-Commission for Earthquake Prediction defined a precursor as \"a quantitatively measurable change in an environmental parameter that occurs before mainshocks, and that is thought to be linked to the preparation process for this mainshock.\" {{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc=\u00a73.1}}</ref> Reports of these \u2013 though generally recognized as such only after the event \u2013 number in the thousands,<ref>{{Harvnb|Geller|1997|p=429}}, \u00a73.</ref> some dating back to antiquity.<ref>E.g., [[Claudius Aelianus]], in ''De natura animalium, book 11'', commenting on the destruction of [[Helike]] in 373 BC, but writing five centuries later.</ref> There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rikitake|1979|p=294}}. {{Harvnb|Cicerone|Ebel|Britton|2009}} has a more recent compilation</ref> running the gamut from [[aeronomy]] to zoology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|2004|p=335}}.</ref> None have been found to be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Geller|1997|p=425}}. See also: {{Harvtxt|Jackson|2004|p=348}}: \"The search for precursors has a checkered history, with no convincing successes.\" {{Harvtxt|Zechar|Jordan|2008|p=723}}: \"The consistent failure to find reliable earthquake precursors...\". {{Harvtxt|ICEF|2009}}: \"... no convincing evidence of diagnostic precursors.\"</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990, the IASPEI solicited nominations for a Preliminary List of Significant Precursors. Forty nominations were made, of which five were selected as possible significant precursors, with two of those based on a single observation each.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyss|Booth|1997|p=424}}.</ref>\n\nAfter a critical review of the scientific literature the ''International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection'' (ICEF) concluded in 2011 there was \"considerable room for methodological improvements in this type of research.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=338}}.</ref> In particular, many cases of reported precursors are contradictory, lack a measure of amplitude, or are generally unsuitable for a rigorous statistical evaluation. Published results are biased towards positive results, and so the rate of false negatives (earthquake but no precursory signal) is unclear.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=361}}.</ref>\n\n==== Animal behavior ====\n\nFor centuries there have been anecdotal accounts of anomalous animal behavior preceding and associated with earthquakes. In cases where animals display unusual behavior some tens of seconds prior to a quake, it has been suggested they are responding to the [[P-wave]].<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=336}}; {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=1204}}.</ref> These travel through the ground about twice as fast as the [[S-wave]]s that cause most severe shaking.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref> They predict not the earthquake itself \u2014 that has already happened \u2014 but only the imminent arrival of the more destructive S-waves.\n\nIt has also been suggested that unusual behavior hours or even days beforehand could be triggered by foreshock activity at magnitudes that most people do not notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981|p=}}.</ref> Another confounding factor of accounts of unusual phenomena is skewing due to \"[[flashbulb memories]]\": otherwise unremarkable details become more memorable and more significant when associated with an emotionally powerful event such as an earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|Kulik|1977}}.</ref> A study that attempted to control for these kinds of factors found an increase in unusual animal behavior (possibly triggered by foreshocks) in one case, but not in four other cases of seemingly similar earthquakes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Howell|1981}}.  In an earlier study similar behavior was seen before storms. {{Harvnb|Lott|Hart|Verosub|Howell|1979|p=687}}.</ref>\n\n==== Dilatancy\u2013diffusion ====\nIn the 1970s the dilatancy\u2013diffusion hypothesis was highly regarded as providing a physical basis for various phenomena seen as possible earthquake precursors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> It was based on \"solid and repeatable evidence\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=217}}.</ref> from laboratory experiments that highly stressed crystalline rock experienced a change in volume, or ''dilatancy'',<ref>Subsequent ''diffusion'' of water back into the affected volume of rock is what leads to failure.  {{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref> which causes changes in other characteristics, such as seismic velocity and electrical resistivity, and even large-scale uplifts of topography.  It was believed this happened in a 'preparatory phase' just prior to the earthquake, and that suitable monitoring could therefore warn of an impending quake.\n\nDetection of variations in the relative velocities of the primary and secondary seismic waves \u2013 expressed as Vp/Vs \u2013 as they passed through a certain zone was the basis for predicting the 1973 Blue Mountain Lake (NY) and 1974 Riverside (CA) quake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hammond|1974}}.</ref> Although these predictions were informal and even trivial, their apparent success was seen as confirmation of both dilatancy and the existence of a preparatory process, leading to what were subsequently called \"wildly over-optimistic statements\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Main|Bell|Meredith|Geiger|2012|p=215}}.</ref> that successful earthquake prediction \"appears to be on the verge of practical reality.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|Sykes|Aggarwal|1973}}, quoted by {{Harvnb|Hammond|1973}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, many studies questioned these results,<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=333\u2013334}}; see also {{Harvnb|McEvilly|Johnson|1974}} and {{Harvnb|Lindh|Lockner|Lee|1978}}.</ref> and the hypothesis eventually languished.

One of these gases is [[radon]], produced by radioactive decay of the trace amounts of uranium present in most rock.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=333}}</ref>\n\nRadon is useful as a potential earthquake predictor because it is radioactive and thus easily detected,<ref>Giampaolo Giuiliani's claimed prediction of the [[#L'Aquila|L'Aquila]] earthquake was based on monitoring of radon levels.</ref> and its short [[half-life]] (3.8 days) makes radon levels sensitive to short-term fluctuations.

Other aspects of this will be discussed below.</ref> and in 2011 the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection concluded that the prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.<ref>{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|pp=335\u2013336}}.</ref> Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \"resoundingly debunked\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|p=195}}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \"natural time\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction.

Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54&nbsp;km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fraser-Smith|Bernardi|McGill|Ladd|1990| p=1467}} called it \"encouraging\".</ref>\n\nAdditional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed.  More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|2009}}</ref> or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Love|Johnston|2009}}</ref>\n\n===== Freund physics =====\n\nIn his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2000}}</ref> The study of such currents and interactions is known as \"Freund physics\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=133\u2013135}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Heraud|Centa|Bleier|2015}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Enriquez|2015}}</ref>\n\nMost seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hough|2010b|pages=137\u2013139}}</ref>\n\n====== Disturbance of the daily cycle of the ionosphere ======\n[[File:LAQUILA 2009 ULF.JPG|thumb|The ULF* recording of the D layer retention of the ionosphere which absorbs EM radiation during the nights before the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|earthquake in L'Aquila, Italy on 6/4/2009]]. The anomaly is indicated in red.]]\nThe [[ionosphere]] usually develops its lower [[Ionosphere#D layer|D layer]] during the day, while at night this layer disappears as the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] there turns to [[gas]]. During the night, the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]] of the ionosphere remains formed, in higher altitude than D layer. A [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|waveguide]] for low [[High frequency|HF]] radio frequencies up to 10&nbsp;MHz is formed during the night ([[skywave]] propagation) as the F layer reflects these waves back to the Earth. The skywave is lost during the day, as the D layer absorbs these waves.\n\nTectonic stresses in the Earth's crust are claimed to cause waves of electric charges<ref>{{harvnb|Freund|Takeuchi|Lau|2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Freund|Sornette|2007}}</ref> that travel to the surface of the Earth and affect the ionosphere.<ref>{{harvnb|Freund|Kulahci|Cyr|Ling|2009}}</ref> [[Ultra low frequency|ULF]]* recordings<ref>The literature on geophysical phenomena and ionospheric disturbances uses the term ULF (Ultra Low Frequency) to describe the frequency band below 10 Hz.

In this article the term ULF is listed as ULF*.</ref> of the daily cycle of the ionosphere indicate that the usual cycle could be disturbed a few days before a shallow strong earthquake. When the disturbance occurs, it is observed that either the D layer is lost during the day resulting to ionosphere elevation and skywave formation or the D layer appears at night resulting to lower of the ionosphere and hence absence of skywave.<ref>{{harvnb|Eftaxias|Athanasopoulou|Balasis|Kalimeri|2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Eftaxias|Balasis|Contoyiannis|Papadimitriou|2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tsolis|Xenos|2010}}</ref>\n\nScience centers have developed a network of VLF transmitters and receivers on a global scale that detect changes in skywave. Each receiver is also daisy transmitter for distances of 1000 - 10,000 kilometers and is operating at different frequencies within the network.

During the evaluation process, the background of daily variation and [[noise]] due to atmospheric disturbances and human activities are removed before visualizing the concentration of trends in the wider area of a fault.  This method has been experimentally applied since 1995.<ref>{{Harvnb|Filizzola|Pergola|Pietrapertosa|Tramutoli|2004}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lisi|Filizzola|Genzano|Grimaldi|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Pergola|Aliano|Coviello|Filizzola|2010}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Genzano|Aliano|Corrado|Filizzola|2009}}</ref>\n\nIn a newer approach to explain the phenomenon, [[NASA]]'s Friedmann Freund has proposed that the [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] captured by the satellites is not due to a real increase in the surface temperature of the crust. According to this version the emission is a result of the [[Quantum excitation (accelerator physics)|quantum excitation]] that occurs at the chemical re-bonding of [[Electric charge|positive charge]] carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]) which are traveling from the deepest layers to the surface of the crust at a speed of 200 meters per second. The electric charge arises as a result of increasing tectonic stresses as the time of the earthquake approaches. This emission extends superficially up to 500 x 500 square kilometers for very large events and stops almost immediately after the earthquake.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freund|2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Trends ===\n\nInstead of watching for anomalous phenomena that might be precursory signs of an impending earthquake, other approaches to predicting earthquakes look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches also tend to be more probabilistic, and to have larger time periods, and so merge into earthquake forecasting.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=for 'more probabilistic', for 'larger periods' and for 'earthquake forecasting' adaptation better than earthquake prediction}}\n\n==== Elastic rebound ====\n\nEven the stiffest of rock is not perfectly rigid.  Given a large force (such as between two immense tectonic plates moving past each other) the earth's crust will bend or deform. According to the [[elastic rebound]] theory of {{Harvtxt|Reid|1910}}, eventually the deformation (strain) becomes great enough that something breaks, usually at an existing fault.  Slippage along the break (an earthquake) allows the rock on each side to rebound to a less deformed state. In the process energy is released in various forms, including seismic waves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|1910|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=329}}.</ref> The cycle of tectonic force being accumulated in elastic deformation and released in a sudden rebound is then repeated. As the displacement from a single earthquake ranges from less than a meter to around 10 meters (for an M 8 quake),<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|Coppersmith|1994|loc=Fig.  11, p. 993}}.</ref> the demonstrated existence of large [[strike-slip]] displacements of hundreds of miles shows the existence of a long running earthquake cycle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zoback|2006}} provides a clear explanation.  {{Harvnb|Evans|1997|loc=\u00a72.2}} also provides a description of the \"self-organized criticality\" (SOC) paradigm that is displacing the elastic rebound model.</ref>\n\n==== Characteristic earthquakes ====\n\nThe most studied earthquake faults (such as the [[Nankai megathrust]], the [[Wasatch fault]], and the [[San Andreas fault]]) appear to have distinct segments.  The ''characteristic earthquake'' model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments.<ref>{{harvnb|Castellaro|2003}}</ref> As the lengths and other properties<ref>These include the type of rock and fault geometry.</ref> of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which is limited by the length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment.  Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwartz|Coppersmith|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2|p=93}}.</ref> For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely [[return period]]) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. [[UCERF3]] is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California.<ref>{{Harvnb|UCERF|2008}}.</ref> Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.\n\nThe idea of characteristic earthquakes was the basis of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]]: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, with a standard deviation of \u00b13.1 years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=619}}. Of course these were not the only earthquakes in this period. The attentive reader will recall that, in seismically active areas, earthquakes of some magnitude happen fairly constantly.  The \"Parkfield earthquakes\" are either the ones noted in the historical record, or were selected from the instrumental record on the basis of location and magnitude.  {{Harvtxt|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S399}} and {{Harvtxt|Kagan|1997|pp=211\u2013212, 213}} argue that the selection parameters can bias the statistics, and that sequences of four or six quakes, with different recurrence intervals, are also plausible.</ref> Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bakun|Lindh|1985|p=621}}.</ref> The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the ''trend'', which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters.  However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S408}} say the claim of quasi-periodicity is \"baseless\".</ref>\n\nThe failure of the [[#Parkfield|Parkfield prediction]] has raised doubt as to the validity of the characteristic earthquake model itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}.</ref> Some studies have questioned the various assumptions, including the key one that earthquakes are constrained within segments, and suggested that the \"characteristic earthquakes\" may be an artifact of selection bias and the shortness of seismological records (relative to earthquake cycles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,420}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Friedrich|Newman|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Tiampo|Shcherbakov|2012|loc=\u00a72.2}}, and references there; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|Geller|2012}}. See also the Nature debates.</ref> Other studies have considered whether other factors need to be considered, such as the age of the fault.<ref>Young faults are expected to have complex, irregular surfaces, which impede slippage. In time these rough spots are ground off, changing the mechanical characteristics of the fault.  {{Harvnb|Cowan|Nicol|Tonkin|1996}}; {{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004|p=185}}.</ref> Whether earthquake ruptures are more generally constrained within a segment (as is often seen), or break past segment boundaries (also seen), has a direct bearing on the degree of earthquake hazard: earthquakes are larger where multiple segments break, but in relieving more strain they will happen less often.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stein|Newman|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Seismic gaps ====\n\nAt the contact where two tectonic plates slip past each other every section must eventually slip, as (in the long-term) none get left behind.  But they do not all slip at the same time; different sections will be at different stages in the cycle of strain (deformation) accumulation and sudden rebound. In the seismic gap model the \"next big quake\" should be expected not in the segments where recent seismicity has relieved the strain, but in the intervening gaps where the unrelieved strain is the greatest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholz|2002|loc=\u00a75.3.3|p=284}}; {{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|Jackson|Kagan|2006|p=S404}}.</ref> This model has an intuitive appeal; it is used in long-term forecasting, and was the basis of a series of circum-Pacific ([[Pacific Rim]]) forecasts in 1979 and 1989\u20131991.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kagan|Jackson|1991|pp=21,419}}; {{Harvnb|McCann|Nishenko|Sykes|Krause|1979}}; {{Harvnb|Rong|Jackson|Kagan|2003}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, some underlying assumptions about seismic gaps are now known to be incorrect.

Probably the most widely known is the M8 family of algorithms (including the RTP method) developed under the leadership of [[Vladimir Keilis-Borok]].

(2019)\u00a0 reported having successfully trained a regression [[random forest]] on acoustic time series data capable of identifying a signal emitted from fault zones that forecasts fault failure. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) suggested that the identified signal, previously assumed to be statistical noise, reflects the increasing emission of energy before its sudden release during a slip event. Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) further postulated that their approach could bound fault failure times and lead to the identification of other unknown signals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rouet-Leduc|first=Bertrand|last2=Hulbert|first2=Claudia|last3=Lubbers|first3=Nicholas|last4=Barros|first4=Kipton|last5=Humphreys|first5=Colin|last6=Johnson|first6=Paul A.|date=2017-09-28|title=Machine Learning Predicts Laboratory Earthquakes|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05774|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=44|issue=18|pages=9276\u20139282|doi=10.1002/2017GL074677}}</ref> Due to the rarity of the most catastrophic earthquakes, acquiring representative data remains problematic. In response, Rouet-Leduc et al. (2019) have conjectured that their model would not need to train on data from catastrophic earthquakes, since further research has shown the seismic patterns of interest to be similar in smaller earthquakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-takes-on-earthquake-prediction-20190919/|title=Artificial Intelligence Takes On Earthquake Prediction|last=Smart|first=Ashley|website=Quanta Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nDeep learning has also been applied to earthquake prediction. Although [[Bath's Law|Bath\u2019s law]] and [[Omori's law|Omori\u2019s law]] describe the magnitude of earthquake aftershocks and their time-varying properties, the prediction of the \u201cspatial distribution of aftershocks\u201d remains an open research problem. Using the [[Theano (software)|Theano]] and [[TensorFlow]] software libraries, DeVries et al. (2018) trained a [[neural network]] that achieved higher accuracy in the prediction of spatial distributions of earthquake aftershocks than the previously established methodology of Coulomb failure stress change. Notably, DeVries et al. (2018) reported that their model made no \u201cassumptions about receiver plane orientation or geometry\u201d and heavily weighted the change in shear stress, \u201csum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor,\u201d and the von Mises yield criterion. DeVries et al. (2018) postulated that the reliance of their model on these physical quantities indicated that they might \u201ccontrol earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.\u201d For validation testing, DeVries et al. (2018) reserved 10% of positive training earthquake data samples and an equal quantity of randomly chosen negative samples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeVries|first=Phoebe M.

Additionally, Shah noted that simpler neural networks than the 6 layer model devised by DeVries et al. (2018) could have achieved similar performance. When prompted by Shah to address these criticisms, Nature declined to modify Devries et al.

Mignan and Broccardo (2019) also found that neural networks utilized in earthquake prediction with notable success rates were matched in performance by simpler models. Mignan and Broccardo (2019) further addressed the issues of acquiring appropriate data for training neural networks to predict earthquakes, writing that the \u201cstructured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogues\u201d makes transparent machine learning models more desirable than artificial neural networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mignan|first=Arnaud|last2=Broccardo|first2=Marco|date=2019-10-02|title=Neural Network Applications in Earthquake Prediction (1994-2019): Meta-Analytic Insight on their Limitations|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01178|journal=arXiv:1910.01178 [physics]}}</ref>\n\n== Notable predictions ==\nThese are predictions, or claims of predictions, that are notable either scientifically or because of public notoriety, and claim a scientific or quasi-scientific basis.

Since the middle ages the fortress was the namesake and centre of the main fief and later main county of [[Akershus]], which was originally one of Norway's four main regions and which included most of [[Eastern Norway]]. The fortress itself was located within Akershus main county until 1919, and also within the smaller Akershus sub county until 1842.\n\nThe castle has also been used as a military base, a prison and is currently the temporary [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|office]] of the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime minister of Norway]].<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/smk/kontakt/id883/</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nIt is not known exactly when the construction of the [[List of Norwegian Fortresses|castle]] started but it is believed that it took place around the late 1290s, by [[Haakon V of Norway|King Haakon&nbsp;V]], replacing [[T\u00f8nsberg Fortress|T\u00f8nsberg]] as one of the two most important Norwegian castles of the period (the other being [[B\u00e5hus Fortress|B\u00e5hus]]). It was constructed in response to the Norwegian nobleman, Earl [[Alv Erlingsson]] of [[Sarpsborg]]\u2019s earlier attack on Oslo that occurred in 1287. In the aftermath of the attack, it became clear that the city\u2019s existing defences weren\u2019t effective and therefore, a stronger defensive centre was needed.\n\nThe castle is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1300 in a letter from King Haakon to a church in Oslo. However, the letter does not mention how far the construction of the castle had progressed by then.\n\nThe fortress has successfully survived all sieges, primarily by [[Sweden|Swedish]] forces, including those by forces led by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] in 1716.\n\n==Military use==\n=== The Middle Ages ===\nThe fortress was first used in battle in 1308, when it was besieged by the Swedish duke [[Eric, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Eric]] of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose brother won the Swedish throne in 1309. The siege was eventually broken by a local Norwegian army in a battle. (This battle forms a major part of the plot of [[Sigrid Undset]]'s historical novel ''In the Wilderness'', the third volume of her tetralogy ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''.)\n\n=== Renaissance and Denmark-Norway ===\nIn 1449-1450 the castle was besieged again, this time by the Swedish king [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson Bonde]], but he had to lift the siege after a while. The castle was not besieged again until 1502 when Scottish soldiers in the service of the Danish king besieged the castle in order to regain it from the hands of the Norwegian nobleman [[Knut Alvsson]].\n\nAkershus was besieged yet again in 1523, this time by Swedish soldiers but Oslo\u2019s inhabitants, at the command of Hans Mule, burned down their houses in an attempt to drive them out and the Swedes retreated after a short period.<ref>https://nbl.snl.no/Hans_Mule</ref> King Christian II besieged the castle from 1531 to 1532 but the siege was lifted by forces from Denmark and L\u00fcbeck. After this siege the castle was improved and strengthened.\n\nIn 1567, during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], the castle was besieged once more by Swedish forces, but the Danish king's lord lieutenant, [[Christen Munk]], responded by [[Scorched earth|burning down the city]] in order to deprive the attackers themselves of the means of receiving supplies, and eventually the Swedes retreated.\n\nThe immediate proximity of the sea was a key feature, for [[navy|naval power]] was a vital [[military]] [[force]] as the majority of Norwegian commerce in that period was by sea. The fortress was strategically important for the capital, and therefore, [[Norway]] as well. Whoever controlled Akershus fortress ruled Norway.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:German surrender of Akershus Fortress.jpg|thumb|left|The German garnison's commander Major {{Interlanguage link|Josef Nichterlein|no}} and his aide Captain Johannes Hamel handing the fortress over to the Norwegian resistance movement's [[Terje Rollem]] (May 11, 1945)]]\n\nThe fortress has never successfully been [[besiege]]d by a foreign enemy. However it surrendered without combat to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 when the Norwegian government evacuated the capital in the face of the unprovoked German assault on [[Denmark]] and Norway (see [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]).\n\nDuring World War II, people were executed here by the German occupiers, including members of the [[Pelle group]]. The fortress was liberated on 11 May 1945, when it was handed over to [[Terje Rollem]] on behalf of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]. After the war, eight Norwegian traitors who had been tried for war crimes and sentenced to death were also executed at the fortress. Among those executed were [[Vidkun Quisling]] and [[Siegfried Fehmer]].\n{{clearleft}}\n\n== Royal residence ==\n[[File:Akershus slott 20090503-08.jpg|thumb|The hall of [[King Christian IV]]]]\n\n=== During the Middle Ages ===\n\nAfter construction of the castle was finished around 1300, [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] gradually started to use the castle as a residential palace, favoring the keep over the [[Oslo Kongsg\u00e5rd estate|Oslo Kongsgard Estate]] despite the fact that the castle likely was unsuited as a residence.<ref>{{Citation|title=NRK TV - Se Akershus slott og festning gjennom 700 \u00e5r|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/akershus-slott-og-festning-gjennom-700-aar/FOLA00009077/25-12-1979#t=3m4s|language=no|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref> The castle becoming a royal residence also played a significant role in the process where the capital for [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norway]] was moved from [[Bergen]] to [[Oslo]].

The fortress was subsequently modernized and remodeled, with the new appearance being that of a [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance castle]] with Italian inspired [[bastions]]. The castle primarily functioned as a palace until the turn of the 19th century, with new towers, halls, chambers and gates being added over time.\n\nWhen the king was absent, the castle functioned as the seat of the [[List of heads of government of Norway|Steward of Norway]].\n\n==Prison==\nAkershus has also been a prison, with a section of it known as ''The Slavery'' ({{lang-no|Slaveriet}}) because the prisoners could be rented out for work in the city. It has housed many rebels and criminals through Norwegian history. Particularly well-known people to have been imprisoned there include author [[Gjest Baardsen]] (1791\u20131849), and the similarly idealized thief [[Ole H\u00f8iland]]. Also, many early Norwegian [[socialists]] (supporters of [[Marcus Thrane]], 1817\u20131890) also spent time in the cells of Akershus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dramatiker.no/index.php?id=18591|title=Norske Dramatikeres Forbund Raud vinter|publisher=Dramatiker.no|date=|accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> The prison was also a plot element in the film ''[[Fante-Anne]]'' (1920).\n\n===Kautokeino rebellion prisoners===\nFollowing the 1852 [[Laestadian]] [[Sami revolt in Guovdageaidnu|S\u00e1mi revolt in Guovdageaidnu]], all men except the two leaders [[Aslak H\u00e6tta]] and [[Mons Somby]] (who were beheaded in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]]) ended up in Akershus Fortress \u2013 the women were imprisoned in [[Trondheim]].

Since the middle ages the fortress was the namesake and centre of the main fief and later main county of [[Akershus]], which was originally one of Norway's four main regions and which included most of [[Eastern Norway]]. The fortress itself was located within Akershus main county until 1919, and also within the smaller Akershus sub county until 1842.\n\nThe castle has also been used as a military base, a prison and is currently the temporary [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|office]] of the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime minister of Norway]].<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/smk/kontakt/id883/</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nIt is not known exactly when the construction of the [[List of Norwegian Fortresses|castle]] started but it is believed that it took place around the late 1290s, by [[Haakon V of Norway|King Haakon&nbsp;V]], replacing [[T\u00f8nsberg Fortress|T\u00f8nsberg]] as one of the two most important Norwegian castles of the period (the other being [[B\u00e5hus Fortress|B\u00e5hus]]). It was constructed in response to the Norwegian nobleman, Earl [[Alv Erlingsson]] of [[Sarpsborg]]\u2019s earlier attack on Oslo that occurred in 1287. In the aftermath of the attack, it became clear that the city\u2019s existing defences weren\u2019t effective and therefore, a stronger defensive centre was needed.\n\nThe castle is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1300 in a letter from King Haakon to a church in Oslo. However, the letter does not mention how far the construction of the castle had progressed by then.\n\nThe fortress has successfully survived all sieges, primarily by [[Sweden|Swedish]] forces, including those by forces led by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] in 1716.\n\n==Military use==\n=== The Middle Ages ===\nThe fortress was first used in battle in 1308, when it was besieged by the Swedish duke [[Eric, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Eric]] of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose brother won the Swedish throne in 1309. The siege was eventually broken by a local Norwegian army in a battle. (This battle forms a major part of the plot of [[Sigrid Undset]]'s historical novel ''In the Wilderness'', the third volume of her tetralogy ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''.)\n\n=== Renaissance and Denmark-Norway ===\nIn 1449-1450 the castle was besieged again, this time by the Swedish king [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson Bonde]], but he had to lift the siege after a while. The castle was not besieged again until 1502 when Scottish soldiers in the service of the Danish king besieged the castle in order to regain it from the hands of the Norwegian nobleman [[Knut Alvsson]].\n\nAkershus was besieged yet again in 1523, this time by Swedish soldiers but Oslo\u2019s inhabitants burned down their houses in an attempt to drive them out and the Swedes retreated after a short period. King Christian II besieged the castle from 1531 to 1532 but the siege was lifted by forces from Denmark and L\u00fcbeck. After this siege the castle was improved and strengthened.\n\nIn 1567, during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], the castle was besieged once more by Swedish forces, but the Danish king's lord lieutenant, [[Christen Munk]], responded by [[Scorched earth|burning down the city]] in order to deprive the attackers themselves of the means of receiving supplies, and eventually the Swedes retreated.\n\nThe immediate proximity of the sea was a key feature, for [[navy|naval power]] was a vital [[military]] [[force]] as the majority of Norwegian commerce in that period was by sea. The fortress was strategically important for the capital, and therefore, [[Norway]] as well. Whoever controlled Akershus fortress ruled Norway.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:German surrender of Akershus Fortress.jpg|thumb|left|The German garnison's commander Major {{Interlanguage link|Josef Nichterlein|no}} and his aide Captain Johannes Hamel handing the fortress over to the Norwegian resistance movement's [[Terje Rollem]] (May 11, 1945)]]\n\nThe fortress has never successfully been [[besiege]]d by a foreign enemy. However it surrendered without combat to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 when the Norwegian government evacuated the capital in the face of the unprovoked German assault on [[Denmark]] and Norway (see [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]).\n\nDuring World War II, people were executed here by the German occupiers, including members of the [[Pelle group]]. The fortress was liberated on 11 May 1945, when it was handed over to [[Terje Rollem]] on behalf of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]. After the war, eight Norwegian traitors who had been tried for war crimes and sentenced to death were also executed at the fortress. Among those executed were [[Vidkun Quisling]] and [[Siegfried Fehmer]].\n{{clearleft}}\n\n== Royal residence ==\n[[File:Akershus slott 20090503-08.jpg|thumb|The hall of [[King Christian IV]]]]\n\n=== During the Middle Ages ===\n\nAfter construction of the castle was finished around 1300, [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] gradually started to use the castle as a residential palace, favoring the keep over the [[Oslo Kongsg\u00e5rd estate|Oslo Kongsgard Estate]] despite the fact that the castle likely was unsuited as a residence.<ref>{{Citation|title=NRK TV - Se Akershus slott og festning gjennom 700 \u00e5r|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/akershus-slott-og-festning-gjennom-700-aar/FOLA00009077/25-12-1979#t=3m4s|language=no|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref> The castle becoming a royal residence also played a significant role in the process where the capital for [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norway]] was moved from [[Bergen]] to [[Oslo]].

The fortress was subsequently modernized and remodeled, with the new appearance being that of a [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance castle]] with Italian inspired [[bastions]]. The castle primarily functioned as a palace until the turn of the 19th century, with new towers, halls, chambers and gates being added over time.\n\nWhen the king was absent, the castle functioned as the seat of the [[List of heads of government of Norway|Steward of Norway]].\n\n==Prison==\nAkershus has also been a prison, with a section of it known as ''The Slavery'' ({{lang-no|Slaveriet}}) because the prisoners could be rented out for work in the city. It has housed many rebels and criminals through Norwegian history. Particularly well-known people to have been imprisoned there include author [[Gjest Baardsen]] (1791\u20131849), and the similarly idealized thief [[Ole H\u00f8iland]].

[[Abdul Sheriff]] reported that when he left for his twelve years of \"empire building\" on the mainland, he had no plantations of his own. By 1895, he had acquired \"seven 'shambas' [plantations] and 10,000 slaves\".<ref>Sheriff, 108</ref>\n\nHe met and helped several famous western explorers of the [[Africa|African continent]], including [[David Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley]].<ref name=Stanley>Stanley, H. M., 1899, ''Through the Dark Continent'', London: G. Newnes, Vol. One {{ISBN|0486256677}}, Vol. Two {{ISBN|0486256685}}</ref>{{rp|Vol. Two,91\u201397}} Between 1884 and 1887 he claimed the [[Congo (area)|Eastern Congo]] for himself and for the Sultan of Zanzibar, [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Bargash bin Said el Busaidi]]. In spite of his position as protector of Zanzibar's interests in [[Congo (area)|Congo]], he managed to maintain good relations with the Europeans. When, in August 1886, fighting broke out between the Swahili and the representatives of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] at [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], al-Murjab\u012b went to the Belgian consul at [[Zanzibar]] to assure him of his \"good intentions\". Although he was still a force in Central African politics, he could see by 1886 that power in the region was shifting. \n\n===Governor of the Stanley Falls District===\nIn early 1887, Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the [[Congo Free State]]. Both Leopold and Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar]] agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.<ref>Bennett and Brode</ref> At the same time, he agreed to man the expedition which Stanley had been commissioned to organize for the purpose of rescuing [[Emin Pasha]] (E. Schnitzer), the German governor of [[Equatoria]] (a region of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt]], today in South Sudan) who had been stranded in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] area as a result of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdi]] uprising in Sudan.{{citation needed|date= January 2016}}\n\nTippu Tip traveled back to the Upper Congo in the company of Stanley, but this time by way of the Atlantic coast and up the Congo River. Aside from its doubtful usefulness, the relief expedition was marred by the near annihilation of its rearguard, a disaster for which Stanley attempted to place the blame on Tippu Tip.\n\n===Congo\u2013Arab War===\nAfter his tenure as governor, the [[Congo\u2013Arab War]] broke out. Both sides fought with armies consisting mostly of local African soldiers fighting under the command of either Arab or European leaders. \n\nWhen Tippu Tip left the Congo, the authority of King Leopold's Free State was still very weak in the Eastern parts of the territory and the power lay largely with local Arabic or Swahili strongmen. Amongst these were Tippu Tip's son [[Sefu bin Hamed]] and a trader known as [[Rumaliza]] in the area close to [[Lake Tanganyika]].  \n\nIn 1892, Sefu bin Hamed attacked Belgian ivory traders, who were seen as a threat to the Arab-Swahili trade. The Free State government sent a force under commander [[Francis Dhanis]] to the East. Dhanis had an early success when the African warlord Ngongo Lutete changed sides from Sefu's to his. The better armed and organized Belgian force defeated their opponents in several fights until the death of Sefu on 20 October 1893, and finally forcing also Rumaliza to flee to German territory in 1895.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:ZanzibarTipputip.jpg|thumb|250px|House of Tippu Tip in Stone Town, Zanzibar City]]\nAfter returning to Zanzibar around 1890/91, Tippu Tip retired. He set out to write an account of his life, which is the first example of the literary genre of autobiography in the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]]. Dr. Heinrich Brode, who knew him in Zanzibar, transcribed the manuscript into Roman script and translated it into German. It was subsequently translated into English and published in Britain in 1907<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.72620/page/n3 Tippoo Tib, The story of his career in Central Africa, narrated from his own accounts by  Dr. Heinrich Brode, London, Edward Arnold 1907]</ref>.\n\nTippu Tip died June 13, 1905, of [[malaria]] (according to Brode) in his home in [[Stone Town]], the main town on the island of Zanzibar.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|title=Arab vs. European: Diplomacy and war in Nineteenth-Century East Central Africa|last=Bennett |first=Norman Robert |location=New York |publisher=Africana Publishing Company |year=1986}}\n* {{cite book|title=Tippoo Tib: The Story of His Career in Zanzibar & Central Africa |last=Brode |first=Heinrich |translator-last1=Havelock |translator-first1=H. |contribution=Preface |contributor-last=Elliot |contributor-first=Charles |location=London |publisher=Arnold |year=1907 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028752644/cu31924028752644_djvu.txt}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Troubled Heart of Africa: A History of the Congo |url=https://archive.org/details/troubledheartofa00edge |url-access=registration |last=Edgerton |first=Robert B. |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-30486-2}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Fall of the Congo Arabs |last=Hinde |first=Sidney Langford |year=1897 |publisher=Methuen & co. |location=London |isbn=978-1313986960 |url=https://archive.org/stream/fallofcongoarabs00hind/fallofcongoarabs00hind_djvu.txt}}\n* Maisha ya Hamed bin Mohammed el Murjebi yaani Tippu Tip kwa maneno yake mwenyewe, kimefasiriwa na W.H.

By 1895, he had acquired \"seven 'shambas' [plantations] and 10,000 slaves\".<ref>Sheriff, 108</ref>\n\nHe met and helped several famous western explorers of the [[Africa|African continent]], including [[David Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley]].<ref name=Stanley>Stanley, H. M., 1899, ''Through the Dark Continent'', London: G. Newnes, Vol. One {{ISBN|0486256677}}, Vol. Two {{ISBN|0486256685}}</ref>{{rp|Vol. Two,91\u201397}} Between 1884 and 1887 he claimed the [[Congo (area)|Eastern Congo]] for himself and for the Sultan of Zanzibar, [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Bargash bin Said el Busaidi]]. In spite of his position as protector of Zanzibar's interests in [[Congo (area)|Congo]], he managed to maintain good relations with the Europeans. When, in August 1886, fighting broke out between the Swahili and the representatives of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] at [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], al-Murjab\u012b went to the Belgian consul at [[Zanzibar]] to assure him of his \"good intentions\". Although he was still a force in Central African politics, he could see by 1886 that power in the region was shifting. \n\n===Governor of the Stanley Falls District===\nIn early 1887, Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the [[Congo Free State]]. Both Leopold and Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar]] agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.<ref>Bennett and Brode</ref> At the same time, he agreed to man the expedition which Stanley had been commissioned to organize for the purpose of rescuing [[Emin Pasha]] (E. Schnitzer), the German governor of [[Equatoria]] (a region of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt]], today in South Sudan) who had been stranded in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] area as a result of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdi]] uprising in Sudan.{{citation needed|date= January 2016}}\n\nTippu Tip traveled back to the Upper Congo in the company of Stanley, but this time by way of the Atlantic coast and up the Congo River. Aside from its doubtful usefulness, the relief expedition was marred by the near annihilation of its rearguard, a disaster for which Stanley attempted to place the blame on Tippu Tip.\n\n===Congo\u2013Arab War===\nAfter his tenure as governor, the [[Congo\u2013Arab War]] broke out. Both sides fought with armies consisting mostly of local African soldiers fighting under the command of either Arab or European leaders. \n\nWhen Tippu Tip left the Congo, the authority of King Leopold's Free State was still very weak in the Eastern parts of the territory and the power lay largely with local Arabic or Swahili strongmen. Amongst these were Tippu Tip's son [[Sefu bin Hamed]] and a trader known as [[Rumaliza]] in the area close to Lake Tanganyika.  \n\nIn 1892, Sefu bin Hamed attacked Belgian ivory traders, who were seen as a threat to the Arab-Swahili trade. The Free State government sent a force under commander [[Francis Dhanis]] to the East. Dhanis had an early success when the African warlord Ngongo Lutete changed sides from Sefu's to his. The better armed and organized Belgian force defeated their opponents in several fights until the death of Sefu on 20 October 1893, and finally forcing also Rumaliza to flee to German territory in 1895.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:ZanzibarTipputip.jpg|thumb|250px|House of Tippu Tip in Stone Town, Zanzibar City]]\nAfter returning to Zanzibar around 1890/91, Tippu Tip retired. He set out to write an account of his life, which is the first example of the literary genre of autobiography in the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]]. Dr. Heinrich Brode, who knew him in Zanzibar, transcribed the manuscript into Roman script and translated it into German. It was subsequently translated into English and published in Britain in 1907<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.72620/page/n3 Tippoo Tib, The story of his career in Central Africa, narrated from his own accounts by  Dr. Heinrich Brode, London, Edward Arnold 1907]</ref>.\n\nTippu Tip died June 13, 1905, of [[malaria]] (according to Brode) in his home in [[Stone Town]], the main town on the island of Zanzibar.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|title=Arab vs. European: Diplomacy and war in Nineteenth-Century East Central Africa|last=Bennett |first=Norman Robert |location=New York |publisher=Africana Publishing Company |year=1986}}\n* {{cite book|title=Tippoo Tib: The Story of His Career in Zanzibar & Central Africa |last=Brode |first=Heinrich |translator-last1=Havelock |translator-first1=H. |contribution=Preface |contributor-last=Elliot |contributor-first=Charles |location=London |publisher=Arnold |year=1907 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028752644/cu31924028752644_djvu.txt}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Troubled Heart of Africa: A History of the Congo |url=https://archive.org/details/troubledheartofa00edge |url-access=registration |last=Edgerton |first=Robert B. |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-30486-2}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Fall of the Congo Arabs |last=Hinde |first=Sidney Langford |year=1897 |publisher=Methuen & co. |location=London |isbn=978-1313986960 |url=https://archive.org/stream/fallofcongoarabs00hind/fallofcongoarabs00hind_djvu.txt}}\n* Maisha ya Hamed bin Mohammed el Murjebi yaani Tippu Tip kwa maneno yake mwenyewe, kimefasiriwa na W.H.

The player has access to a wide variety of tools, most of which are unlocked by completing jobs and earning experience.

This can be done by purchasing a replacement component or, at higher levels, repairing the existing one. Engines are rendered in a great deal of detail, requiring the player to remove parts in a realistic manner in order to access the relevant component. In order to complete the required task, the player must use realistic hardware like a tire balancer, spring puller, detailing kit and engine mount.\n\nFurther sections of the workroom become unlocked over the course of the game.

[[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point.   Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town.

Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS [https://www.mohs.gov.mm/]|.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look. \nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'').\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. \nThe average annual temperature in [[Aungban|Aungpan]] is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F). \nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F).

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to Aungpan branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from [[Yangon]].

It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| native_name = {{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}\n| official_name = Aungpan\n|pushpin_map = Burma\n|pushpin_map_caption = Location in Burma\n|image_skyline = Aungban.jpg\n|image_map = \n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Shan State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Burma|Districts]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Taunggyi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Kalaw Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 = \n|population = \n|population_as_of = 2014\n\n|population_blank1            = [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Danu people|Danu]], [[Bamar]], [[Pa-O]], [[Taungyo]], [[Burmese Chinese]], [[Burmese Indians]], [[Burmese Gurkha|Gurkha]]\n|population_blank1_title     = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Theravada Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_total = 30,313\n\n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Myanmar#Asia\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location of Aungpan, Myanmar\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|20|40|0|N|96|38|0|E|type:town_region:MM|display=inline,title}}\n\n\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|established_date = 1913\n|established_title = Founded\n|elevation_ft = 4219\n|elevation_m =  1286\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset               = +6.30\n|area_code                = 081\n|postal_code_type         = [[Postal code]] [http://www.myanmaposts.net.mm/]\n|postal_code              = 06022\n|registration_plate       = SHN\n|website                  =\n}}\n\n'''Aungpan''' ({{lang-my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town located in the Southern [[Shan State]].

When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. \nThe average annual temperature in [[Aungban|Aungpan]] is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F). \nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F). At 14.2 \u00b0C (57.6 \u00b0F) on average, January is the coldest month of the year.\nIn a year, the rainfall is 1654 mm (65.1 inches).\nThe difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is 290 mm (11 inches). \nThe variation in annual temperature is around 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Aungban|Aungpan]] (1982\u20132012)\n| single line  = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| width = auto\n\n| Jan low C = 6.8\n| Feb low C = 7.6\n| Mar low C = 11.9\n| Apr low C = 16.1\n| May low C = 17\n| Jun low C = 17.4\n| Jul low C = 17.4\n| Aug low C = 17.6\n| Sep low C = 17.1\n| Oct low C = 15.6\n| Nov low C = 11.7\n| Dec low C = 8.2\n| year low C = 13.7\n\n| Jan high C = 21.7\n| Feb high C = 23.3\n| Mar high C = 27.3\n| Apr high C = 29.3\n| May high C = 26.8\n| Jun high C = 24.7\n| Jul high C = 24.1\n| Aug high C = 24\n| Sep high C = 24.7\n| Oct high C = 24.3\n| Nov high C = 22.6\n| Dec high C = 20.9\n| year high C = 24.5\n\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 3\n| Feb rain mm = 5\n| Mar rain mm = 13\n| Apr rain mm = 50\n| May rain mm = 205\n| Jun rain mm = 244\n| Jul rain mm = 274\n| Aug rain mm = 293\n| Sep rain mm = 259\n| Oct rain mm = 209 \n| Nov rain mm = 84\n| Dec rain mm = 15\n| year rain mm = 137.8\n| source 1 = [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]<ref name=\"metno\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008145507/http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | archivedate = 8 October 2018 | url = http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | title = Myanmar Climate Report | publisher = Norwegian Meteorological Institute | pages =23\u201336  | accessdate = 28 October 2018}}</ref> \n}}\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to:\n* Regional campus '''[[Yezin Agricultural University]] (YAU)''' \n\nEducation service centers are also getting common in the town for a decade ago.

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to Aungpan branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from [[Yangon]].

(February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of [[Yangon]]'s [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the '''[[Myanmar]]''' calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as '''[[Inle Lake]]''' and '''[[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]]''', and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "name_user": "Kmthu.ytu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAungchanthar Pagoda", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aungban"}

Produced by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Family Entertainment]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation]], it was co-directed by Paul Sabella and Larry Leker. [[Dom DeLuise]] reprises his role from the first film, alongside new cast members [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]], respectively. New characters are voiced by [[Sheena Easton]], [[Adam Wylie]] and [[George Hearn]].\n\n[[Don Bluth]], the director of the original film, had no involvement with it. It was the second of only two theatrical sequels to a film directed by [[Don Bluth]] to not involve Bluth himself, the first being ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', as 13  sequels to ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' and a single sequel to ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' were direct-to-video releases along with two sequels of ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1998\u20132000, as well as ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. This was [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s last theatrically released animated film until ''[[Igor (film)|Igor]]'' (2008). It had a DVD double feature release with the first one on March 14, 2006 and January 18, 2011. It was also released on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011.\n\nThe film also served as the series premiere for the ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nDecades after [[All Dogs Go to Heaven|the events of the first movie]], Charlie B. Barkin ([[Charlie Sheen]]) welcomes his friend, Itchy ([[Dom DeLuise]]), to [[Heaven]], but states he is disillusioned by the afterlife. Their old nemesis, Carface Caruthers ([[Ernest Borgnine]]), steals [[Gabriel]]'s Horn, but loses it somewhere over [[San Francisco]] in his attempt to escape with it. The dog angels are alerted of the horn's theft by Anabelle, the head angel ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]), who sends Charlie and Itchy to Earth to retrieve it, and gives them one miracle to use. Upon arrival in San Francisco, they discover that they are [[ghost]]s, and therefore unable to interact with the physical world. At a tavern where Charlie flirts with a beautiful and charming [[Irish Setter]] named Sasha La Fleur ([[Sheena Easton]]), Carface appears in a [[Human body|corporeal]] form granted by a red dog collar created by Red ([[George Hearn]]), an elderly dog fortune teller who gives Charlie and Itchy equivalent collars effective for a single day. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to the duo, Red reveals his true form as a large [[demon]]ic [[cat]] who intends to take the horn for himself with Carface's help.\n\nCharlie and Itchy meet Sasha and an 8-year-old human boy she is looking after named David ([[Adam Wylie]]), who ran away from home to become a [[Street performance|street performer]] doing [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]], the former leading him to believe that he is his [[guardian angel]]. Before leaving for \"Easy Street\", Charlie uses his miracle in the form of a lustful kiss (which Sasha is disgusted by) to grant Sasha the ability to converse with David. Upon seeing the horn being taken into a police station, they rescue it, with Carface failing to steal it from them. Refusing to return to Heaven, Charlie hides it in a [[lobster trap]]. On Easy Street, they entertain an audience with magic tricks, but the act is ruined by a combination of a rainstorm and falling into a fountain. David finally reveals that he believes that his father and stepmother, who are expecting a new baby, will care less for him once it's born; but is persuaded otherwise by Charlie. As Charlie and Sasha share a tender moment, his collar vanishes, and he and Itchy become ghosts again.\n\nCarface then kidnaps David and demands that Charlie bring Gabriel's horn to [[Alcatraz Island]] and give it to Red in exchange for David's life. Determined to fulfill his promise to get David home, Charlie approaches Red, who presses him to give him the horn. He does so, and Red uses it to capture Heaven's canine angels (including Annabelle) and send them to Earth in the prison cells while opening a portal to permanently connect the human world to Hell. While Carface flees for cover, not wanting to get in Red's way - Charlie, Itchy, Sasha, and David stay to challenge Red and steal the horn which Charlie then plays to free the angels and send Red back to [[Hell]] which also seals the portal. Carface comes out of hiding and attempts to downplay his involvement. However, Red returns (briefly reopening the portal) and drags Carface into Hell, which reveals to everyone that Carface had unknowingly sold his soul to him in exchange for his collar.\n\nWith their mission accomplished, Charlie and Itchy are spirited away to Heaven along with Dr. Freeman; much to the upset of David and Sasha (who finally admits that she is in love with Charlie). Charlie gives the horn back to Anabelle in exchange for a new life and says yet another goodbye to Itchy, who decides to remain in Heaven. After he happily reunites with Sasha and David, they head to the latter's house where he returns and reconciles with his father and stepmother. His stepmother is relieved that he is alive and explains she has been worried about him and says just because she is pregnant does not mean she does not love him as well and that they are all a family. They then adopt Charlie and Sasha, and the two share a kiss, happy with their new life together.\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\n\n==Voice cast== \n[[Burt Reynolds]], [[Vic Tayback]] and [[Melba Moore]] are replaced by [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]]; however, three characters were written out of the [[sequel]]. Anne-Marie was written out of the story due to the murder of [[Judith Barsi]] in July 25, 1988, while Killer and Flo were written out of the story because [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] and [[Loni Anderson]] chose not to return to their roles from the first film{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} (although Reilly returned for the third movie and the TV series).\n\n;Main characters\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Charles \"Charlie\" B. Barkin, a [[German Shepherd]] who returns from Heaven to find Gabriel's Horn. It is revealed that as a puppy, he ran away from home (which explains the absence of Charlie's parents, who were briefly shown in the original film in the records book in the song \"Let Me Be Surprised\"), a point he mentions to David to convince him to return home. Charlie Sheen replaced [[Burt Reynolds]] from the first film due to Reynolds participating in the 1996 films ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'', ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' and ''[[Mad Dog Time]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n** [[Jesse Corti]] as Charlie's singing voice. \n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchiford \"Itchy\" [[Dachshund]], Charlie's best friend. He wants to find the horn and go straight back to Heaven. Dom DeLuise was the only original actor to reprise his role from the first film.\n* [[Sheena Easton]] as Sasha la Fleur, an attractive [[Irish Setter]], talented lounge singer and Charlie's love interest. \n* [[Adam Wylie]] as David, a disillusioned 8-year-old human boy and Sasha's owner. He believes that Charlie and Itchy are his guardian angels sent to get him back home safely. He replaces the role of Anne-Marie from the original film.\n* [[George Hearn]] as Red, a large beast-like demonic cat from Hell and the main antagonist. His goal is to imprison the dogs of Heaven, overthrow humanity, and permanently join Hell with the mortal world. To manipulate his victims, he disguises himself as a blinded elderly dog through his ability to transform (shapeshifting). \n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Annabelle, the archangel [[Whippet]] in Heaven. She summons Charlie and Itchy to retrieve [[Gabriel]]'s stolen Horn.\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Carface Caruthers, Charlie's arch-enemy, a [[Pit bull]]/[[bulldog]] mix, who becomes a henchman to Red through a deal between them. Contradictory to his aggressive personality in the original film, he appears quite slow-witted and timid in this film.\n\n;Supporting characters\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] MC, the duplicitous MC at Sasha's lounge.\n* [[Hamilton Camp]] as Gavin, a [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]. He waits for dogs especially a dog who puts on some weight to be healthy called Fluffy.\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Tall Customs Dog\n* [[Pat Corley]] as Officer McDowell\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Jingles, a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] who got kicked out of the sing-off, but was given the first place bone by Sasha.\n* [[Bobby Di Cicco]] as Tom, David's father.\n* Annette Helde as Claire, David's loving, [[pregnancy|pregnant]] step-mother.\n* Marabina Jaimes as Officer Reyes\n* [[Tony Jay]] as Reginald\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] as Lost & Found Officer\n* [[Steve Mackall]] as Short Customs Dog\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Ace the [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] / Officer Andrews\n\n==Production==\n[[David Feiss]] served as an in-house supervising animator, storyboard artist and character designer for the state-side production. Much of the film's animation was outsourced to foreign studios, such as [[Wang Film Productions]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] (from which Yang Chih Tsang was the directing animator) and its [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]-based division (from which Jov Huang and Shih-fu Liao were supervising animators), [[Phoenix Animation Studios|Phoenix Animation]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] (from which Julian Harris was the directing animator), [[A.

Produced by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Family Entertainment]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation]], it was co-directed by Paul Sabella and Larry Leker. [[Dom DeLuise]] reprises his role from the first film, alongside new cast members [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]], respectively. New characters are voiced by [[Sheena Easton]], [[Adam Wylie]] and [[George Hearn]].\n\n[[Don Bluth]], the director of the original film, had no involvement with it. It was the second of only two theatrical sequels to a film directed by [[Don Bluth]] to not involve Bluth himself, the first being ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', as 13  sequels to ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' and a single sequel to ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' were direct-to-video releases along with two sequels of ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1998\u20132000, as well as ''[[An All Dogs Christmas Carol]]''. This was [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s last theatrically released animated film until ''[[Igor (film)|Igor]]'' (2008). It had a DVD double feature release with the first one on March 14, 2006 and January 18, 2011. It was also released on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011.\n\nThe film also served as the series premiere for the ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\nDecades after [[All Dogs Go to Heaven|the events of the first movie]], Charlie B. Barkin ([[Charlie Sheen]]) welcomes his friend, Itchy ([[Dom DeLuise]]), to [[Heaven]], but states he is disillusioned by the afterlife. Their old nemesis, Carface Caruthers ([[Ernest Borgnine]]), steals [[Gabriel]]'s Horn, but loses it somewhere over [[San Francisco]] in his attempt to escape with it. The dog angels are alerted of the horn's theft by Anabelle, the head angel ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]), who sends Charlie and Itchy to Earth to retrieve it, and gives them one miracle to use. Upon arrival in San Francisco, they discover that they are [[ghost]]s, and therefore unable to interact with the physical world. At a tavern where Charlie flirts with a beautiful and charming [[Irish Setter]] named Sasha La Fleur ([[Sheena Easton]]), Carface appears in a [[Human body|corporeal]] form granted by a red dog collar created by Red ([[George Hearn]]), an elderly dog fortune teller who gives Charlie and Itchy equivalent collars effective for a single day. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to the duo, Red reveals his true form as a large [[demon]]ic [[cat]] who intends to take the horn for himself with Carface's help.\n\nCharlie and Itchy meet Sasha and an 8-year-old human boy she is looking after named David ([[Adam Wylie]]), who ran away from home to become a [[Street performance|street performer]] doing [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]], the former leading him to believe that he is his [[guardian angel]]. Before leaving for \"Easy Street\", Charlie uses his miracle in the form of a lustful kiss (which Sasha is disgusted by) to grant Sasha the ability to converse with David. Upon seeing the horn being taken into a police station, they rescue it, with Carface failing to steal it from them. Refusing to return to Heaven, Charlie hides it in a [[lobster trap]]. On Easy Street, they entertain an audience with magic tricks, but the act is ruined by a combination of a rainstorm and falling into a fountain. David finally reveals that he believes that his father and stepmother, who are expecting a new baby, will care less for him once it's born; but is persuaded otherwise by Charlie. As Charlie and Sasha share a tender moment, his collar vanishes, and he and Itchy become ghosts again.\n\nCarface then kidnaps David and demands that Charlie bring Gabriel's horn to [[Alcatraz Island]] and give it to Red in exchange for David's life. Determined to fulfill his promise to get David home, Charlie approaches Red, who presses him to give him the horn. He does so, and Red uses it to capture Heaven's canine angels (including Annabelle) and send them to Earth in the prison cells while opening a portal to permanently connect the human world to Hell. While Carface flees for cover, not wanting to get in Red's way - Charlie, Itchy, Sasha, and David stay to challenge Red and steal the horn which Charlie then plays to free the angels and send Red back to [[Hell]] which also seals the portal. Carface comes out of hiding and attempts to downplay his involvement. However, Red returns (briefly reopening the portal) and drags Carface into Hell, which reveals to everyone that Carface had unknowingly sold his soul to him in exchange for his collar.\n\nWith their mission accomplished, Charlie and Itchy are spirited away to Heaven; much to the upset of David and Sasha (who finally admits that she is in love with Charlie). Charlie gives the horn back to Anabelle in exchange for a new life and says yet another goodbye to Itchy, who decides to remain in Heaven. After he happily reunites with Sasha and David, they head to the latter's house where he returns and reconciles with his father and stepmother. His stepmother is relieved that he is alive and explains she has been worried about him and says just because she is pregnant does not mean she does not love him as well and that they are all a family. They then adopt Charlie and Sasha, and the two share a kiss, happy with their new life together.\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->\n\n==Voice cast== \n[[Burt Reynolds]], [[Vic Tayback]] and [[Melba Moore]] are replaced by [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]]; however, three characters were written out of the [[sequel]]. Anne-Marie was written out of the story due to the murder of [[Judith Barsi]] in July 25, 1988, while Killer and Flo were written out of the story because [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] and [[Loni Anderson]] chose not to return to their roles from the first film{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} (although Reilly returned for the third movie and the TV series).\n\n;Main characters\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Charles \"Charlie\" B. Barkin, a [[German Shepherd]] who returns from Heaven to find Gabriel's Horn. It is revealed that as a puppy, he ran away from home (which explains the absence of Charlie's parents, who were briefly shown in the original film in the records book in the song \"Let Me Be Surprised\"), a point he mentions to David to convince him to return home. Charlie Sheen replaced [[Burt Reynolds]] from the first film due to Reynolds participating in the 1996 films ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'', ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' and ''[[Mad Dog Time]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n** [[Jesse Corti]] as Charlie's singing voice. \n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Itchiford \"Itchy\" [[Dachshund]], Charlie's best friend.

He replaces the role of Anne-Marie from the original film.\n* [[George Hearn]] as Red, a large beast-like demonic cat from Hell and the main antagonist. His goal is to imprison the dogs of Heaven, overthrow humanity, and permanently join Hell with the mortal world. To manipulate his victims, he disguises himself as a blinded elderly dog through his ability to transform (shapeshifting). \n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Annabelle, the archangel [[Whippet]] in Heaven. She summons Charlie and Itchy to retrieve [[Gabriel]]'s stolen Horn.\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Carface Caruthers, Charlie's arch-enemy, a [[Pit bull]]/[[bulldog]] mix, who becomes a henchman to Red through a deal between them.
