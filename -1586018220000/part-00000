The countryside was largely Catholic, dominated by the ancient Catholic families: the Howards at Arundel, the Percys at Petworth House, the Gages at Firle, the Brownes (the Lords Montague) at Cowdray Park, the Palmers at Parham House, as well as other minor dynasties like the Carylls, Lewkenors, Shelleys and Kemps. At the start of Elizabeth's reign all six of Sussex's noble families were Catholic.<ref name=\"Phillips 2014 140\">{{harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014| p=140}}</ref> The towns, including Rye and Lewes, were more likely to be controlled by Protestants if not Protestant in orientation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimmock|Quinn|Hadfield|2013| p=41}}</ref> The Earl of Arundel, [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Henry FitzAlan]] had considerable influence as Lord Steward of the Royal Household, privy councillor and Lord Lieutenant of Sussex (1559-1569) until he was involved in the [[Ridolfi plot]] to marry his son-in-law, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, to Mary Queen of Scots.<ref name=\"Phillips 2014 140\"/> Even after the 1580s when restrictions on Catholics were imposed, Sussex continued to be led by Catholic peers. The office of sheriff of Sussex was held by Catholics eleven times between 1558 and 1603.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014| p=142}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of Elizabeth's reign, Catholicism continued to be tolerated. On the death of her husband, [[Magdalen Dacre|Lady Montague]] withdrew to Battle Abbey, the family's seat in the east of the county. The establishment of what became known as \"Little Rome\" became a focal point for the local Catholic community, with as many as 120 people attending Mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimmock|Quinn|Hadfield|2013| p=8}}</ref> This shows that long-standing political loyalty by Catholics was repaid by a form of toleration.\n\nThe Catholic Sussex families which suffered imprisonment or financial ruin at this time were mostly those that were involved in conspiracies against Elizabeth. After the uprising of 1569, the [[Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland|eighth Earl of Northumberland]] was effectively sent into internal exile in Sussex, at his home at [[Petworth House]]. After 1577, central authorities mounted on a growing attack on Catholic [[recusant]]s, forcing them to abandon apparent conformity at a greater cost.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} Fines for non-attendance at an Anglican church were increased from 12d per week to 20 pounds per month. In 1580 leading Sussex Catholics including [[John Gage (Tudor politician)|John Gage]] of Firle and [[Richard Shelley]] of Warminghurst were imprisoned for recusancy and continued to pay the taxes and fines demanded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| pp=84\u201385}}</ref> In 1583 [[Charles Paget (conspirator)|Charles Paget]] was smuggled into England, meeting William Shelley at Patching to discuss a plan to land Spanish, German and Italian troops in Sussex and march to Petworth House, the home of Northumberland, and Arundel Castle, while a second force would land in Lancashire and be joined by an uprising of English Catholics. Shelley's and Northumberland's actions reveal there was some truth in the suspicions directed against Sussex Catholics.\n\nWith further legislation in the 1580s, Sussex Catholics caught harbouring priests were guilty of treason. Significantly, no member of the Sussex gentry or nobility was ever charged under these laws, and neither was there ever any uprising, even though there was a significant Catholic community in Sussex. In this, the west of Sussex was out of step with the rest of England, just as attempts to impose a \"Godly magistracy\" in Rye in the east of the county was out of step with the rest of Protestant England.<ref name=\"Dimmock 2013 10\">{{harvnb|Dimmock|Quinn|Hadfield|2013| p=10}}</ref> During this period Sussex was often different{{clarify|date=August 2015}} from the rest of England, with east and west of the county often inversions of each other.<ref name=\"Dimmock 2013 10\"/> West Grinstead Park, home of the Caryll family, became a Roman Catholic mission where priests arrived, generally at night up the River Adur to await \"posting\".<ref name=\"harvnb|Brandon|2008\">{{harvnb|Brandon|2008|}}</ref><ref name=\"Conso\"/> he River Adur was extensively used by the many Catholics travelling covertly between London and the Continent.<ref name=\"Conso\"/> [[Thomas Pilchard]] was executed in 1587 for being a priest and Edward Shelley of Warminghurst died at Tyburn in London in 1588 for hiding a priest.<ref name=\"Lowerson 1980 85\">{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| p=85}}</ref> In 1588 two Catholic priests, [[Ralph Crockett]] and [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]], were arrested at Arundel Haven (now Littlehampton), taken to London and executed outside Chichester.<ref name=\"Lowerson 1980 85\"/> [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel]], who was canonised in 1970 as one of the [[Forty Martyrs of England and Wales]], spent much of his life at his family home of [[Arundel Castle]].

In Brighton the Anglican church became influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], to an extent unparalleled elsewhere in the country apart from [[London]].<ref>John Hawes (1995) ''Ritual and Riot''</ref>  In Anglo-Catholic circles, Brighton became associated with London, as in the collective title of ''\"London-Brighton and South Coast Religion\",''<ref>W.

In addition to the existing archdeaconries of Chichester and Lewes that date from the 12th century, a third [[archdeacon of Hastings|archdeaconry of Hastings]] was created.  This structure remained in place until the archdeaconries were reorganised under Eric Kemp in 1975.  The archdeaconry of Hastings was dissolved and merged back into the archdeaconry of Lewes, which was renamed the archdeaconry of Lewes and Hastings.  A new archdeaconry was created in the north of the county - the [[archdeacon of Horsham|archdeaconry of Horsham]].<ref name=\"diochi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chichester.anglican.org/|publisher= Diocese of Chichester|title=Chichester Diocese Website|accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"kemp186\">{{Cite book|author=Kemp, Eric|year=2006|title=Shy but not Retiring: the memoirs of Eric Kemp|others= Jeremy Haselock |publisher=Continuum|location=London|page=186|isbn= 978-0-8264-8073-6}}</ref>  This structure remained until 2014 when the archdeaconry of Hastings was recreated in the east of the county and the archeaconry of Lewes and Hastings was renamed the archdeaconry of Brighton and Lewes.  The suffragan [[Bishop of Horsham]] oversees the archdeaconries of Chichester and Horsham, while the suffragan [[Bishop of Lewes]] oversees the archdeaconries of Brighton & Lewes and Hastings.  The bishop of Chichester retains oversight over the entire diocese of Chichester i.e. all of Sussex.\n\nOn 16 November 2001, Pat Sinton, became the first woman priest in Sussex to be ordained.  Sinton was ordained by [[John Hind (bishop of Chichester)|John Hind]], the bishop of Chichester, following the departure of the previous bishop of Chichester, Eric Kemp.  Although Kemp had encouraged women to serve in the permanent diaconate in his diocese he had been an opponent of the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican communion|ordination of women to the priesthood]] and women priests were not licensed in the Diocese of Chichester during his episcopate.  In September 2014 [[Fiona Windsor]] was made [[archdeacon of Horsham]], making her the first female archdeacon in Sussex.  \nThe Church of England in Sussex was damaged by [[Diocese of Chichester#Child abuse|sexual abuse scandals]] in the early 2000s.\n\n====Roman Catholic Church====\nIn 1900 the Roman Catholic nun [[Maude Petre]] began a friendship with the [[Jesuit]] priest [[George Tyrell]],<ref>Ivana Noble.

Both Petre and Tyrell were major figures in the [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist controversy]] of the early 20th century.  The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton]] was formed in 1965 out of part of the diocese of Southwark.  It includes Sussex and Surrey.

The countryside was largely Catholic, dominated by the ancient Catholic families: the Howards at Arundel, the Percys at Petworth House, the Gages at Firle, the Brownes (the Lords Montague) at Cowdray Park, the Palmers at Parham House, as well as other minor dynasties like the Carylls, Lewkenors, Shelleys and Kemps. At the start of Elizabeth's reign all six of Sussex's noble families were Catholic.<ref name=\"Phillips 2014 140\">{{harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014| p=140}}</ref> The towns, including Rye and Lewes, were more likely to be controlled by Protestants if not Protestant in orientation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimmock|Quinn|Hadfield|2013| p=41}}</ref> The Earl of Arundel, [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Henry FitzAlan]] had considerable influence as Lord Steward of the Royal Household, privy councillor and Lord Lieutenant of Sussex (1559-1569) until he was involved in the [[Ridolfi plot]] to marry his son-in-law, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, to Mary Queen of Scots.<ref name=\"Phillips 2014 140\"/> Even after the 1580s when restrictions on Catholics were imposed, Sussex continued to be led by Catholic peers. The office of sheriff of Sussex was held by Catholics eleven times between 1558 and 1603.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|Smith|2014| p=142}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of Elizabeth's reign, Catholicism continued to be tolerated. On the death of her husband, [[Magdalen Dacre|Lady Montague]] withdrew to Battle Abbey, the family's seat in the east of the county. The establishment of what became known as \"Little Rome\" became a focal point for the local Catholic community, with as many as 120 people attending Mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Dimmock|Quinn|Hadfield|2013| p=8}}</ref> This shows that long-standing political loyalty by Catholics was repaid by a form of toleration.\n\nThe Catholic Sussex families which suffered imprisonment or financial ruin at this time were mostly those that were involved in conspiracies against Elizabeth. After the uprising of 1569, the [[Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland|eighth Earl of Northumberland]] was effectively sent into internal exile in Sussex, at his home at [[Petworth House]]. After 1577, central authorities mounted on a growing attack on Catholic [[recusant]]s, forcing them to abandon apparent conformity at a greater cost.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} Fines for non-attendance at an Anglican church were increased from 12d per week to 20 pounds per month. In 1580 leading Sussex Catholics including [[John Gage (Tudor politician)|John Gage]] of Firle and [[Richard Shelley]] of Warminghurst were imprisoned for recusancy and continued to pay the taxes and fines demanded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| pp=84\u201385}}</ref> In 1583 [[Charles Paget (conspirator)|Charles Paget]] was smuggled into England, meeting William Shelley at Patching to discuss a plan to land Spanish, German and Italian troops in Sussex and march to Petworth House, the home of Northumberland, and Arundel Castle, while a second force would land in Lancashire and be joined by an uprising of English Catholics. Shelley's and Northumberland's actions reveal there was some truth in the suspicions directed against Sussex Catholics.\n\nWith further legislation in the 1580s, Sussex Catholics caught harbouring priests were guilty of treason. Significantly, no member of the Sussex gentry or nobility was ever charged under these laws, and neither was there ever any uprising, even though there was a significant Catholic community in Sussex. In this, the west of Sussex was out of step with the rest of England, just as attempts to impose a \"Godly magistracy\" in Rye in the east of the county was out of step with the rest of Protestant England.<ref name=\"Dimmock 2013 10\">{{harvnb|Dimmock|Quinn|Hadfield|2013| p=10}}</ref> During this period Sussex was often different{{clarify|date=August 2015}} from the rest of England, with east and west of the county often inversions of each other.<ref name=\"Dimmock 2013 10\"/> West Grinstead Park, home of the Caryll family, became a Roman Catholic mission where priests arrived, generally at night up the River Adur to await \"posting\".<ref name=\"harvnb|Brandon|2008\">{{harvnb|Brandon|2008|}}</ref><ref name=\"Conso\"/> he River Adur was extensively used by the many Catholics travelling covertly between London and the Continent.<ref name=\"Conso\"/> [[Thomas Pilchard]] was executed in 1587 for being a priest and Edward Shelley of Warminghurst died at Tyburn in London in 1588 for hiding a priest.<ref name=\"Lowerson 1980 85\">{{harvnb|Lowerson|1980| p=85}}</ref> In 1588 two Catholic priests, [[Ralph Crockett]] and [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]], were arrested at Arundel Haven (now Littlehampton), taken to London and executed outside Chichester.<ref name=\"Lowerson 1980 85\"/> [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel]], who was canonised in 1970 as one of the [[Forty Martyrs of England and Wales]], spent much of his life at his family home of [[Arundel Castle]].

In Brighton the Anglican church became influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], to an extent unparalleled elsewhere in the country apart from [[London]].<ref>John Hawes (1995) ''Ritual and Riot''</ref>  In Anglo-Catholic circles, Brighton became associated with London, as in the collective title of ''\"London-Brighton and South Coast Religion\",''<ref>W.

The railway, coincidentally or otherwise, linked all the large and growing centres of Anglo-Catholic worship spreading from London to Brighton and then east and west along coast of [[Sussex]] to the neighbouring counties of [[Kent]] and [[Hampshire]]. [[Anglo-Catholic]] priests in Brighton, included [[Henry Michell Wagner]] whose churches included [[St Paul's Church, Brighton|St Paul's Church]] and there was a powerful Protestant reaction including a riot in 1880.<ref name=\"Wickins 2012 39\">{{harvnb|Wickins|2012|pp=39}}</ref> Brighton vicar Rev [[John Purchas]] was charged and [[Ritualism in the Church of England|ritualism]] spread to churches in [[Christ Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|Hastings]] and [[St Andrew's Church, Worthing|Worthing]].

In addition to the existing archdeaconries of Chichester and Lewes that date from the 12th century, a third [[archdeacon of Hastings|archdeaconry of Hastings]] was created.  This structure remained in place until the archdeaconries were reorganised under Eric Kemp in 1975.  The archdeaconry of Hastings was dissolved and merged back into the archdeaconry of Lewes, which was renamed the archdeaconry of Lewes and Hastings.  A new archdeaconry was created in the north of the county - the [[archdeacon of Horsham|archdeaconry of Horsham]].<ref name=\"diochi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chichester.anglican.org/|publisher= Diocese of Chichester|title=Chichester Diocese Website|accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"kemp186\">{{Cite book|author=Kemp, Eric|year=2006|title=Shy but not Retiring: the memoirs of Eric Kemp|others= Jeremy Haselock |publisher=Continuum|location=London|page=186|isbn= 978-0-8264-8073-6}}</ref>  This structure remained until 2014 when the archdeaconry of Hastings was recreated in the east of the county and the archeaconry of Lewes and Hastings was renamed the archdeaconry of Brighton and Lewes.  The suffragan [[Bishop of Horsham]] oversees the archdeaconries of Chichester and Horsham, while the suffragan [[Bishop of Lewes]] oversees the archdeaconries of Brighton & Lewes and Hastings.  The bishop of Chichester retains oversight over the entire diocese of Chichester i.e. all of Sussex.\n\nOn 16 November 2001, Pat Sinton, became the first woman priest in Sussex to be ordained.  Sinton was ordained by [[John Hind (bishop of Chichester)|John Hind]], the bishop of Chichester, following the departure of the previous bishop of Chichester, Eric Kemp.  Although Kemp had encouraged women to serve in the permanent diaconate in his diocese he had been an opponent of the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican communion|ordination of women to the priesthood]] and women priests were not licensed in the Diocese of Chichester during his episcopate.  In September 2014 [[Fiona Windsor]] was made [[archdeacon of Horsham]], making her the first female archdeacon in Sussex.  \nThe Church of England in Sussex was damaged by [[Diocese of Chichester#Child abuse|sexual abuse scandals]] in the early 2000s.\n\n====Roman Catholic Church====\nIn 1900 the Roman Catholic nun [[Maude Petre]] began a friendship with the [[Jesuit]] priest [[George Tyrell]],<ref>Ivana Noble.

Both Petre and Tyrell were major figures in the [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist controversy]] of the early 20th century.  The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton]] was formed in 1965 out of part of the diocese of Southwark.  It includes Sussex and Surrey.  In the early 2000s, the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Arundel and Brighton diocese|sexual abuse scandal in the Arundel and Brighton diocese]] hurt the public's trust in the work of local diocesan officials.\n\n====Relations with Sussex churches====\nAppointed as Bishop of Chichester in 1929, [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]] was a vocal supporter of the German resistance to Nazism and a pioneer of the [[Ecumenical Movement]] that aimed for greater co-operation between churches.  Bell established in 1955 the first ever County Council of Churches in Sussex, since which similar structures have been formed in other parts of England.<ref name=\"CTSx\">{{cite web|url=http://together.ourchurchweb.org.uk/sussex/about/about/|publisher=[[Churches Together in England]]|title=About Churches Together in Sussex|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>  \n\nThere is a history of religious antagonism and anti-popery around the bonfire celebrations in Lewes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}</ref>  In the 1930s the mayor of Lewes requested that 'no popery' banners be removed and an end to the burning of effigies of Pope Paul V.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}</ref>  In the 1950s the Cliffe Bonfire Society was banned from the Bonfire Council from taking part in the United Grand Procession for its refusal to stop carrying a 'no popery' banner and banners commemorating the 16th century Protestant martyrs burned at Lewes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}</ref>  In Lewes, women were to a significant degree responsible for using the spirit of ecunemism to build bridges between the denominations that had until then continued to be anti-Catholic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goring|2003|pp=157, 169.}}</ref>   In 1984 Sussex church leaders were invited to Lewes to discuss Protestant-Catholic relations.

In early 1985 it organized a march of over 200,000 famine victims from Tigray to Sudan to draw international attention to the plight of Tigray. Its humanitarian branch, the [[Relief Society of Tigray]] (REST), established in 1978, received large amounts of international humanitarian aid for famine victims and small-scale development projects in liberated Tigray.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn July 1985 a congress of a few hundred selected cadres established the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist League of Tigray|Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray]] (MLLT). The MLLT was conceived to be the nucleus of the future [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Leninst]] vanguard part for the whole of Ethiopia.

In spring 1989 first the MLLT and then the TPLF held a congress. Abbay was elected Chairman of both but towards the end of 1989 Meles became the chairman of both organizations. In May 1989 the EPDM established the Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Force (EMLF). In July 1989 MLLT and EMLF created the Union of Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations. In April 1990 the TPLF formed the Ethiopian Democratic Officers Movement from politically re-educated captured Ethiopian officers to undercut the Free Officers Movement formed in 1987 by exiled Ethiopian officers in opposition to the ''Derg''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Generation: The history of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, Part 2: Ethiopia-Transformation and Conflict|last=Tadesse|first=Kiflu|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=}}</ref> In May 1990 Oromo-members of the EPDM and politically re-educated Oromo-Prisoners-of-War founded the [[Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization|Oromo People's Democratic Organization]] (OPDO) to deny the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] the claim to be the exclusive representative of the Ethiopian Oromo.<ref name=\":1\" /> In November 1990 an Oromo Marxist-Leninist Movement was established within the OPDO. Also in 1990 the TPLF created the Afar Democratic Union to undercut the Afar movements. Before 1985 it had already helped to establish liberation fronts in Gambella and Benshangul.\n\nIn early 1988 both the EPLF and the TPLF went on the offensive. The developing situation in both Eritrea and Tigray but also the shifting international context after the demise of the Soviet bloc induced the TPLF and EPLF to put their differences aside and to resume military cooperation.

When on 28 May 1991 the EPRDF entered Addis Ababa and took power as the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]], the TPLF had 80,000, the EPDM 8,000 and the OPDO 2,000 fighters.

It declared its struggle to be the second ''w\u00e4yyan\u00e4'' (''kalay w\u00e4yyan\u00e4'') and changed its Tigrinya name to ''H\u0259zbayawi W\u00e4yyan\u00e4 Har\u0259nn\u00e4t\u00e4 T\u0259gray''. It adopted a new political program calling for self-determination within a democratic Ethiopia with independence as an option only if unity proved to be impossible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The National Movement in Tigray Myths and Realities|last=Berhe|first=Kahsay|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=M\u00fcnster|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn retrospect however, it is apparent that the 1978-85 period further strengthened the TPLF. The ''Derg''<nowiki/>'s increasingly alienating intervention, the Front's handling of the famine and of the refugee problems, as well as the foreign connections it built through its mission in [[Khartoum]], all enabled the movement to mobilize and better equip more fighters and prepare for a change from guerrilla to frontal battles. Also, in the mid-1980s, developments within the TPLF led to a conceptual change from a struggle for the liberation of Tigray to that of all of Ethiopia.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Sweeter than Honey: Testimonies of Tigrayan Women|last=Hammond|first=Jenny|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref> They established their headquarters in caves in [[Addi Geza'iti]], some 50 kilometres west of [[Mekelle]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smidt |first1=W |title=Geo-trekking in Ethiopia's Tropical Mountains |chapter=A Short History and Ethnography of the Tembien Tigrayans |series=GeoGuide |date=2019 |publisher=Springer Nature |pages=63\u201378 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04955-3_4 |isbn=978-3-030-04954-6 }}</ref> The allied [[EPDM]] party used caves in [[Melfa (Dogu'a Tembien)]].\n[[File:Signboard for Melfa headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|Signboard for EPDM/ANLF headquarters in [[Melfa (Dogu'a Tembien)]] during the [[Ethiopian Civil War]]]]\n\nThe TPLF succeeded in turning the catastrophic famine 1984-85 to its overall advantage. In early 1985 it organized a march of over 200,000 famine victims from Tigray to Sudan to draw international attention to the plight of Tigray. Its humanitarian branch, the [[Relief Society of Tigray]] (REST), established in 1978, received large amounts of international humanitarian aid for famine victims and small-scale development projects in liberated Tigray.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn July 1985 a congress of a few hundred selected cadres established the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist League of Tigray|Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray]] (MLLT). The MLLT was conceived to be the nucleus of the future [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Leninst]] vanguard part for the whole of Ethiopia. The MLLT invited the genuine revolutionaries within the ranks of ''Derg'' regime, which was then busy [[Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia|organizing its own communist party]], the [[Ethiopian Workers' Party]], to join it.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAfter the congress, the TPLF and its mass organizations were ruthlessly brought under the control of the MLLT, dissenting cadres among them TPLF-co-founders Gidey and Berhu, were purged.\n\nIn December 1988 the TPLF and [[Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (EPDM, a TPLF-loyal splinter group from the EPRP, founded in 1980) founded the EPRDF as the nucleus of the envisaged United Democratic Front. In spring 1989 first the MLLT and then the TPLF held a congress. Abbay was elected Chairman of both but towards the end of 1989 Meles became the chairman of both organizations. In May 1989 the EPDM established the Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Force (EMLF). In July 1989 MLLT and EMLF created the Union of Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations. In April 1990 the TPLF formed the Ethiopian Democratic Officers Movement from politically re-educated captured Ethiopian officers to undercut the Free Officers Movement formed in 1987 by exiled Ethiopian officers in opposition to the ''Derg''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Generation: The history of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, Part 2: Ethiopia-Transformation and Conflict|last=Tadesse|first=Kiflu|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=}}</ref> In May 1990 Oromo-members of the EPDM and politically re-educated Oromo-Prisoners-of-War founded the [[Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization|Oromo People's Democratic Organization]] (OPDO) to deny the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] the claim to be the exclusive representative of the Ethiopian Oromo.<ref name=\":1\" /> In November 1990 an Oromo Marxist-Leninist Movement was established within the OPDO. Also in 1990 the TPLF created the Afar Democratic Union to undercut the Afar movements. Before 1985 it had already helped to establish liberation fronts in Gambella and Benshangul.\n\nIn early 1988 both the EPLF and the TPLF went on the offensive. The developing situation in both Eritrea and Tigray but also the shifting international context after the demise of the Soviet bloc induced the TPLF and EPLF to put their differences aside and to resume military cooperation. In 1989 the EPRDF formed a shadow government of Ethiopia administering the liberated areas under its control.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== 1991\u2013present ===\nReflecting the changed international context after the [[Revolutions of 1989|demise of Soviet communism]] by 1990 the TPLF internationally avoided references to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. In February 1991 the EPRDF launched its final offensive against the ''[[PDRE]]'' regime assisted by a large EPLF contingent. When on 28 May 1991 the EPRDF entered Addis Ababa and took power as the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]], the TPLF had 80,000, the EPDM 8,000 and the OPDO 2,000 fighters. The total number of TPLF-members was well beyond 100,000.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReacting to the international political context after the [[Fall of the Soviet Union|demise of the Soviet Union]] the EPRDF/TPLF dropped all Marxist references in its political discourse, adopted a program of change based on [[Multi-party system|multi-party politics]], [[constitutional democracy]], [[Ethnofederalism|ethno-linguistic federalization]] and a [[mixed economy]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn November 2019, Prime Minister [[Abiy Ahmed]] and Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front Chairman unified the constituent parties of the coalition into a new [[Prosperity Party]].

When accessing the Internet via a captive portal, Firefox will alert users and open the portal login page in a new tab.\n* Enabled multi-process Firefox for Windows users with touch screens\n* Added user warnings for non-secure HTTP pages with logins. Firefox now displays a \u201cThis connection is not secure\u201d message when users click into the username and password fields on pages that don't use HTTPS.\n* Implemented the Strict Secure Cookies specification which forbids insecure HTTP sites from setting cookies with the \"secure\" attribute. In some cases, this will prevent an insecure site from setting a cookie with the same name as an existing \"secure\" cookie from the same base domain.\n* Enhanced Sync to allow users to send and open tabs from one device to another.\n* Improved text input for third-party keyboard layouts on Windows. This will address some keyboard layouts that:\n** have chained dead keys.\n** input two or more characters with a non-printable key or a dead key sequence.\n** input a character even when a dead key sequence failed to compose a character.\n* Removed support for Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI) plugins other than Flash. Silverlight, Java, Acrobat and the like are no longer supported.\n* Removed Battery Status API to reduce fingerprinting of users by trackers.\n* Improved experience for downloads:\n** Notification in the toolbar when a download fails.\n** Quick access to five most recent downloads rather than three.\n** Larger buttons for canceling and restarting downloads.\n* Displaying (but allowing users to override) an \u201cUntrusted Connection\u201d error when encountering SHA-1 certificates that chain up to a root certificate included in Mozilla's CA Certificate Program. (Note: Firefox continues to permit SHA-1 certificates that chain to manually imported root certificates.)\n* Migrated Firefox users on Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems to the extended support release (ESR) version of Firefox.\n* When not using Direct2D on Windows, Skia is used for content rendering.\n* Enabled CSS Grid Layout, opening up a world of new possibilities for graphic design.\n* Redesigned Responsive Design Mode to include device selection, network throttling, and more.\n* Improved security for screen sharing, which now shows a preview and no longer requires a whitelisted domain.\n'''Android'''\n* Reduced APK file size by more than 5 MB for faster download and installation.\n* Display of media controls to pause or resume playback on the Android notification bar. This gives users easy access to controls and allows them to see when audio or video is playing (and consuming mobile data) on Firefox.\n|-\n\n| 52.0.1\n| March 17, 2017\n| ''Off-cycle security

When accessing the Internet via a captive portal, Firefox will alert users and open the portal login page in a new tab.\n* Enabled multi-process Firefox for Windows users with touch screens\n* Added user warnings for non-secure HTTP pages with logins. Firefox now displays a \u201cThis connection is not secure\u201d message when users click into the username and password fields on pages that don't use HTTPS.\n* Implemented the Strict Secure Cookies specification which forbids insecure HTTP sites from setting cookies with the \"secure\" attribute. In some cases, this will prevent an insecure site from setting a cookie with the same name as an existing \"secure\" cookie from the same base domain.\n* Enhanced Sync to allow users to send and open tabs from one device to another.\n* Improved text input for third-party keyboard layouts on Windows. This will address some keyboard layouts that:\n** have chained dead keys.\n** input two or more characters with a non-printable key or a dead key sequence.\n** input a character even when a dead key sequence failed to compose a character.\n* Removed support for Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI) plugins other than Flash. Silverlight, Java, Acrobat and the like are no longer supported.\n* Removed Battery Status API to reduce fingerprinting of users by trackers.\n* Improved experience for downloads:\n** Notification in the toolbar when a download fails.\n** Quick access to five most recent downloads rather than three.\n** Larger buttons for canceling and restarting downloads.\n* Displaying (but allowing users to override) an \u201cUntrusted Connection\u201d error when encountering SHA-1 certificates that chain up to a root certificate included in Mozilla's CA Certificate Program. (Note: Firefox continues to permit SHA-1 certificates that chain to manually imported root certificates.)\n* Migrated Firefox users on Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems to the extended support release (ESR) version of Firefox.\n* When not using Direct2D on Windows, Skia is used for content rendering.\n* Enabled CSS Grid Layout, opening up a world of new possibilities for graphic design.\n* Redesigned Responsive Design Mode to include device selection, network throttling, and more.\n* Improved security for screen sharing, which now shows a preview and no longer requires a whitelisted domain.\n'''Android'''\n* Reduced APK file size by more than 5 MB for faster download and installation.\n* Display of media controls to pause or resume playback on the Android notification bar. This gives users easy access to controls and allows them to see when audio or video is playing (and consuming mobile data) on Firefox.\n|-\n\n| 52.0.1\n| March 17, 2017\n| ''Off-cycle security
