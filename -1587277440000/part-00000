Launched in 1902 by [[Temple Press]] as an offshoot of Motor magazine, it was withdrawn after a few months but relaunched in 1909. The Motor Cycle, which was launched by Iliffe in April 1903, coined the slogan on its masthead: \"Established in 1903 and for over six years the only paper soley devoted to the pastime\".<ref>\n[http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/?location_id=414&item=10] National Motor Museum, Retrieved 25 March 2013</ref> the front covers often had varying degree of green background, green or contrasting text and B&W illustrations or photographic images. This common theme resulted in almost a '[[trademark look|trademark]]' appearance, being called \"The Green 'un\", distinguishing it from its rival publication ''[[The Motor Cycle (magazine)|The Motor Cycle]]'' which had variation on blue background colouring with contrasting text and images (\"The Blue 'un\").\n\n==Early years==\nThe editor from 1938, [[Graham Walker (motorcycle racer)|Graham Walker]], was a [[dispatch rider]] in the First World War and had a successful racing career with [[Rudge-Whitworth|Rudge]], [[Sunbeam Cycles|Sunbeam]], and [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]], winning the [[Ulster Grand Prix]] in 1928.<ref name=natarch>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=307-walker&cid=-1&Gsm=2008-06-18 National Archives] 18 June 2008.</ref> He rode many times in the [[Isle of Man TT]], winning the lightweight (250cc) class in 1931,<ref>[http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/Events.aspx?meet_code=TT31%20%20&era=2 Events]</ref> and became president of the TT Riders Association.<ref>[http://www.ttra.co.uk/ttraabout.htm TTRA About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512000121/http://www.ttra.co.uk/ttraabout.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref> He was also the father of racing commentator [[Murray Walker]]. \n\nMany issues throughout the 1940s and 1950s had the [[strapline]] \"Read wherever motorcycles are ridden!\"\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Motor Cycling 2nd April 1959.JPG|thumb|upright|''Motor Cycling with Scooter Weekly'', 2 April 1959]]\nIn 1959 it became ''Motor Cycling with Scooter Weekly''.

It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]].

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

It stands out as one of the first French cities, after [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], to have entered an era of [[urbanism]] and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first [[Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur]] then the Marquis de Tourny.\n\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the [[World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France]].\n\n=== Buildings ===\n\nMain sights include:\n* ''[[Place de la Bourse]]'' (1735\u20131755), designed by the Royal architect [[Jacques Gabriel]] as landscape for an [[equestrian statue]] of Louis XV, now replaced by the ''Fountain of the Three Graces''.\n* ''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre]]'' (1780), a large neoclassical theater built in the 18th century.\n* ''All\u00e9es de Tourny''\n* ''Cours de l'Intendance''\n* ''Place du Chapelet''\n* ''Place du Parlement''\n* ''[[Place des Quinconces]]'', the largest square in France.\n* ''Monument aux Girondins''\n* ''Place Saint-Pierre''\n*''[[Pont de pierre (Bordeaux)|Pont de pierre]] (1822)''\n* ''Saint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral'', consecrated by [[Pope Urban II]] in 1096. Of the original Romanesque edifice only a wall in the nave remains. The Royal Gate is from the early 13th century, while the rest of the construction is mostly from the 14th and 15th centuries.\n* ''[[Tour Pey-Berland]]'' (1440\u20131450), a massive, quadrangular Gothic tower annexed to the cathedral.\n* ''[[\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix]]'' (Church of the Holy Cross). It lies on the site of a 7th-century abbey destroyed by the Saracens. Rebuilt under the Carolingians, it was again destroyed by the Normans in 845 and 864. It is annexed to a Benedictine abbey founded in the 7th century, and was built in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The fa\u00e7ade is in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]\n* The Gothic ''[[Basilica of St. Michael, Bordeaux|Basilica of Saint Michael]]'', constructed between the end of the 14th century and the 16th century.\n* [[Basilica of Saint Severinus of Bordeaux|Basilica of Saint Severinus]], the most ancient church in Bordeaux. It was built in the early 6th century on the site of a palaeochristian necropolis. It has an 11th-century [[portico]], while the [[apse]] and [[transept]] are from the following century. The 13th-century nave has chapels from the 11th and the 14th centuries.

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Anthony Frederick Sandys - Queen Eleanor.JPG|[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n=== Major companies ===\n\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n[[File:Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac.jpg|250px|thumb|Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac]]\n*[[Arena (swimwear)|Arena]]\n*[[Groupe Bernard]]\n*[[Groupe Castel]]\n*[[Cdiscount]]\n*[[Dassault Group|Dassault]]\n*[[Jock (company)|Jock]]\n*[[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]]\n*[[McKesson Corporation]]\n*[[Oxbow (surfwear)|Oxbow]]\n*[[Pernod Ricard|Ricard]]\n*[[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi Aventis]]\n*[[Smurfit Kappa]]\n*[[Snecma|SNECMA]]\n*[[Solectron]]\n*[[Thales Group]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Population ==\n\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%.

These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Anthony Frederick Sandys - Queen Eleanor.JPG|[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

The wholesaler will accept a slightly lower sales price for each unit, if the retailer will agree to purchase a much greater quantity of units, so the wholesaler can maximize profit.  A wholesaler usually represents a factory where goods are produced.  The factory owners can use [[economy of scale]] to increase profit as quantities sold soars.\n\n[[Retailing]] is [[buying]] goods in a wholesale market https//weekooo.com to sell them in small quantities at higher prices to [[consumers]].  Part of this profit is justified by [[logistics]], the useful distribution function of the retailer, who delivers the goods to consumers and divides those large quantities of goods into many smaller units suitable for many transactions with many small parties of consumers.  Retailers can also benefit from [[economy of scale]] to increase profit, just like a wholesaler does.\n\n'''Bulk purchasing''' is when a consumer captures part of the benefits of [[economy of scale]] by doing with the retailer what the retailer does with the wholesaler: paying a lower price per unit in exchange for purchasing much larger quantities.  This allows the consumer to satisfy more of his or her demands at a lower total cost by acquiring more [[use value]] per dollar spent.\n\nConsumer demand for savings by bulk purchase has led to the success of [[big-box store]]s.

W. Golding, a British power engineer and authority on wind energy generation.<ref name=Wind_Energy/> Convinced of the potential of wind power in India, he recommended continued and extensive wind velocity surveys in different regions of India, the full-time assignment of staff to experimental wind power studies, the establishment of a dedicated research laboratory and development of small to medium-sized wind-powered electrical generators. Golding's recommendations were adopted by the CSIR in 1957.<ref name=Wind_Energy/> By this time, regions of [[Saurashtra (state)|Saurashtra]] and around [[Coimbatore]] had been identified as promising sites for generating electricity from wind power, and the Wind Power Sub-Committee had begun to erect 20 wind velocity survey stations across India, in addition to testing its indigenously designed windmills and obtaining a 6 kw. [[Allgaier (company)|Allgaier]] wind turbine, which was presented to India by the West German government; experiments at [[Porbandar]] with the latter had commenced by 1961.<ref name=Wind_Power/><ref name=Wind_Energy/> The Indian government also considered a proposal to erect over 20,000 small to medium-sized wind-powered electrical generators in rural districts, to be used for powering water pumps and supplying electricity for remotely situated structures such as lighthouses.<ref name=Wind_Power/>\n\nIn 1960, the CSIR established a Wind Power Division as part of the new National Aeronautical Laboratory (NAL) in Bangalore, which was founded that year.<ref name=Wind_Energy/> From the 1960s into the 1980s, the NAL and other groups continued to carry out wind velocity surveys and develop improved estimates of India's wind energy capacity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mani |first=Anna |date=1995 |title=Wind Energy Resource Survey in India - I |url= |location=New Delhi |publisher=Allied Publishers Limited |page=185 |isbn=81-7023-297-X |author-link= }}</ref> Large-scale development of wind power began in 1985 with the first wind project in Veraval, Gujarat, in the form of a 40-kW Dutch machine (make Polenko) connected to the grid.  The project, an initiative of late Dr. K S Rao, the then Director of GEDA (Gujarat Energy Development Agency), was a joint venture between GEDA and J K Synthetics Ltd. Though the performance of this machine was quite poor, it established the technical viability of operating wind turbines in the grid-connected mode in India. Subsequently, the Government of India planned several demonstration wind farms in the coastal regions of the country and simultaneously launched a massive programme to identify sites suitable for wind projects. In 1986, demonstration [[wind farm]]s were set up in the coastal areas of [[Maharashtra]] ([[Ratnagiri district|Ratnagiri]]), [[Gujarat]] ([[Okha, India|Okha]]) and [[Tamil Nadu]] ([[Tirunelveli]]) with 55&nbsp;kW Vestas wind turbines. These demonstration projects were supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|(MNRE]]). The demonstration projects set up in 1985-86 established beyond doubt, both the technical and economic viability of the wind energy projects, while the wind-mapping programme resulted in the identification of many sites suitable for wind power projects (C-WET 2001; Mani 1990, 1992, 1994; Mani and Mooley 1983).\n\nThe potential for wind farms in the country was first assessed in 2011 to be more than 2,000 GW by Prof. Jami Hossain of TERI University, New Delhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251627585_A_GIS_based_assessment_of_potential_for_windfarms_in_India|title=A GIS based assessment of potential for windfarms in India}}</ref>\nThis was subsequently re-validated by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, US (LBNL) in an independent study in 2012. \nAs a result, the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|MNRE]] set up a committee to reassess the potential<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283356238_Report_on_India's_Wind_Power_Potential|title=India Wind Power Potential}}</ref> and through the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE, previously C-WET) has announced a revised estimation of the potential wind resource in India from 49,130 MW to 302,000 MW assessed at 100&nbsp;m hub height.<ref name=\"states\">{{cite web|url=http://niwe.res.in/department_wra_est.php|title=Estimation of Installable Wind Power Potential at 80 m level in India|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> Wind turbines are now being set up at even 120 m hub height and the wind resource at higher hub heights of around 120 m or more that are prevailing is possibly even more. \n\nIn 2015, the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|MNRE]] set the target for Wind Power generation capacity by the year 2022 at 60,000 MW.<ref name=\"nre\">{{cite web|url=https://mnre.gov.in/the-ministry/physical-progress|title=Physical Progress (Achievements)|publisher=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, GoI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/Tentative-State-wise-break-up-of-Renewable-Power-by-2022.pdf|title=Tentative State-wise break-up of Renewable Power target to be achieved by the year 2022 So that cumulative achievement is 1,75,000 MW|website=mnre.gov.in|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nEast and North east regions have no grid connected wind power plant as of December 2017. \n\nNo offshore wind farm is under implementation as of December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eqmagpro.com/offshore-wind-costs-fall-below-new-nuclear-plants-in-u-k/|title=Offshore Wind Costs Fall Below New Nuclear Plants in U.K.|accessdate=17 September 2017}}</ref> \nHowever, an Offshore Wind Policy was announced in 2015 and presently weather stations and [[Lidar|LIDARs]] are being set up by NIWE at some locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/u-k-offshore-wind-costs-fall-to-record-in-latest-auction|title=Offshore Wind Costs Fall Below New Nuclear Plants in U.K.|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> \nThe first offshore wind farm is planned near [[Dhanushkodi]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arichamunai-to-get-indias-first-offshore-wind-turbines/article23289198.ece|title=Arichamunai to get India\u2019s first offshore wind turbines.|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Electricity generation ==\nWind power accounts for nearly 10% of India's total installed power generation capacity and generated 62.03 [[TWh]] in the fiscal year 2018-19, which is nearly 4% of total electricity generation.<ref name= over>{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/generation/2019/March/actual/opm_01.pdf|title=CEA monthly utility electricity generation |accessdate= 3 May 2019}}</ref> The [[Capacity factor|capacity utilisation factor]] is nearly 19.33%  in the fiscal year 2018-19 (16% in 2017-18, 19.62% in 2016-17 and 14% in 2015-16). 70% of annual wind generation is during the five months duration from May to September coinciding with [[Monsoon|Southwest monsoon]] duration.\nIn India, [[Solar power in India|solar power]] is [[Solar hybrid power systems|complementary to wind power]] as it is generated mostly during the non monsoon period in daytime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/regen-enters-solar-power-with-hybrid-solution-115071800348_1.html|title=ReGen enters solar power with hybrid solution|accessdate= 16 October 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+Monthly Electricity Generation in India April, 2018 - March, 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/renewable/2019/renewable-03.pdf|title= Summary of All India Provisional Renewable Energy Generation, CEA |accessdate= 3 May 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n!

W. Golding, a British power engineer and authority on wind energy generation.<ref name=Wind_Energy/> Convinced of the potential of wind power in India, he recommended continued and extensive wind velocity surveys in different regions of India, the full-time assignment of staff to experimental wind power studies, the establishment of a dedicated research laboratory and development of small to medium-sized wind-powered electrical generators. Golding's recommendations were adopted by the CSIR in 1957.<ref name=Wind_Energy/> By this time, regions of [[Saurashtra (state)|Saurashtra]] and around [[Coimbatore]] had been identified as promising sites for generating electricity from wind power, and the Wind Power Sub-Committee had begun to erect 20 wind velocity survey stations across India, in addition to testing its indigenously designed windmills and obtaining a 6 kw. [[Allgaier (company)|Allgaier]] wind turbine, which was presented to India by the West German government; experiments at [[Porbandar]] with the latter had commenced by 1961.<ref name=Wind_Power/><ref name=Wind_Energy/> The Indian government also considered a proposal to erect over 20,000 small to medium-sized wind-powered electrical generators in rural districts, to be used for powering water pumps and supplying electricity for remotely situated structures such as lighthouses.<ref name=Wind_Power/>\n\nIn 1960, the CSIR established a Wind Power Division as part of the new National Aeronautical Laboratory (NAL) in Bangalore, which was founded that year.<ref name=Wind_Energy/> From the 1960s into the 1980s, the NAL and other groups continued to carry out wind velocity surveys and develop improved estimates of India's wind energy capacity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mani |first=Anna |date=1995 |title=Wind Energy Resource Survey in India - I |url= |location=New Delhi |publisher=Allied Publishers Limited |page=185 |isbn=81-7023-297-X |author-link= }}</ref> Large-scale development of wind power began in 1985 with the first wind project in Veraval, Gujarat, in the form of a 40-kW Dutch machine (make Polenko) connected to the grid.  The project, an initiative of late Dr. K S Rao, the then Director of GEDA (Gujarat Energy Development Agency), was a joint venture between GEDA and J K Synthetics Ltd. Though the performance of this machine was quite poor, it established the technical viability of operating wind turbines in the grid-connected mode in India. Subsequently, the Government of India planned several demonstration wind farms in the coastal regions of the country and simultaneously launched a massive programme to identify sites suitable for wind projects. In 1986, demonstration [[wind farm]]s were set up in the coastal areas of [[Maharashtra]] ([[Ratnagiri district|Ratnagiri]]), [[Gujarat]] ([[Okha, India|Okha]]) and [[Tamil Nadu]] ([[Tirunelveli]]) with 55&nbsp;kW Vestas wind turbines. These demonstration projects were supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|(MNRE]]). The demonstration projects set up in 1985-86 established beyond doubt, both the technical and economic viability of the wind energy projects, while the wind-mapping programme resulted in the identification of many sites suitable for wind power projects (C-WET 2001; Mani 1990, 1992, 1994; Mani and Mooley 1983).\n\nThe potential for wind farms in the country was first assessed in 2011 to be more than 2,000 GW by Prof. Jami Hossain of TERI University, New Delhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251627585_A_GIS_based_assessment_of_potential_for_windfarms_in_India|title=A GIS based assessment of potential for windfarms in India}}</ref>\nThis was subsequently re-validated by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, US (LBNL) in an independent study in 2012. \nAs a result, the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|MNRE]] set up a committee to reassess the potential<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283356238_Report_on_India's_Wind_Power_Potential|title=India Wind Power Potential}}</ref> and through the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE, previously C-WET) has announced a revised estimation of the potential wind resource in India from 49,130 MW to 302,000 MW assessed at 100&nbsp;m hub height.<ref name=\"states\">{{cite web|url=http://niwe.res.in/department_wra_est.php|title=Estimation of Installable Wind Power Potential at 80 m level in India|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> Wind turbines are now being set up at even 120 m hub height and the wind resource at higher hub heights of around 120 m or more that are prevailing is possibly even more. \n\nIn 2015, the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|MNRE]] set the target for Wind Power generation capacity by the year 2022 at 60,000 MW.<ref name=\"nre\">{{cite web|url=https://mnre.gov.in/the-ministry/physical-progress|title=Physical Progress (Achievements)|publisher=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, GoI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/Tentative-State-wise-break-up-of-Renewable-Power-by-2022.pdf|title=Tentative State-wise break-up of Renewable Power target to be achieved by the year 2022 So that cumulative achievement is 1,75,000 MW|website=mnre.gov.in|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nEast and North east regions have no grid connected wind power plant as of December 2017. \n\nNo offshore wind farm is under implementation as of December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eqmagpro.com/offshore-wind-costs-fall-below-new-nuclear-plants-in-u-k/|title=Offshore Wind Costs Fall Below New Nuclear Plants in U.K.|accessdate=17 September 2017}}</ref> \nHowever, an Offshore Wind Policy was announced in 2015 and presently weather stations and [[Lidar|LIDARs]] are being set up by NIWE at some locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/u-k-offshore-wind-costs-fall-to-record-in-latest-auction|title=Offshore Wind Costs Fall Below New Nuclear Plants in U.K.|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> \nThe first offshore wind farm is planned near [[Dhanushkodi]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arichamunai-to-get-indias-first-offshore-wind-turbines/article23289198.ece|title=Arichamunai to get India\u2019s first offshore wind turbines.|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Electricity generation ==\nWind power accounts for nearly 10% of India's total installed power generation capacity and generated 62.03 [[TWh]] in the fiscal year 2018-19, which is nearly 4% of total electricity generation.<ref name= over>{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/generation/2019/March/actual/opm_01.pdf|title=CEA monthly utility electricity generation |accessdate= 3 May 2019}}</ref> The [[Capacity factor|capacity utilisation factor]] is nearly 19.33%  in the fiscal year 2018-19 (16% in 2017-18, 19.62% in 2016-17 and 14% in 2015-16). 70% of annual wind generation is during the five months duration from May to September coinciding with [[Monsoon|Southwest monsoon]] duration.\nIn India, [[Solar power in India|solar power]] is [[Solar hybrid power systems|complementary to wind power]] as it is generated mostly during the non monsoon period in daytime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/regen-enters-solar-power-with-hybrid-solution-115071800348_1.html|title=ReGen enters solar power with hybrid solution|accessdate= 16 October 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+Monthly Electricity Generation in India April, 2018 - March, 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/monthly/renewable/2019/renewable-03.pdf|title= Summary of All India Provisional Renewable Energy Generation, CEA |accessdate= 3 May 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n!
