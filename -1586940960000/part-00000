He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the ''[[Reggae Sunsplash]]'' festival in 1992, and a rivalry with [[Bounty Killer]] began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer's style and catch phrases.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album ''Guns Out'', with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with \"Matie\" (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\n===International stardom===\nPartially as a result of prodding from his producers, [[Sly and Robbie]], with whom he recorded [[cover version]]s of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"Crazy Baldhead\" and \"No Woman No Cry\" in 1994, the latter a Jamaican chart-topper, Beenie Man converted to the [[Rastafari movement]], as did several of his contemporaries at the time, although in 2005 he stated \"I have not converted. I was baptised an [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\" /><ref name=\"Roper\" /> In 1994, he was signed by [[Island Records]] and released the critically acclaimed album ''[[Blessed (Beenie Man album)|Blessed]]'', which established his reputation internationally.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> In 1995 he toured the UK and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] version of Levy's \"Under Mi Sensi\".<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\nIn 1995, Beenie Man collaborated with [[Dennis Brown]] and [[Triston Palma]] to release ''Three Against War'' and [[Mad Cobra]] and [[Lieutenant Stitchie]] on ''Mad Cobra Meets Lt. Stitchie & Beenie Man''. He also collaborated with [[Lady Saw]] on \"Healing\", [[Sanchez (singer)|Sanchez]] on \"Refugee\", and [[Michael Prophet]] on \"Gun 'n' Bass\", further establishing his reputation.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal ''Maestro'', produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of \"Dancehall King\", a title only bestowed previously on [[Yellowman]] in the early 1980s.\nBeenie Man's first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded \"[[Who Am I (Beenie Man song)|Who Am I]]\" and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles.<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\nBeenie Man appeared as himself in the 1997 film ''[[Dancehall Queen]]''.\n\nIn 1998, Beenie Man headlined ''Reggae Sunsplash'' and signed to [[Virgin Records]] to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was ''The Doctor'' (1998). During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, \"Romie\", \"Who Am I\", and \"[[Girls Dem Sugar]]\", which featured American [[R&B]] singer, [[M\u00fda]].  During this time he received an impressive number of international music awards including a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best International Reggae Act in 1998,<ref name=\"Rodgers\">Rodgers, Jennifer (1998) [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-toasting-the-many-moods-of-beenie-man-1143114.html \"Music: Toasting the many moods of Beenie Man\"], ''[[The Independent]], 6 February 1998</ref> while remaining at the top of the local charts.

He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the ''[[Reggae Sunsplash]]'' festival in 1992, and a rivalry with [[Bounty Killer]] began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer's style and catch phrases.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album ''Guns Out'', with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with \"Matie\" (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\n===International stardom===\nPartially as a result of prodding from his producers, [[Sly and Robbie]], with whom he recorded [[cover version]]s of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"Crazy Baldhead\" and \"No Woman No Cry\" in 1994, the latter a Jamaican chart-topper, Beenie Man converted to the [[Rastafari movement]], as did several of his contemporaries at the time, although in 2005 he stated \"I have not converted. I was baptised an [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\" /><ref name=\"Roper\" /> In 1994, he was signed by [[Island Records]] and released the critically acclaimed album ''[[Blessed (Beenie Man album)|Blessed]]'', which established his reputation internationally.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> In 1995 he toured the UK and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] version of Levy's \"Under Mi Sensi\".<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\nIn 1995, Beenie Man collaborated with [[Dennis Brown]] and [[Triston Palma]] to release ''Three Against War'' and [[Mad Cobra]] and [[Lieutenant Stitchie]] on ''Mad Cobra Meets Lt.

He also collaborated with [[Lady Saw]] on \"Healing\", [[Sanchez (singer)|Sanchez]] on \"Refugee\", and [[Michael Prophet]] on \"Gun 'n' Bass\", further establishing his reputation.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal ''Maestro'', produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of \"Dancehall King\", a title only bestowed previously on [[Yellowman]] in the early 1980s.\nBeenie Man's first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded \"[[Who Am I (Beenie Man song)|Who Am I]]\" and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles.<ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n\nBeenie Man appeared as himself in the 1997 film ''[[Dancehall Queen]]''.\n\nIn 1998, Beenie Man headlined ''Reggae Sunsplash'' and signed to [[Virgin Records]] to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was ''The Doctor'' (1998). During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, \"Romie\", \"Who Am I\", and \"[[Girls Dem Sugar]]\", which featured American [[R&B]] singer, [[M\u00fda]].  During this time he received an impressive number of international music awards including a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best International Reggae Act in 1998,<ref name=\"Rodgers\">Rodgers, Jennifer (1998) [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-toasting-the-many-moods-of-beenie-man-1143114.html \"Music: Toasting the many moods of Beenie Man\"], ''[[The Independent]], 6 February 1998</ref> while remaining at the top of the local charts.

It is the headquarters of the [[Dharwad district]] of Karnataka and forms a contiguous urban area with the city of [[Hubballi]]. It was merged with Hubballi in 196 to form the twin cities of [[Hubballi-Dharwad]]. It covers an area of 213&nbsp;km\u00b2 and is located 430&nbsp;km northwest of [[Bengaluru]], on [[National Highway 48 (India)|NH-48]], between Bengaluru and [[Pune]].\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Chalukya]]s ruled Dharwad during the 12th century. A stone inscription indicates that there was a ruler by the name of BhaskaraDeva in 1117. In the 14th century, the district was first overrun by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], after which it was annexed to the newly established [[Hindu]] kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]], an official of which named Dhar Rao, according to local tradition, built the fort at Dharwad town in 1403. After the defeat of the king of Vijayanagar at Talikot (1565), Dharwad was for a few years practically independent under its Hindu governor; but in 1573 the fort was captured by the sultan of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Adil Shah]], and Dharwad was annexed to his dominions. Adil Shah built a fort in an area later called Manna Killa, and later Nazratabad. With this fort, the strategic importance of Dharwad increased and it attracted the attention of subsequent conquerors, including [[Aurangzeb]], [[Shivaji]], Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Muazzam known as Bahadur Shah I or Shah Alam, the seventh Mughal emperor (1707-1712), [[Peshwa]] [[Balaji Baji Rao]], [[Hyder Ali]], [[Tipu Sultan]] and finally the [[British Raj|British]] colonizers.\n\nIn 1685, the fort was taken by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]], and Dharwad, on the break-up of the Mughal empire, fell under the sway of the [[Maratha]] Peshwa of [[Pune]]. In 1764, the province was overrun by [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], who in 1778 captured the fort of Dharwad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_322.gif |title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 11, page 316 \u2013 Imperial Gazetteer of India \u2013 Digital South Asia Library |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> The [[Siege of Darwar|fort was retaken]] in 1791 by the Marathas. After the final defeat of the Peshwa by the British in 1818, Dharwar was incorporated into the territory of the [[British East India Company]]'s [[Bombay Presidency]]. During the early 19th century, when the British were expanding their domains, they faced a lot of opposition from local rulers, including Baba Saheb of Naragund and [[Kittur Chennamma]]. Dharwad was independent before 1947.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title= Population Growth of Hubli\u2013Dharwad\n|state=\n|1901= 81143\n|1911= 91031\n|1921= 100992\n|1931= 124398\n|1941= 143504\n|1951= 196180\n|1961= 248489\n|1971= 379166\n|1981= 527108\n|1991= 648298\n|2001= 786195\n|2011= 943857\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote= Source: [[Census of India]]<ref name=\"popu-history\">\n{{cite web\n  | url        = http://censusindia.gov.in/DigitalLibrary/data/Census_2001/Table/India/Class%20I-A-4_Final.xls\n  | title        = Provisional population totals, Census of India 2011\n  | accessdate        = 29 November 2011\n  | archive-url        = http://censusindia.gov.in/DigitalLibrary/data/Census_2001/Table/India/Class%20I-A-4_Final.xls\n  | archive-date        = 5 April 2020\n  | url-status        = live\n  | df        = dmy-all\n  }}\n</ref>}}\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title= Population Growth of Hubli\n|state=\n|1901= 59913\n|1911= 61440\n|1921= 66772\n|1931= 83494\n|1941= 95512\n|1951= 129609\n|1961= 171326\n|2001= 533820\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote= Source: [[Census of India]]<ref name=\"popu-history\"></ref><ref name=AboutTwinCity>{{cite web|url=http://hdmc.gov.in/cityprofile.php|title=HDMC ABOUT TWIN CITY|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420105843/http://www.hdmc.gov.in/cityprofile.php|archivedate=2012-04-20}}</ref>}}\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title= Population Growth of Dharwad\n|state=\n|1901= 21230\n|1911= 29591\n|1921= 34220\n|1931= 40904\n|1941= 47992\n|1951= 66571\n|1961= 77163\n|2001= 252375\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote= Source: [[Census of India]]<ref name=\"popu-history\"></ref><ref name=AboutTwinCity />}}\n\nThe population of the twin cities as per provisional figures of Census 2011 is 943,857 and is urban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/karnataka/4-population-8-19.pdf |title=Census of India 2011 Provisional Population Totals}}</ref> Hubli-Dharwad's population increased 22.99% between 1981 and 1991, from 527,108 to 648,298, and by 21.2% between 1991 and 2001.

It is the headquarters of the [[Dharwad district]] of [[Karnataka]] and forms a contiguous urban area with the city of Hubballi. It was merged with [[Hubballi]] in 196 to form the twin cities of [[Hubballi-Dharwad]]. It covers an area of 213&nbsp;km\u00b2 and is located 430&nbsp;km northwest of [[Bangalore]], on [[National Highway 48 (India)|NH-48]], between Bangalore and [[Pune]].\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Chalukya]]s ruled Dharwad during the 12th century. A stone inscription indicates that there was a ruler by the name of BhaskaraDeva in 1117. In the 14th century, the district was first overrun by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], after which it was annexed to the newly established [[Hindu]] kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]], an official of which named Dhar Rao, according to local tradition, built the fort at Dharwad town in 1403. After the defeat of the king of Vijayanagar at Talikot (1565), Dharwad was for a few years practically independent under its Hindu governor; but in 1573 the fort was captured by the sultan of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Adil Shah]], and Dharwad was annexed to his dominions. Adil Shah built a fort in an area later called Manna Killa, and later Nazratabad. With this fort, the strategic importance of Dharwad increased and it attracted the attention of subsequent conquerors, including [[Aurangzeb]], [[Shivaji]], Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Muazzam known as Bahadur Shah I or Shah Alam, the seventh Mughal emperor (1707-1712), [[Peshwa]] [[Balaji Baji Rao]], [[Hyder Ali]], [[Tipu Sultan]] and finally the [[British Raj|British]] colonizers.\n\nIn 1685, the fort was taken by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]], and Dharwad, on the break-up of the Mughal empire, fell under the sway of the [[Maratha]] Peshwa of [[Pune]]. In 1764, the province was overrun by [[Hyder Ali]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], who in 1778 captured the fort of Dharwad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_322.gif |title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 11, page 316 \u2013 Imperial Gazetteer of India \u2013 Digital South Asia Library |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> The [[Siege of Darwar|fort was retaken]] in 1791 by the Marathas. After the final defeat of the Peshwa by the British in 1818, Dharwar was incorporated into the territory of the [[British East India Company]]'s [[Bombay Presidency]]. During the early 19th century, when the British were expanding their domains, they faced a lot of opposition from local rulers, including Baba Saheb of Naragund and [[Kittur Chennamma]]. Dharwad was independent before 1947.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title= Population Growth of Hubli\u2013Dharwad\n|state=\n|1901= 81143\n|1911= 91031\n|1921= 100992\n|1931= 124398\n|1941= 143504\n|1951= 196180\n|1961= 248489\n|1971= 379166\n|1981= 527108\n|1991= 648298\n|2001= 786195\n|2011= 943857\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote= Source: [[Census of India]]<ref name=\"popu-history\">\n{{cite web\n  | url        = http://censusindia.gov.in/DigitalLibrary/data/Census_2001/Table/India/Class%20I-A-4_Final.xls\n  | title        = Provisional population totals, Census of India 2011\n  | accessdate        = 29 November 2011\n  | archive-url        = http://censusindia.gov.in/DigitalLibrary/data/Census_2001/Table/India/Class%20I-A-4_Final.xls\n  | archive-date        = 5 April 2020\n  | url-status        = live\n  | df        = dmy-all\n  }}\n</ref>}}\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title= Population Growth of Hubli\n|state=\n|1901= 59913\n|1911= 61440\n|1921= 66772\n|1931= 83494\n|1941= 95512\n|1951= 129609\n|1961= 171326\n|2001= 533820\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote= Source: [[Census of India]]<ref name=\"popu-history\"></ref><ref name=AboutTwinCity>{{cite web|url=http://hdmc.gov.in/cityprofile.php|title=HDMC ABOUT TWIN CITY|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420105843/http://www.hdmc.gov.in/cityprofile.php|archivedate=2012-04-20}}</ref>}}\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n|title= Population Growth of Dharwad\n|state=\n|1901= 21230\n|1911= 29591\n|1921= 34220\n|1931= 40904\n|1941= 47992\n|1951= 66571\n|1961= 77163\n|2001= 252375\n|estimate=\n|estyear=\n|estref=\n|footnote= Source: [[Census of India]]<ref name=\"popu-history\"></ref><ref name=AboutTwinCity />}}\n\nThe population of the twin cities as per provisional figures of Census 2011 is 943,857 and is urban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/karnataka/4-population-8-19.pdf |title=Census of India 2011 Provisional Population Totals}}</ref> Hubli-Dharwad's population increased 22.99% between 1981 and 1991, from 527,108 to 648,298, and by 21.2% between 1991 and 2001.
