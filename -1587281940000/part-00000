When [[Aurel Stein]] passed through the town in the early twentieth century he was pleased to find that Tashkurgan matched the descriptions left by those travellers: discussing Qiepantuo, Xuanzang recorded (in [[Samuel Beal]]'s translation), \"This country is about 200 li in circuit; the capital rests on a great rocky crag of the mountain, and is backed by the river \u015ait\u00e2.

She becomes pregnant from a mysterious stranger, ultimately giving birth to a powerful king and founding the royal line ruling at the time of [[Xuanzang]]'s visit.

They are labelled as dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Warring States period]] (475\u2212221 BCE). The mummies were discovered in the nearby Xiabandi Valley on the old caravan route to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]]. The valley has now been flooded for a hydro-electric project.\n\n==Geography==\nTashkurgan is the seat of [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]]. It is situated at an altitude of {{convert|3090|m}} on the borders of both [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and close to the borders of [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Tashkurgan is a market town for sheep, wool and woollen goods, particularly carpets, and is surrounded by orchards. The majority population in the town are ethnic [[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Mountain Tajiks]]. The majority of people in the region speak [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]]. There is also a village of [[Wakhi language|Wakhi speakers]]. [[Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are also spoken.\n\nThe [[Tashkurgan River]] begins just north of the [[Khunjerab Pass]] and flows north along the [[Karakoram Highway]] to Tashkurgan.  Just north of Tashkurgan it turns east and flows through a gorge to the [[Tarim Basin]] where it joins the [[Yarkand River]].\n\n===Climate===\nTashkurgan has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BWk''), influenced by the high elevation, with long, very cold winters, and warm summers. Monthly daily average temperatures range from {{convert|\u221211.9|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|16.4|\u00b0C|1}} in July, while the annual mean is {{convert|3.58|\u00b0C|1}}. An average of only {{convert|68|mm|2}} of precipitation falls per year.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y\n|location = Tashkurgan (1971\u22122000)\n|Jan high C = \u22124.2\n|Feb high C

Special registration with the police must be made before entering Tashkurgan, and Chinese citizens must receive written permission from their local police department before entering the region.\n\nTravelling from Xinjiang, it is about {{convert|230|km}} south of [[Kashgar]] and is the last town before the border with [[Pakistan]].  It is {{convert|120|km}} over the [[Khunjerab Pass]] from [[Sust]], which is the Pakistani border town.  Passenger road service between Tashkurgan and the Pakistani towns of Sust and [[Gilgit]] has existed for many years, and road service between Kashgar and Gilgit (via Tashkurgan and Sust) started in summer 2006.  However, the border crossing between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Pass (the highest border of the world) is open only between May 1 and October 15.  During winter, the roads are blocked by snow.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=World's biggest building project aims to make China great again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/chinese-president-belt-and-road-initiative|website=The Guardian|accessdate=12 May 2017|date=11 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Belt and Road Initiative]]\n* [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]]\n* [[Taghdumbash Pamir]]\n* [[Taxkorgan Nature Reserve]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon, George Nathaniel]]. 1896.

She becomes pregnant from a mysterious stranger, ultimately giving birth to a powerful king and founding the royal line ruling at the time of [[Xuanzang]]'s visit.
