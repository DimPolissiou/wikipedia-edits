Glasgow Airport began to offer flights to other places around the world, flights which previously used [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]], which was subsequently relegated as the city's secondary airport catering for [[low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], freight and charter operators.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the present Glasgow Airport goes back to 1932, when the site at [[Abbotsinch]], between the [[River Cart#Black Cart Water|Black Cart Water]] and the [[River Cart#White Cart Water|White Cart Water]], near Paisley in Renfrewshire, was opened. In 1933 the [[Royal Air Force]] [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|602 Squadron]] (City of Glasgow) [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force|Auxiliary Air Force]] moved its [[Westland Wapiti|Wapiti IIA]] aircraft from nearby Renfrew.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\">Smith, Abbotsinch</ref> The RAF Station HQ, however, was not formed until 1 July 1936 when 6 Auxiliary Group, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], arrived.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> From May 1939, until moving away in October 1939, the Squadron flew the [[Supermarine Spitfire]].\n\n===1940===\nIn 1940, a [[torpedo]] training unit was formed, which trained both RAF and [[Royal Navy]] crews.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> On 11 August 1943 Abbotsinch was handed over solely to the Royal Navy and it became a [[stone frigate|naval base]]. All [[Her Majesty's Ship]]s and naval bases are given ship names and Abbotsinch's was known as HMS Sanderling since June 1940.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> During the 1950s, the airfield housed a large aircraft storage unit and squadrons of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].\n\nThe Royal Navy left in October 1963.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> The name [[Sanderling]] was, however, retained as a link between the two: HMS Sanderling's [[ship's bell]] was presented to the new airport and a bar in the airport was named ''The Sanderling Bar''.\n\n===1960s===\nIn the 1960s, [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow Corporation]] decided that a new airport for the city was required. The original site of Glasgow's main airport, [[Renfrew Airport]], was {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} east of Abbotsinch, in what is now the Dean Park area of Renfrew. The original [[Art Deco]] terminal building of the original airport has not survived. The site is now occupied by a [[Tesco]] supermarket and the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]]; this straight and level section of motorway occupies the site of the [[runway]].<ref name=\"smith-renfrew\">Smith, Renfrew</ref>\n\nAbbotsinch took over from Renfrew Airport on 2 May 1966.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /><ref name=\"smith-renfrew\" /> The [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] had already committed millions into rebuilding [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick Airport]] fit for the \"[[jet age]]\". Nevertheless, the plan went forward and the new airport, designed by [[Basil Spence]] and built at a cost of \u00a34.2&nbsp;million, was completed in 1966, with [[British European Airways]] beginning services using [[De Havilland Comet]] aircraft.\n\nThe first commercial flight to arrive was a British European Airways flight from Edinburgh, landing at 8&nbsp;am on 2 May 1966.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The airport was officially opened on 27 June 1966 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The political rows over Glasgow and Prestwick airports continued, with Prestwick enjoying a monopoly over [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] traffic (under the 1946 US-UK [[bilateral air transport agreement]] known as the [[Bermuda Agreement]]), while Glasgow Airport was only allowed to handle UK and intra-European traffic.\n\n===1970s to 1990s===\n[[File:The Aftermath - geograph.org.uk - 485211.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]]]]\nIn 1975, the BAA took ownership of Glasgow Airport. When BAA was [[Privatization|privatised]] in the late 1980s, as BAA plc, it consolidated its airport portfolio and sold Prestwick Airport. BAA embarked on a massive redevelopment plan for Glasgow International Airport in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glasgow Airport Guide|url=http://www.glasgow-airport-guide.co.uk/history.html|website=History of Glasgow Airport|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201105252/http://www.glasgow-airport-guide.co.uk/history.html|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAn extended terminal building was created by building a pre-fabricated metal structure around the front of the original Basil Spence building, hence screening much of its distinctive [[Brutalism|Brutalist]] style architecture from view, with the void between the two structures joined by a glass atrium and walkway. Spence's original concrete facade which once looked onto Caledonia Road now fronts the [[check-in]] desks. The original building can be seen more clearly from the rear, with the mock barrel-vaulted roof visible when airside.\n\nA dedicated international departure lounge and pier was added at the western side of the building, leaving the facility with a total of 38 [[Gate (airport)|gates]], bringing its capacity up to nine million passengers per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 2003, BAA completed redevelopment work on a satellite building (called \"T2\", formerly the St. Andrews Building), to provide a dedicated check-in facility for low-cost airlines, principally Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Airways and formerly [[Thomas Cook Airlines]] until they went into administration.\n\nBy 1996, Glasgow was handling over 5.5&nbsp;million passengers per annum, making it the fourth-largest airport in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/1996Annual/Table_09_Terminal_and_Transit_Pax_1996.pdf |title=Terminal & Transit Passengers at UK Airports \u2013 1996 |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|UK Civil Aviation Authority]] |year=1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606114851/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/1996Annual/Table_09_Terminal_and_Transit_Pax_1996.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Today===\n[[File:16-11-16-Glasgow Airport-RR2 7310.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Terminal 2 building, situated next to the main terminal building]]\n[[File:Glasgowairport3.jpg|thumb|Tail fins at the international pier]]\n[[File:Glasgow Airport DSC 0856 (13765675113).jpg|thumb|right|215px|Glasgow Airport main terminal building]]\nThe airport serves a variety of destinations throughout Europe, North America and the Middle East.

This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.\n\nFuture growth is hampered by the airport's location, which is constrained by the M8 motorway to the south, the town of Renfrew to the east and the [[River Clyde]] to the north. At present the areas of [[Drumchapel]], [[Clydebank]], [[Bearsden]], [[Foxbar]], [[Faifley]] and [[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]] all sit directly underneath the approach paths into the airport, meaning that further increases in traffic may be politically sensitive. The airport is challenged by [[Edinburgh Airport]], which now serves a wider range of European destinations and has grown to overtake Glasgow as Scotland's busiest airport.\n\nThe [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]] announced in 2002 that a rail line \u2013 known as the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]] (GARL) \u2013 would be built from [[Glasgow Central station]] to Glasgow Airport. The rail link was to be completed by 2012 with the first trains running early in 2013. In 2009, however, it was announced by the Scottish Government that the plan had been cancelled.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm | title = Ministers scrap airport rail plan | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 September 2009 | access-date = 17 September 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170728210311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm | archive-date = 28 July 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the airport is easily accessible by road due with direct access to the adjoining M8 motorway.

Eight people were killed and three seriously injured. No one on the ground was hurt. A [[fatal accident inquiry]] into the accident later found that the aircraft developed an engine malfunction during take off. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash.\n* On 30 June 2007, a day after the [[2007 London car bombs|failed car bomb attacks in London]], an [[2007 Glasgow Airport attack|attack at Glasgow International Airport]] occurred. A flaming [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] was driven into the entrance of Main Terminal. Two men, one alight, fled the vehicle before being apprehended by a combination of police officers, airport security officers and witnesses. One of the men died in the following months due to injuries sustained in the attack. New barriers and security measures have been added to prevent a similar incident from taking place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/glasgow-airport-news-221107.htm|title=UK-Airport-News - Airport Transportation|website=www.uk-airport-news.info|access-date=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121033949/http://www.uk-airport-news.info/glasgow-airport-news-221107.htm|archive-date=21 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Ground transport==\n[[File:First Glasgow airport bus 2019.jpg|thumb|right|Airport express buses are painted in a distinctive livery.]]\nThe airport is currently linked to Glasgow City Centre by Glasgow Shuttle bus service 500.

Glasgow Airport began to offer flights to other places around the world, flights which previously used [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]], which was subsequently relegated as the city's secondary airport catering for [[low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], freight and charter operators.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the present Glasgow Airport goes back to 1932, when the site at [[Abbotsinch]], between the [[River Cart#Black Cart Water|Black Cart Water]] and the [[River Cart#White Cart Water|White Cart Water]], near Paisley in Renfrewshire, was opened. In 1933 the [[Royal Air Force]] [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|602 Squadron]] (City of Glasgow) [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force|Auxiliary Air Force]] moved its [[Westland Wapiti|Wapiti IIA]] aircraft from nearby Renfrew.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\">Smith, Abbotsinch</ref> The RAF Station HQ, however, was not formed until 1 July 1936 when 6 Auxiliary Group, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], arrived.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> From May 1939, until moving away in October 1939, the Squadron flew the [[Supermarine Spitfire]].\n\n===1940===\nIn 1940, a [[torpedo]] training unit was formed, which trained both RAF and [[Royal Navy]] crews.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> On 11 August 1943 Abbotsinch was handed over solely to the Royal Navy and it became a [[stone frigate|naval base]]. All [[Her Majesty's Ship]]s and naval bases are given ship names and Abbotsinch's was known as HMS Sanderling since June 1940.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> During the 1950s, the airfield housed a large aircraft storage unit and squadrons of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].\n\nThe Royal Navy left in October 1963.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /> The name [[Sanderling]] was, however, retained as a link between the two: HMS Sanderling's [[ship's bell]] was presented to the new airport and a bar in the airport was named ''The Sanderling Bar''.\n\n===1960s===\nIn the 1960s, [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow Corporation]] decided that a new airport for the city was required. The original site of Glasgow's main airport, [[Renfrew Airport]], was {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} east of Abbotsinch, in what is now the Dean Park area of Renfrew. The original [[Art Deco]] terminal building of the original airport has not survived. The site is now occupied by a [[Tesco]] supermarket and the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]]; this straight and level section of motorway occupies the site of the [[runway]].<ref name=\"smith-renfrew\">Smith, Renfrew</ref>\n\nAbbotsinch took over from Renfrew Airport on 2 May 1966.<ref name=\"smith-abbotsinch\" /><ref name=\"smith-renfrew\" /> The [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] had already committed millions into rebuilding [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick Airport]] fit for the \"[[jet age]]\". Nevertheless, the plan went forward and the new airport, designed by [[Basil Spence]] and built at a cost of \u00a34.2&nbsp;million, was completed in 1966, with [[British European Airways]] beginning services using [[De Havilland Comet]] aircraft.\n\nThe first commercial flight to arrive was a British European Airways flight from Edinburgh, landing at 8&nbsp;am on 2 May 1966.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The airport was officially opened on 27 June 1966 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The political rows over Glasgow and Prestwick airports continued, with Prestwick enjoying a monopoly over [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] traffic (under the 1946 US-UK [[bilateral air transport agreement]] known as the [[Bermuda Agreement]]), while Glasgow Airport was only allowed to handle UK and intra-European traffic.\n\n===1970s to 1990s===\n[[File:The Aftermath - geograph.org.uk - 485211.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]]]]\nIn 1975, the BAA took ownership of Glasgow Airport. When BAA was [[Privatization|privatised]] in the late 1980s, as BAA plc, it consolidated its airport portfolio and sold Prestwick Airport. BAA embarked on a massive redevelopment plan for Glasgow International Airport in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glasgow Airport Guide|url=http://www.glasgow-airport-guide.co.uk/history.html|website=History of Glasgow Airport|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201105252/http://www.glasgow-airport-guide.co.uk/history.html|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAn extended terminal building was created by building a pre-fabricated metal structure around the front of the original Basil Spence building, hence screening much of its distinctive [[Brutalism|Brutalist]] style architecture from view, with the void between the two structures joined by a glass atrium and walkway. Spence's original concrete facade which once looked onto Caledonia Road now fronts the [[check-in]] desks. The original building can be seen more clearly from the rear, with the mock barrel-vaulted roof visible when airside.\n\nA dedicated international departure lounge and pier was added at the western side of the building, leaving the facility with a total of 38 [[Gate (airport)|gates]], bringing its capacity up to nine million passengers per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 2003, BAA completed redevelopment work on a satellite building (called \"T2\", formerly the St. Andrews Building), to provide a dedicated check-in facility for low-cost airlines, principally Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Airways and formerly [[Thomas Cook Airlines]] until they went into administration.\n\nBy 1996, Glasgow was handling over 5.5&nbsp;million passengers per annum, making it the fourth-largest airport in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/1996Annual/Table_09_Terminal_and_Transit_Pax_1996.pdf |title=Terminal & Transit Passengers at UK Airports \u2013 1996 |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|UK Civil Aviation Authority]] |year=1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606114851/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/1996Annual/Table_09_Terminal_and_Transit_Pax_1996.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Today===\n[[File:16-11-16-Glasgow Airport-RR2 7310.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Terminal 2 building, situated next to the main terminal building]]\n[[File:Glasgowairport3.jpg|thumb|Tail fins at the international pier]]\n[[File:Glasgow Airport DSC 0856 (13765675113).jpg|thumb|right|215px|Glasgow Airport main terminal building]]\nThe airport serves a variety of destinations throughout Europe, North America and the Middle East.

This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.\n\nFuture growth is hampered by the airport's location, which is constrained by the M8 motorway to the south, the town of Renfrew to the east and the [[River Clyde]] to the north. At present the areas of [[Drumchapel]], [[Clydebank]], [[Bearsden]], [[Foxbar]], [[Faifley]] and [[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]] all sit directly underneath the approach paths into the airport, meaning that further increases in traffic may be politically sensitive. The airport is challenged by [[Edinburgh Airport]], which now serves a wider range of European destinations and has grown to overtake Glasgow as Scotland's busiest airport.\n\nThe [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]] announced in 2002 that a rail line \u2013 known as the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]] (GARL) \u2013 would be built from [[Glasgow Central station]] to Glasgow Airport. The rail link was to be completed by 2012 with the first trains running early in 2013.

Eight people were killed and three seriously injured. No one on the ground was hurt. A [[fatal accident inquiry]] into the accident later found that the aircraft developed an engine malfunction during take off. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash.\n* On 30 June 2007, a day after the [[2007 London car bombs|failed car bomb attacks in London]], an [[2007 Glasgow Airport attack|attack at Glasgow International Airport]] occurred. A flaming [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] was driven into the entrance of Main Terminal. Two men, one alight, fled the vehicle before being apprehended by a combination of police officers, airport security officers and witnesses. One of the men died in the following months due to injuries sustained in the attack. New barriers and security measures have been added to prevent a similar incident from taking place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-airport-news.info/glasgow-airport-news-221107.htm|title=UK-Airport-News - Airport Transportation|website=www.uk-airport-news.info|access-date=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121033949/http://www.uk-airport-news.info/glasgow-airport-news-221107.htm|archive-date=21 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Ground transport==\n[[File:First Glasgow airport bus 2019.jpg|thumb|right|Airport express buses are painted in a distinctive livery.]]\nThe airport is currently linked to Glasgow City Centre by Glasgow Shuttle bus service 500.
