The film stars [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[John Abraham]] and [[Priyanka Chopra]], with [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kirron Kher]], [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] and [[Boman Irani]] in supporting roles. ''Dostana'' tells the story of two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with a girl; eventually, both fall in love with her.\n\nMansukhani conceived the film as a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce [[homosexuality]] (which he thought was unexplored by [[Bollywood]]) to shed light on the issue for the Indian audience. [[Manish Malhotra]] designed Chopra's costumes, and [[Aki Narula]] designed costumes for the rest of the cast. The soundtrack was composed by [[Vishal\u2013Shekhar]] and [[Anvita Dutt Guptan]]; [[Kumaar]] and [[Vishal Dadlani]] wrote its lyrics.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] over a two-month period in the first half of 2008. ''Dostana'' was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic largely ignored by Hindi cinema. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, ''Dostana'' grossed over {{INR}}871&nbsp;million, becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2008|eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year]].\n\n''Dostana'' received nine nominations for the [[54th Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Bachchan), and [[Filmfare Award for Best Music Director|Best Music Director]]. The film was influential in creating [[Fashion in India|fashion trends in India]], with Chopra's silver [[sari]] (worn in the song \"Desi Girl\") becoming popular. Abraham's yellow trunks, Chopra's golden swimsuit and the actors' looks and style received considerable attention and were popular with youngsters. ''Dostana'' is regarded as one of the most stylish and trend-setting of Indian films, with ''[[Filmfare]]'' ranking it first in a 2013 poll. A sequel, ''[[Dostana 2]]'', is scheduled to release in 2020.\n\n== Plot ==\nSameer \"Sam\" Acharya, a [[Men in nursing|male nurse]] and Kunal Chauhan, a [[Fashion photography|fashion photographer]] are fun-loving, womanising bachelors in [[Miami]]. They first meet at a friend's place after a night out with girls and run into each other again when they are interested in renting the same apartment. The apartment belongs to Neha Melwani, who works for ''[[Verve (Indian magazine)|Verve]]''. She lives there with her aunt Ishita \"Ishu\" Melwani, who refuses to sublet the apartment to either of them since Neha wants girls as flatmates. After meeting a gay soldier, Sam persuades a reluctant Kunal to pretend that they are lovers so they can rent the apartment. They regret their decision when they meet Neha since they are attracted to her. The three become good friends, and Sam and Kunal fall in love with her.\n\nAs Sam and Kunal continue the charade, Sam convinces Kunal to apply for a [[Domestic partnership in the United States|domestic partnership]] with him, as Kunal is a US citizen and Sam is not. Unknown to them, the approval letter is sent to his conservative mother Mrs. Acharya in London. Neha's gay boss, Murli \"M\", resigns as ''Verve''{{'}}s editor and must choose his successor. To impress him (and hopefully get the job), Neha invites him for dinner at her house and asks Sam and Kunal to entertain him. A US immigration agent visits them for a surprise inspection and joins the party. Chaos ensues when Rani arrives from London to confront her son about his newfound sexuality. Sam tries to deny his relationship with Kunal, but the immigration agent affirms that they are a couple. M becomes upset because Neha had told him Sam and Kunal were both single, and leaves.\n\nAt Neha's office the following day, M announces that Abhimanyu \"Abhi\" Singh will be the new editor. Neha, upset at being passed over for promotion, goes home and is consoled by Mrs. Acharya; in turn, she helps Mrs. Acharya accept her son's sexuality. Kunal and Sam help Neha with a project assigned by Abhi, who is impressed with her work. They later take Neha on separate dates, both telling her that they love her. Neha convinced that they are gay, sees the dates as friendly outings. When Abhi and Neha begin dating, Sam and Kunal sabotage the budding relationship by giving Abhi inappropriate advice; this irritates Neha, and she and Abhi quarrel. When Neha discovers Kunal and Sam's plan, she misinterprets it as jealousy of Abhi.\n\nSam and Kunal redirect their efforts into frightening Veer, Abhi's five-year-old son, about his future with Neha. During a basketball game, Neha discovers that Abhi plans to propose to her and asks for Kunal and Sameer's advice. They ask her to turn him down, admitting that their homosexuality is a ruse and they both love her. Veer tells Abhi about his fears, and during the game, Abhi breaks up with Neha. She tearfully evicts Kunal and Sameer from her apartment, and resigns from ''Verve''.\n\nA few months later Kunal and Sam meet in court, where they are picking up [[residence permit]]s. Recognising the value of their friendship with Neha and each other, they reconcile. They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which they will go to regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees.\n\nTwo months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say \"no\", remembering their kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast is listed below:<ref name=\"boi\" /><ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/dostana-3/cast/ |title=Dostana Cast & Crew |website=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313123045/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/dostana-3/cast/ |archive-date=13 March 2017 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Abhishek Bachchan]] as Sameer \"Sam\" Acharya \n* [[John Abraham]] as Kunal Chauhan \n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Neha Melwani\n* [[Bobby Deol]] as Abhimanyu \"Abhi\" Singh, Neha's new boss and boyfriend\n* [[Kirron Kher]] as Mrs. Acharya, Sam's mother\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Ishita \"Ishu\" Melwani, Neha's aunt\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Murli \"M\", Neha's ex-boss\n* Shrey Bawa as Veer Singh, Abhimanyu's son\n* [[Shilpa Shetty]] (cameo appearance in the song \"Shut Up & Bounce\")\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nDuring the production of ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), [[Tarun Mansukhani]] conceived a film about three friends who share an apartment.<ref name=\"nobash\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1081120/jsp/entertainment/story_10133869.jsp |title=\u2018There is no gay bashing\u2019 |last=Shah, Jigar |date=20 November 2008 |website=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313100401/https://www.telegraphindia.com/1081120/jsp/entertainment/story_10133869.jsp |archive-date=13 March 2017 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> After the production wrapped, [[Karan Johar]] told him that Mansukhani was ready to direct a film and should write a script; if Johar liked it, he would produce the film.<ref name=\"nobash\" /> He set the film in [[Miami]], since he liked its lifestyle and culture: \"People in Miami work hard and party harder and I wanted to capture that in my film.\"<ref name=\"act\">{{Cite web |url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/aug/26sli1.htm |title='Abhishek, John act gay in Dostana' |last=Ramani, Nithya |date=26 August 2008 |website=[[Rediff.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829055401/http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/aug/26sli1.htm |archive-date=29 August 2008 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> Mansukhani worked for eight months on the script; Johar liked it, and asked him about the cast.<ref name=\"nobash\" /> In an interview, Manuskhani described ''Dostana'' as a story of \"how the three strangers come together, live together in an apartment and have their moments of happiness and sorrow.\"<ref name=\"act\" />\n\nThe director was inspired by his own experiences: \"The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends.

He decided to use [[sexuality]] to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.<ref name=\"nobash\" />\n\nMansukhani later added the gay storyline because he thought it was an issue that needed to be touched on.

The film stars [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[John Abraham]] and [[Priyanka Chopra]], with [[Bobby Deol]], [[Kirron Kher]], [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] and [[Boman Irani]] in supporting roles. ''Dostana'' tells the story of two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with a girl; eventually, both fall in love with her.\n\nMansukhani conceived the film as a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce [[homosexuality]] (which he thought was unexplored by [[Bollywood]]) to shed light on the issue for the Indian audience. [[Manish Malhotra]] designed Chopra's costumes, and [[Aki Narula]] designed costumes for the rest of the cast. The soundtrack was composed by [[Vishal\u2013Shekhar]] and [[Anvita Dutt Guptan]]; [[Kumaar]] and [[Vishal Dadlani]] wrote its lyrics.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] over a two-month period in the first half of 2008. ''Dostana'' was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic largely ignored by Hindi cinema. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, ''Dostana'' grossed over {{INR}}871&nbsp;million, becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2008|eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year]].\n\n''Dostana'' received nine nominations for the [[54th Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Bachchan), and [[Filmfare Award for Best Music Director|Best Music Director]]. The film was influential in creating [[Fashion in India|fashion trends in India]], with Chopra's silver [[sari]] (worn in the song \"Desi Girl\") becoming popular. Abraham's yellow trunks, Chopra's golden swimsuit and the actors' looks and style received considerable attention and were popular with youngsters. ''Dostana'' is regarded as one of the most stylish and trend-setting of Indian films, with ''[[Filmfare]]'' ranking it first in a 2013 poll. A sequel, ''[[Dostana 2]]'', is scheduled to release in 2020.\n\n== Plot ==\nSameer \"Sam\" Acharya, a [[Men in nursing|male nurse]] and Kunal Chauhan, a [[Fashion photography|fashion photographer]] are fun-loving, womanising bachelors in [[Miami]]. They first meet at a friend's place after a night out with girls and run into each other again when they are interested in renting the same apartment. The apartment belongs to Neha Melwani, who works for ''[[Verve (Indian magazine)|Verve]]''. She lives there with her aunt Ishita \"Ishu\" Melwani, who refuses to sublet the apartment to either of them since Neha wants girls as flatmates. After meeting a gay soldier, Sam persuades a reluctant Kunal to pretend that they are lovers so they can rent the apartment. They regret their decision when they meet Neha since they are attracted to her. The three become good friends, and Sam and Kunal fall in love with her.\n\nAs Sam and Kunal continue the charade, Sam convinces Kunal to apply for a [[Domestic partnership in the United States|domestic partnership]] with him, as Kunal is a US citizen and Sam is not. Unknown to them, the approval letter is sent to his conservative mother Mrs. Acharya in London. Neha's gay boss, Murli \"M\", resigns as ''Verve''{{'}}s editor and must choose his successor. To impress him (and hopefully get the job), Neha invites him for dinner at her house and asks Sam and Kunal to entertain him. A US immigration agent visits them for a surprise inspection and joins the party. Chaos ensues when Rani arrives from London to confront her son about his newfound sexuality. Sam tries to deny his relationship with Kunal, but the immigration agent affirms that they are a couple. M becomes upset because Neha had told him Sam and Kunal were both single, and leaves.\n\nAt Neha's office the following day, M announces that Abhimanyu \"Abhi\" Singh will be the new editor. Neha, upset at being passed over for promotion, goes home and is consoled by Mrs. Acharya; in turn, she helps Mrs. Acharya accept her son's sexuality. Kunal and Sam help Neha with a project assigned by Abhi, who is impressed with her work. They later take Neha on separate dates, both telling her that they love her. Neha convinced that they are gay, sees the dates as friendly outings. When Abhi and Neha begin dating, Sam and Kunal sabotage the budding relationship by giving Abhi inappropriate advice; this irritates Neha, and she and Abhi quarrel. When Neha discovers Kunal and Sam's plan, she misinterprets it as jealousy of Abhi.\n\nSam and Kunal redirect their efforts into frightening Veer, Abhi's five-year-old son, about his future with Neha. During a basketball game, Neha discovers that Abhi plans to propose to her and asks for Kunal and Sameer's advice. They ask her to turn him down, admitting that their homosexuality is a ruse and they both love her. Veer tells Abhi about his fears, and during the game, Abhi breaks up with Neha. She tearfully evicts Kunal and Sameer from her apartment, and resigns from ''Verve''.\n\nA few months later Kunal and Sam meet in court, where they are picking up [[residence permit]]s. Recognising the value of their friendship with Neha and each other, they reconcile. They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which they will go to regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees.\n\nTwo months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say \"no\", remembering their kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast is listed below:<ref name=\"boi\" /><ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/dostana-3/cast/ |title=Dostana Cast & Crew |website=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313123045/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/dostana-3/cast/ |archive-date=13 March 2017 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Abhishek Bachchan]] as Sameer \"Sam\" Acharya \n* [[John Abraham]] as Kunal Chauhan \n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Neha Melwani\n* [[Bobby Deol]] as Abhimanyu \"Abhi\" Singh\n* [[Kirron Kher]] as Mrs. Acharya\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Ishita \"Ishu\" Melwani\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Murli \"M\"\n* Shrey Bawa as Veer Singh\n* [[Shilpa Shetty]] (cameo appearance in the song \"Shut Up & Bounce\")\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nDuring the production of ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), [[Tarun Mansukhani]] conceived a film about three friends who share an apartment.<ref name=\"nobash\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1081120/jsp/entertainment/story_10133869.jsp |title=\u2018There is no gay bashing\u2019 |last=Shah, Jigar |date=20 November 2008 |website=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313100401/https://www.telegraphindia.com/1081120/jsp/entertainment/story_10133869.jsp |archive-date=13 March 2017 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> After the production wrapped, [[Karan Johar]] told him that Mansukhani was ready to direct a film and should write a script; if Johar liked it, he would produce the film.<ref name=\"nobash\" /> He set the film in [[Miami]], since he liked its lifestyle and culture: \"People in Miami work hard and party harder and I wanted to capture that in my film.\"<ref name=\"act\">{{Cite web |url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/aug/26sli1.htm |title='Abhishek, John act gay in Dostana' |last=Ramani, Nithya |date=26 August 2008 |website=[[Rediff.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829055401/http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/aug/26sli1.htm |archive-date=29 August 2008 |access-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> Mansukhani worked for eight months on the script; Johar liked it, and asked him about the cast.<ref name=\"nobash\" /> In an interview, Manuskhani described ''Dostana'' as a story of \"how the three strangers come together, live together in an apartment and have their moments of happiness and sorrow.\"<ref name=\"act\" />\n\nThe director was inspired by his own experiences: \"The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends.

This is where new student Steven Karp ([[Jay Baruchel]]) takes his love interest Lizzie ([[Carla Gallo]]) on their first date. Karp tries to heckle Nugent during his speech in an attempt to impress Lizzie, with disastrous results. FOX didn't like the idea of Nugent and his political views appearing on this show, so the episode was re-shot and re-edited as \"Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend?\" which aired without any Ted Nugent content whatsoever.

This spelling variant has been copied often and may be found frequently.<!--What do these say? (Benz 2001; Seidel 2005)--> <!-- need source for middle name --></ref>\n\nDespite living in near poverty, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local [[Grammar School]] in Karlsruhe and was a [[child prodigy|prodigious]] student. In 1853, at the age of nine he started at the scientifically oriented [[Lyceum]]. Next he studied at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Poly-Technical University]] under the instruction of [[Ferdinand Redtenbacher]].\n\nBenz had originally focused his studies on [[locksmithing]], but he eventually followed his father's steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for mechanical engineering at the [[University of Karlsruhe]], which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated 9 July 1864 aged 19.\n\nFollowing his formal education, Benz had seven years of professional training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The [[training]] started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a mechanical engineering company.\n\nHe then moved to [[Mannheim]] to work as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and designer in a [[Weighing scale|scales]] factory. In 1868 he went to [[Pforzheim]] to work for a bridge building company ''Gebr\u00fcder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik''. Finally, he went to [[Vienna]] for a short period to work at an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron construction]] company.\n\n==Benz's first factory and early inventions (1871\u20131882)==\nIn 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Karl Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in [[Mannheim]], later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\">{{in lang|de}} [http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Karl Benz's life as described on daimler.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629163949/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |date=29 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe enterprise's first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business's tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz's fianc\u00e9e, [[Bertha Benz|Bertha Ringer]], bought out Ritter's share in the company using her [[dowry]].<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\" /><ref>[http://www.mbusa.com/heritage/karl-benz.do Mercedes-Benz, Home of Mercedes-Benz Luxury Automobiles<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.mbusa.com</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1872,{{cn|date=September 2019}} Karl Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).\n\nDespite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenues, in 1878 he began to work on new patents. First, he concentrated all his efforts on creating a reliable petrol [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]]. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, New Year's Eve, and was granted a patent for it in 28 June 1880.\n\nKarl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the [[accelerator (car)|speed regulation]] system, the [[ignition system|ignition]] using sparks with [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the [[spark plug]], the [[carburetor]], the [[clutch]], the [[gear shift]], and the water [[radiator]].\n\n==Benz's Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882\u20131883)==\nProblems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] due to the high production costs it maintained. The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with photographer Emil B\u00fchler and his brother (a cheese merchant), to get additional bank support. The company became the [[joint-stock company]] ''Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim'' in 1882.\n\nAfter all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the [[Share (finance)|shares]] and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.\n\n==Benz and Cie. and the Benz Patent Motorwagen==\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen 1886 (Replica).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Replica of the [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]] built in 1885]]\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=250 cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px gray solid; font-size:80%; background:#f9f9f9\"\n|+ <big>'''1885 [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]'''</big>\n| style=\"background:#efefef\" align=\"center\" colspan=2 |\n[[Image:1885Benz.jpg|250px|1885 Benz Tri-Car]]\n|-\n!align=left|Three wheels\n|-\n!align=left|Tubular steel frame\n|-\n!align=left|Rack and pinion steering, connected to a driver end tiller; wheel chained to front axle\n|-\n!align=left|Electric ignition\n|-\n!align=left|Differential rear end gears\n(mechanically operated inlet valves)\n|-\n!align=left|Water-cooled internal combustion engine\n|-\n!align=left|Gas or petrol four-stroke horizontally mounted engine\n|-\n!align=left|Single cylinder, Bore 116&nbsp;mm, Stroke 160&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!align=left|Patent model: 958 cc, 0.8&nbsp;hp, 16&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n!align=left|Commercialized model: 1600 cc, \u00be hp, 13&nbsp;km/h\n|}\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen Engine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engine of the Benz Patent Motorwagen]]\n[[File:Karl Benz F\u00fchrerschein.jpg|thumb|upright|An official license to operate the Benz Patent Motorwagen on the public roads was issued by Gro\u00dfherzoglich Badisches Bezirksamt on 1 August 1888]]\nBenz's lifelong [[hobby]] brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm E\u00dflinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: ''[[Benz & Cie.|Benz & Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik]]'', usually referred to as ''Benz & Cie.'' Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static [[gas engine]]s as well.\n\nThe success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a ''horseless carriage''. Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an [[automobile]]. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)\n<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)</ref> with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition<ref name=\"Georgano\">[[G.N. Georgano]]</ref> and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. Karl Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it \"''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]''\".\n\nIt was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized stage coach or horse carriage, which is why Karl Benz was granted his patent and is regarded as its inventor.\n\nThe Motorwagen was patented on 29 January 1886 as DRP-37435: \"automobile fueled by gas\".<ref>[http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf DRP's patent No. 37435] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045616/http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 561 kB, German) was filed 29 January 1886 and granted 2 November 1886, thus taking effect 29 January.</ref> The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration. The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886. The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1889, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year.<ref name=\"Georgano\" />\n\nBenz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as \"''Benz Patent Motorwagen''\") in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history. The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian bicycle manufacturer<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> [[Emile Roger]], who had already been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz for several years. Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there.\n\nThe early 1888 version of the Motorwagen had only two gears and could not climb hills unaided. This limitation was rectified after [[Bertha Benz]] made her famous trip driving one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of a third gear for climbing hills. In the course of this trip she also invented brake pads.\n\n==Bertha Benz's long-distance drive==\n[[Image:Motorwagen Serienversion.jpg|thumb|The Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 of 1888, used by [[Bertha Benz]] for the first long distance journey by automobile (more than 106 km or sixty miles)]]\n[[File:Berthabenzmemorialrouteschild.jpg|thumb|left|Official signpost of [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], commemorating the world's first long distance journey with a Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 in 1888]]\nThe world's first ever long distance automobile trip was undertaken by Bertha Benz using a Model 3. On the morning of 5 August 1888 Bertha \u2013 supposedly without the knowledge of her husband \u2013 took the vehicle on a {{convert|104|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her. In addition to having to locate pharmacies along the way to refuel, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems. One of these included the invention of [[brake lining]]; after some longer downhill slopes she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather onto the brake blocks. Bertha Benz and sons finally arrived at nightfall, announcing the achievement to Karl by [[telegram]]. It had been her intention to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Benz Motorwagen for travel and to generate publicity in the manner now referred to as live marketing. Today, the event is celebrated every two years in Germany with an antique automobile rally. \n\nIn 2008, the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bertha-Benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home |title=Bertha Benz Memorial Route}}</ref> was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's tracks of the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. The public can now follow the 194&nbsp;km of signposted route from Mannheim via [[Heidelberg]] to Pforzheim ([[Black Forest]]) and back. The return trip \u2013 which didn't go through Heidelberg \u2013 was along a different, slightly shorter route, as shown on the maps of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.\n\nBenz's Model 3 made its wide-scale debut to the world in the 1889 [[World's Fair]] in Paris; about twenty-five Motorwagens were built between 1886 and 1893.\n\n==Benz and Cie. expansion==\n[[Image:Karl Benz - early automobile logo w cog wheel - 83d40m.JPG|thumb|left|Early logo used on automobiles by Karl Benz]]\n[[Image:Benz Velo 1894.jpg|thumb|Karl Benz introduced the Velo in 1894, becoming the first ''production'' automobile]]\n[[Image:Bertha Benz with her husband Carl Benz in a Benz-Viktoria, model 1894.jpg|thumb|Bertha Benz with her husband Karl Benz in a Benz Viktoria, model 1894]]\n[[Image:Erste Benzin-Omnibus der Welt.jpg|thumb|First internal combustion engined bus in history: the Benz Omnibus, built in 1895 for the Netphener bus company]]\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:zzz-0309CogWheel1909laurel.jpg|thumb|Benz & Company logos: Cog wheel (1903 to 1909) and laureled (since 1909)]] -->\nThe great demand for static [[internal combustion engines]] forced Karl Benz to enlarge the factory in Mannheim, and in 1886 a new building located on Waldhofstrasse (operating until 1908) was added. ''Benz & Cie.'' had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899.\n\nDuring the last years of the nineteenth century, ''Benz'' was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899.\n\nBecause of its size, in 1899, ''Benz & Cie.'' became a [[joint-stock company]] with the arrival of Friedrich von Fischer and Julius Gan\u00df, who came aboard as members of the [[Board of directors|Board of Management]]. Gan\u00df worked in the commercialization department, which is somewhat similar to marketing in contemporary corporations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz.co.ke/content/kenya/mpc/mpc_kenya_website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/world/mythos/how_it_began.html |title=How it all began |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819021657/http://www.mercedes-benz.co.ke/content/kenya/mpc/mpc_kenya_website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/world/mythos/how_it_began.html |archive-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe new directors recommended that Benz should create a less expensive automobile suitable for [[mass production]]. In 1893, Karl Benz created the ''[[Benz Viktoria|Victoria]]'',<!--Is it spelled \"Viktoria\"?--> a two-passenger automobile with a {{convert|2.2|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, which could reach the top speed of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a [[lever|pivot]]al front [[axle]] operated by a [[roller chain|roller-chained]] [[tiller]] for [[steering]].

Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly called '''boxer''' engines, ''boxermotor'' in German, and also are known as ''horizontally opposed engines''.

In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, [[Wilhelm Maybach]], built the engine that would later be used in the  ''[[Mercedes 35hp|Mercedes-35hp]]'' of 1902. The engine was built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]] under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series. Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-''Mercedes'' (for his daughter). Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes. After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on 22 December 1900. Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902.\n\nBenz countered with ''Parsifil'', introduced in 1903 with a vertical twin engine that achieved a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}. Then, without consulting Benz, the other directors hired some French designers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsPublic/en/instance/ko/810-hp---35-hp-Benz-Parsifal-and-18-hp---3540-hp-Benz-1902--.xhtml?oid=4418 |title=8/10 hp \u2013 35 hp Benz Parsifal and 18 hp \u2013 35/40 hp Benz, 1902 \u2013 1908 \u2013 marsPublic}}</ref>\n\nFrance was a country with an extensive automobile industry based on Maybach's creations.

The brand name used the first initial of the French variant of Benz's first name, \"Carl\".\n\n==Blitzen Benz==\n[[Image:Blitzen Benz racing car.jpg|thumb|1909 ''Blitzen Benz''  \u2013 built by Benz & Cie., which held the [[land speed record]]]]\nIn 1909, the ''Blitzen Benz'' was built in Mannheim by Benz & Cie.

The ''Benz Sons'' automobiles were of good quality and became popular in London as [[taxicab|taxis]].\n\nIn 1912, Karl Benz liquidated all of his shares in Benz Sons and left the family-held company in Ladenburg to Eugen and Richard, but he remained as a director of Benz & Cie.\n\nDuring a birthday celebration for him in his home town of [[Karlsruhe]] on 25 November 1914, the seventy-year-old Karl Benz was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|doctorate]] by his alma mater, the ''[[Karlsruhe University]]'', thereby becoming\u2014Dr.&nbsp;Ing. h.&nbsp;c.&nbsp;Karl Benz.<ref name=\"automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/community/dr-carl-benz-car-museum/ |title=Dr. Carl Benz Car Museum.}}</ref>\n\nAlmost from the very beginning of the production of automobiles, participation in [[sports car racing]] became a major method to gain publicity for manufacturers. At first, the production models were raced and the Benz ''Velo'' participated in the first automobile race: [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen 1894]]. Later, investment in developing [[racecar]]s for [[motorsports]] produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners. Unique race vehicles were built at the time, as seen in the photograph here of the Benz, the first [[mid-engine]] and [[aerodynamically]] designed, ''Tropfenwagen'', a \"teardrop\" body introduced at the 1923 [[European Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].\n\nIn the last production year of the ''Benz Sons'' company, 1923, three hundred and fifty units were built. During the following year, 1924, Karl Benz built two additional 8/25&nbsp;hp units of the automobile manufactured by this company, tailored for his personal use, which he never sold; they are still preserved.\n\n==Toward Daimler-Benz and the first Mercedes-Benz in 1926==\n[[Image:Ladenburg Wohnhaus Carl Benz 20100920.jpg|thumb|Last home of Karl and Bertha Benz, now the location of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation in [[Ladenburg]], in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]]]\nThe German economic crisis worsened. In 1923 ''Benz & Cie.'' produced only 1,382 units in Mannheim, and ''DMG'' made only 1,020 in Stuttgart. The average cost of an automobile was 25&nbsp;million [[German papiermark|marks]] because of rapid inflation. Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an \"Agreement of Mutual Interest\" valid until the year 2000.

The name of that DMG model had been selected after ten-year-old [[Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Jellinek]], the daughter of [[Emil Jellinek]] who had set the specifications for the new model. Between 1900 and 1909 he was a member of DMG's board of management, however had resigned long before the merger.\n\nKarl Benz was a member of the new ''Daimler-Benz'' board of management for the remainder of his life. A new logo was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler's [[motto]]: ''\"engines for land, air, and water\"'') surrounded by traditional [[Bay Laurel|laurels]] from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]''. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.\n\nThe next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918 and the [[diesel engine|diesel]] line was launched for truck production. In 1928, the ''[[Mercedes-Benz SSK]]'' was presented.\n\nOn 4 April 1929, Karl Benz died at home in Ladenburg at the age of eighty-four from a [[bronchitis|bronchial inflammation]].

(Benz 2001; Seidel 2005)--> <!-- need source for middle name --></ref>\n\nDespite living in near poverty, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local [[Grammar School]] in Karlsruhe and was a [[child prodigy|prodigious]] student. In 1853, at the age of nine he started at the scientifically oriented [[Lyceum]]. Next he studied at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Poly-Technical University]] under the instruction of [[Ferdinand Redtenbacher]].\n\nBenz had originally focused his studies on [[locksmithing]], but he eventually followed his father's steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for mechanical engineering at the [[University of Karlsruhe]], which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated 9 July 1864 aged 19.\n\nFollowing his formal education, Benz had seven years of professional training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The [[training]] started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a mechanical engineering company.\n\nHe then moved to [[Mannheim]] to work as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and designer in a [[Weighing scale|scales]] factory. In 1868 he went to [[Pforzheim]] to work for a bridge building company ''Gebr\u00fcder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik''. Finally, he went to [[Vienna]] for a short period to work at an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron construction]] company.\n\n==Benz's first factory and early inventions (1871\u20131882)==\nIn 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Karl Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in [[Mannheim]], later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\">{{in lang|de}} [http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Karl Benz's life as described on daimler.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629163949/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |date=29 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe enterprise's first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business's tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz's fianc\u00e9e, [[Bertha Benz|Bertha Ringer]], bought out Ritter's share in the company using her [[dowry]].<ref name=\"benz-bio-daimler\" /><ref>[http://www.mbusa.com/heritage/karl-benz.do Mercedes-Benz, Home of Mercedes-Benz Luxury Automobiles<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.mbusa.com</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1872,{{cn|date=September 2019}} Karl Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).\n\nDespite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenues, in 1878 he began to work on new patents. First, he concentrated all his efforts on creating a reliable petrol [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]]. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, New Year's Eve, and was granted a patent for it in 28 June 1880.\n\nKarl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the [[accelerator (car)|speed regulation]] system, the [[ignition system|ignition]] using sparks with [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the [[spark plug]], the [[carburetor]], the [[clutch]], the [[gear shift]], and the water [[radiator]].\n\n==Benz's Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882\u20131883)==\nProblems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] due to the high production costs it maintained. The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with photographer Emil B\u00fchler and his brother (a cheese merchant), to get additional bank support. The company became the [[joint-stock company]] ''Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim'' in 1882.\n\nAfter all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the [[Share (finance)|shares]] and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.\n\n==Benz and Cie. and the Benz Patent Motorwagen==\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen 1886 (Replica).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Replica of the [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]] built in 1885]]\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=250 cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px gray solid; font-size:80%; background:#f9f9f9\"\n|+ <big>'''1885 [[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]'''</big>\n| style=\"background:#efefef\" align=\"center\" colspan=2 |\n[[Image:1885Benz.jpg|250px|1885 Benz Tri-Car]]\n|-\n!align=left|Three wheels\n|-\n!align=left|Tubular steel frame\n|-\n!align=left|Rack and pinion steering, connected to a driver end tiller; wheel chained to front axle\n|-\n!align=left|Electric ignition\n|-\n!align=left|Differential rear end gears\n(mechanically operated inlet valves)\n|-\n!align=left|Water-cooled internal combustion engine\n|-\n!align=left|Gas or petrol four-stroke horizontally mounted engine\n|-\n!align=left|Single cylinder, Bore 116&nbsp;mm, Stroke 160&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!align=left|Patent model: 958 cc, 0.8&nbsp;hp, 16&nbsp;km/h\n|-\n!align=left|Commercialized model: 1600 cc, \u00be hp, 13&nbsp;km/h\n|}\n[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen Engine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engine of the Benz Patent Motorwagen]]\n[[File:Karl Benz F\u00fchrerschein.jpg|thumb|upright|An official license to operate the Benz Patent Motorwagen on the public roads was issued by Gro\u00dfherzoglich Badisches Bezirksamt on 1 August 1888]]\nBenz's lifelong [[hobby]] brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm E\u00dflinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: ''[[Benz & Cie.|Benz & Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik]]'', usually referred to as ''Benz & Cie.'' Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static [[gas engine]]s as well.\n\nThe success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a ''horseless carriage''. Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an [[automobile]]. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)\n<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)</ref> with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition<ref name=\"Georgano\">[[G.N. Georgano]]</ref> and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. Karl Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it \"''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]''\".\n\nIt was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized stage coach or horse carriage, which is why Karl Benz was granted his patent and is regarded as its inventor.\n\nThe Motorwagen was patented on 29 January 1886 as DRP-37435: \"automobile fueled by gas\".<ref>[http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf DRP's patent No. 37435] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045616/http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 561 kB, German) was filed 29 January 1886 and granted 2 November 1886, thus taking effect 29 January.</ref> The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration. The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886. The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1889, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year.<ref name=\"Georgano\" />\n\nBenz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as \"''Benz Patent Motorwagen''\") in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history. The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian bicycle manufacturer<ref name=\"Georgano\" /> [[Emile Roger]], who had already been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz for several years. Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there.\n\nThe early 1888 version of the Motorwagen had only two gears and could not climb hills unaided. This limitation was rectified after [[Bertha Benz]] made her famous trip driving one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of a third gear for climbing hills. In the course of this trip she also invented brake pads.\n\n==Bertha Benz's long-distance drive==\n[[Image:Motorwagen Serienversion.jpg|thumb|The Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 of 1888, used by [[Bertha Benz]] for the first long distance journey by automobile (more than 106 km or sixty miles)]]\n[[File:Berthabenzmemorialrouteschild.jpg|thumb|left|Official signpost of [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], commemorating the world's first long distance journey with a Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 in 1888]]\nThe world's first ever long distance automobile trip was undertaken by Bertha Benz using a Model 3. On the morning of 5 August 1888 Bertha \u2013 supposedly without the knowledge of her husband \u2013 took the vehicle on a {{convert|104|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her. In addition to having to locate pharmacies along the way to refuel, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems. One of these included the invention of [[brake lining]]; after some longer downhill slopes she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather onto the brake blocks. Bertha Benz and sons finally arrived at nightfall, announcing the achievement to Karl by [[telegram]]. It had been her intention to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Benz Motorwagen for travel and to generate publicity in the manner now referred to as live marketing. Today, the event is celebrated every two years in Germany with an antique automobile rally. \n\nIn 2008, the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bertha-Benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home |title=Bertha Benz Memorial Route}}</ref> was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's tracks of the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. The public can now follow the 194&nbsp;km of signposted route from Mannheim via [[Heidelberg]] to Pforzheim ([[Black Forest]]) and back. The return trip \u2013 which didn't go through Heidelberg \u2013 was along a different, slightly shorter route, as shown on the maps of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.\n\nBenz's Model 3 made its wide-scale debut to the world in the 1889 [[World's Fair]] in Paris; about twenty-five Motorwagens were built between 1886 and 1893.\n\n==Benz and Cie. expansion==\n[[Image:Karl Benz - early automobile logo w cog wheel - 83d40m.JPG|thumb|left|Early logo used on automobiles by Karl Benz]]\n[[Image:Benz Velo 1894.jpg|thumb|Karl Benz introduced the Velo in 1894, becoming the first ''production'' automobile]]\n[[Image:Bertha Benz with her husband Carl Benz in a Benz-Viktoria, model 1894.jpg|thumb|Bertha Benz with her husband Karl Benz in a Benz Viktoria, model 1894]]\n[[Image:Erste Benzin-Omnibus der Welt.jpg|thumb|First internal combustion engined bus in history: the Benz Omnibus, built in 1895 for the Netphener bus company]]\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:zzz-0309CogWheel1909laurel.jpg|thumb|Benz & Company logos: Cog wheel (1903 to 1909) and laureled (since 1909)]] -->\nThe great demand for static [[internal combustion engines]] forced Karl Benz to enlarge the factory in Mannheim, and in 1886 a new building located on Waldhofstrasse (operating until 1908) was added. ''Benz & Cie.'' had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899.\n\nDuring the last years of the nineteenth century, ''Benz'' was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899.\n\nBecause of its size, in 1899, ''Benz & Cie.'' became a [[joint-stock company]] with the arrival of Friedrich von Fischer and Julius Gan\u00df, who came aboard as members of the [[Board of directors|Board of Management]].

In 1893, Karl Benz created the ''[[Benz Viktoria|Victoria]]'',<!--Is it spelled \"Viktoria\"?--> a two-passenger automobile with a {{convert|2.2|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, which could reach the top speed of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a [[lever|pivot]]al front [[axle]] operated by a [[roller chain|roller-chained]] [[tiller]] for [[steering]]. The model was successful with 85 units sold in 1893.\n\nThe Benz ''Velo'' also participated in the world's first automobile race, the 1894 [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]], where \u00c9mile Roger finished 14th, after covering the {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 hours 01-minute at an average speed of {{convert|12.7|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1895, Benz designed the first truck with an internal combustion engine in history.

It had horizontally opposed [[piston]]s, a design in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead centre simultaneously, thus balancing each other with respect to [[momentum]]. Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly called '''boxer''' engines, ''boxermotor'' in German, and also are known as ''horizontally opposed engines''. This design is still used by [[Porsche]], [[Subaru]], and some high performance engines used in [[racing cars]]. In motorcycles, the most famous boxer engine is found in [[BMW Motorrad]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.designboom.com/technology/90-years-of-bmw-motorrad-an-evolution-of-the-motorcycle/ |title=90 years of BMW motorrad: an evolution of the motorcycle |date=29 May 2013}}</ref> though the boxer engine design was used in many other models, including [[Victoria (motorcycle)|Victoria]], [[Harley-Davidson]] XA, [[Z\u00fcndapp]], [[History of BMW motorcycles|Wooler]], [[Douglas Dragonfly]], [[Ratier]], Universal, [[IMZ-Ural]], [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr]], [[Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Chang Jiang (motorcycle)|Chang Jiang]], [[Marusho]], and the [[Honda Gold Wing]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://carlbenz.idschools.kit.edu/history_of_carl_benz.php |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093827/http://carlbenz.idschools.kit.edu/history_of_carl_benz.php |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=4 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Gottlieb Daimler]] died in March 1900\u2014and there is no evidence that Benz and [[Gottlieb Daimler|Daimler]] knew each other nor that they knew about each other's early achievements\u2014eventually, competition with [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) in [[Stuttgart]] began to challenge the leadership of Benz & Cie. In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, [[Wilhelm Maybach]], built the engine that would later be used in the  ''[[Mercedes 35hp|Mercedes-35hp]]'' of 1902. The engine was built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]] under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series. Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-''Mercedes'' (for his daughter). Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes. After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on 22 December 1900. Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902.\n\nBenz countered with ''Parsifil'', introduced in 1903 with a vertical twin engine that achieved a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}. Then, without consulting Benz, the other directors hired some French designers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsPublic/en/instance/ko/810-hp---35-hp-Benz-Parsifal-and-18-hp---3540-hp-Benz-1902--.xhtml?oid=4418 |title=8/10 hp \u2013 35 hp Benz Parsifal and 18 hp \u2013 35/40 hp Benz, 1902 \u2013 1908 \u2013 marsPublic}}</ref>\n\nFrance was a country with an extensive automobile industry based on Maybach's creations. Because of this action, after difficult discussions, Karl Benz announced his retirement from design management on 24 January 1903, although he remained as director on the Board of Management through its merger with DMG in 1926 and, remained on the board of the new Daimler-Benz corporation until his death in 1929.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1984<ref name=\"Benz\">{{Cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/1675571_EAHoF_e.rtf |title=European Automotive Hall of Fame |publisher=[[Mercedes-Benz]] |access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AHF=Benz\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |title=Karl Benz |year=1984 |website=Hall of Fame Inductees |publisher=Automotive Hall of Fame |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308034830/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |archive-date=8 March 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> and the European Automotive Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"Benz\" />\n\nBenz's sons Eugen and Richard left Benz & Cie. in 1903, but Richard returned to the company in 1904 as the designer of passenger vehicles.\n\nThat year, sales of Benz & Cie. reached 3,480 automobiles, and the company remained the leading manufacturer of automobiles.\n\nAlong with continuing as a director of Benz & Cie., Karl Benz would soon found another company, ''C.&nbsp;Benz S\u00f6hne'', (with his son Eugen and closely held within the family), a privately held company for manufacturing automobiles. The brand name used the first initial of the French variant of Benz's first name, \"Carl\".\n\n==Blitzen Benz==\n[[Image:Blitzen Benz racing car.jpg|thumb|1909 ''Blitzen Benz''  \u2013 built by Benz & Cie., which held the [[land speed record]]]]\nIn 1909, the ''Blitzen Benz'' was built in Mannheim by Benz & Cie. The bird-beaked vehicle had a 21.5-liter (1312ci), {{convert|150|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, and on 9 November 1909 in the hands of [[Victor H\u00e9mery]] of France,<ref>Northey, Tom, \"Land Speed Record\", in ''The World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis Publishing, 1974), Volume 10, p.1163.</ref> the [[land speed record|land speed racer]] at [[Brooklands]], set a record of 226.91&nbsp;km/h (141.94&nbsp;mph), said to be \"faster than any plane, train, or automobile\" at the time, a record that was not exceeded for ten years by any other vehicle. It was transported to several countries, including the United States, to establish multiple records of this achievement.\n\n==Benz S\u00f6hne (1906\u20131923)==\n[[Image:Benz Logo Mannheim.png|thumb|upright|left|Logo with laurels used on Benz & Cie automobiles after 1909]]\n[[Image:Benz & Cie 1912 1000 Mk.jpg|thumb|upright|bond of the Benz & Cie, issued 1912]]\n[[Image:Patentmotorwagen mit Karl und Bertha Benz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Karl and Bertha Benz c.&nbsp;1926 (collection of Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH)]]\n\nKarl Benz, Bertha Benz, and their son, Eugen, moved {{convert|10|km}} east of Mannheim to live in nearby [[Ladenburg]], and solely with their own capital, founded the private company, C.&nbsp;Benz Sons (German: ''Benz S\u00f6hne'') in 1906, producing automobiles and gas engines. The latter type was replaced by petrol engines because of lack of demand.<ref name=\"automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de/?section=historie&infopart=drcarlbenz |title=Automuseum Dr. Carl Benz}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:C-Benz-Soehne-Logo.png|thumb|upright|Logo on family held business production vehicles]]\nThis company never issued stocks publicly, building its own line of automobiles independently from Benz & Cie., which was located in Mannheim. The ''Benz Sons'' automobiles were of good quality and became popular in London as [[taxicab|taxis]].\n\nIn 1912, Karl Benz liquidated all of his shares in Benz Sons and left the family-held company in Ladenburg to Eugen and Richard, but he remained as a director of Benz & Cie.\n\nDuring a birthday celebration for him in his home town of [[Karlsruhe]] on 25 November 1914, the seventy-year-old Karl Benz was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|doctorate]] by his alma mater, the ''[[Karlsruhe University]]'', thereby becoming\u2014Dr.&nbsp;Ing. h.&nbsp;c.&nbsp;Karl Benz.<ref name=\"automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/community/dr-carl-benz-car-museum/ |title=Dr. Carl Benz Car Museum.}}</ref>\n\nAlmost from the very beginning of the production of automobiles, participation in [[sports car racing]] became a major method to gain publicity for manufacturers. At first, the production models were raced and the Benz ''Velo'' participated in the first automobile race: [[Paris\u2013Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen 1894]]. Later, investment in developing [[racecar]]s for [[motorsports]] produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners. Unique race vehicles were built at the time, as seen in the photograph here of the Benz, the first [[mid-engine]] and [[aerodynamically]] designed, ''Tropfenwagen'', a \"teardrop\" body introduced at the 1923 [[European Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].\n\nIn the last production year of the ''Benz Sons'' company, 1923, three hundred and fifty units were built. During the following year, 1924, Karl Benz built two additional 8/25&nbsp;hp units of the automobile manufactured by this company, tailored for his personal use, which he never sold; they are still preserved.\n\n==Toward Daimler-Benz and the first Mercedes-Benz in 1926==\n[[Image:Ladenburg Wohnhaus Carl Benz 20100920.jpg|thumb|Last home of Karl and Bertha Benz, now the location of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation in [[Ladenburg]], in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]]]\nThe German economic crisis worsened. In 1923 ''Benz & Cie.'' produced only 1,382 units in Mannheim, and ''DMG'' made only 1,020 in Stuttgart. The average cost of an automobile was 25&nbsp;million [[German papiermark|marks]] because of rapid inflation. Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an \"Agreement of Mutual Interest\" valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising\u2014marketing their automobile models jointly\u2014although keeping their respective brands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Merger-in-the-Year-1926-DMG-and-Benz--Cie-merge-to-become-Da.xhtml?oid=12358477 |title=Merger in the Year 1926: DMG and Benz & Cie. merge to become Daimler-Benz AG: Together for the best for 90 years \u2013 marsMediaSite}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the ''[[Daimler-Benz]]'' company, baptizing all of its automobiles, ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'', honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]'', along with the Benz name. The name of that DMG model had been selected after ten-year-old [[Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Jellinek]], the daughter of [[Emil Jellinek]] who had set the specifications for the new model. Between 1900 and 1909 he was a member of DMG's board of management, however had resigned long before the merger.\n\nKarl Benz was a member of the new ''Daimler-Benz'' board of management for the remainder of his life. A new logo was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler's [[motto]]: ''\"engines for land, air, and water\"'') surrounded by traditional [[Bay Laurel|laurels]] from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]''. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.\n\nThe next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918 and the [[diesel engine|diesel]] line was launched for truck production. In 1928, the ''[[Mercedes-Benz SSK]]'' was presented.\n\nOn 4 April 1929, Karl Benz died at home in Ladenburg at the age of eighty-four from a [[bronchitis|bronchial inflammation]]. Until her death on 5 May 1944, [[Bertha Benz]] continued to reside in their last home. Members of the family resided in the home for thirty more years. The Benz home now has been designated as [[historic preservation|historic]] and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the ''Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation'', that honors both Bertha and Karl Benz for their roles in the history of automobiles.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (1).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (2).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (3).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (4).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Memorial (5).jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim (2015)\nCarl-Benz-Denkmal (1) 2015.jpg|The Carl Benz monument in Mannheim, in the evening (2015)\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 2011, a dramatized television movie about the life of Karl and Bertha Benz was made named ''Carl & Bertha'' which premiered on 11 May<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://www.swr.de/carlundbertha Genialer T\u00fcftler und bedingungslose Unterst\u00fctzerin], [[S\u00fcdwestrundfunk|SWR]]</ref> and was aired by [[Das Erste]] on 23 May.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753569/ |title=Carl & Bertha (TV Movie 2011) |date=25 May 2011 |publisher=IMDb}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://programm.daserste.de/pages/programm/detail.aspx?id=30C8FA62CEBE516F83D1AE6F7AE2B2C0 ARD-Themenwoche \"Der mobile Mensch\" Carl & Bertha]</ref> A trailer of the movie<ref>{{in lang|de}} {{YouTube|gS9_XyEwyI4|Carl & Bertha \u2013 Eine Liebe f\u00fcr das Automobil \u2013 SWR \u2013 DAS ERSTE}}</ref> and a \"making of\" special were released on YouTube.<ref>{{YouTube|yHIFE4vOeEo|Making of 'Carl & Bertha' (Film)}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Benz (unit)]]\n*[[German inventors and discoverers]]\n*[[History of the internal combustion engine]]\n*[[Siegfried Marcus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |title=Lebensfahrt eines deutschen Erfinders : meine Erinnerungen / Karl Benz |last=Benz |first=Carl |publisher=Koehler und Amelang |year=2001 |isbn=3-7338-0302-7 |location=M\u00fcnchen |language=de}} (autobiography)[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027082313/http://geocities.com/MotorCity/Lane/4444/]\n:''The life of a German inventor: my memories / Karl Benz''\n*{{Cite book |title=Lebensfahrt eines deutschen erfinders; erinnerungen eines achtzigjahrigen |last=Benz |first=Carl Friedrich |publisher=Koehler & Amelang |year=c. 1925 |location=Leipzig |language=de}} (first edition) ([http://catnyp.nypl.org/record=b3903459 bibrec]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})\n:''The life of a German inventor; memories of an octogenarian''\n*Elis, Angela: ''Mein Traum ist l\u00e4nger als die Nacht.

Sleeping on doorsteps when the weather is fair, in empty hogsheads during storms, and living off of what he receives from others, Huck lives the life of a destitute [[vagabond]]. The author metaphorically names him \"the juvenile pariah of the village\" and describes Huck as \"idle, and lawless, and vulgar, and bad\", qualities for which he was admired by all the other children in the village, although their mothers \"cordially hated and dreaded\" him.\n\nHuck is an archetypal innocent, able to discover the \"right\" thing to do despite the prevailing theology and prejudiced mentality of [[Southern United States|the South]] of that era. The best example of this is his decision to help [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]] escape [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], even though he believes he will go to [[Hell]] for it (see [[Christian views on slavery]]).\n\nHis appearance is described in ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer''. He wears the clothes of full-grown men which he probably received as charity, and as Twain describes him, \"he was fluttering with rags.\" He has a torn, broken hat and his trousers are supported with only one suspender. Even Tom Sawyer, the St. Petersburg hamlet boys' leader sees him as \"the banished Romantic\".\n\nTom's Aunt Polly calls Huck a \"poor motherless thing.\" Huck confesses to Tom in ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' that he remembers his mother and his parents' relentless fighting that stopped only when she died.\n\nHuck has a [[bohemianism|carefree life]] free from societal norms or rules, stealing watermelons and chickens and \"borrowing (stealing)\" boats and cigars. Due to his unconventional childhood, Huck has received almost no education. At the end of ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'', Huck is adopted by the Widow Douglas, who sends him to school in return for his saving her life. In the course of ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' he learns enough to be literate and even reads books for entertainment. His knowledge of history as related to Jim is wildly inaccurate, but it is not specified if he is being wrong on purpose as a joke on Jim.\n\nIn ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'', the sequel to ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'', the Widow attempts to \"sivilize\" [''sic''] the newly wealthy Huck. Huck's father takes him from her, but Huck manages to fake his own death and escape to Jackson's Island, where he coincidentally meets up with Jim, a slave who was owned by the Widow Douglas' sister, Miss Watson.\n\nJim is running away because he overheard Miss Watson planning to \"sell him South\" for eight hundred dollars. Jim wants to escape to [[Cairo, Illinois]], where he can find work to eventually buy his family's freedom. Huck and Jim take a raft down the [[Mississippi River]], planning to head north on the [[Ohio River]], in hopes of finding freedom from slavery for Jim and freedom from Pap for Huck. Their adventures together, along with Huck's solo adventures, comprise the core of the book.\n\nIn the end, however, Jim gains his freedom through Miss Watson's death, as she freed him in her will. Pap, it is revealed, has died in Huck's absence, and although he could safely return to St. Petersburg, Huck plans to flee west to [[Indian Territory]].\n\nIn ''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'', the sequels to ''Huck Finn'', however, Huck is living in St. Petersburg again after the events of his eponymous novel. In ''Abroad'', Huck joins Tom and Jim for a wild, fanciful balloon ride that takes them overseas. In ''Detective'', which occurs about a year after the events of ''Huck Finn'', Huck helps Tom solve a murder mystery.\n\n==Relationships==\nHuck is [[Tom Sawyer]]'s closest friend. Their friendship is partially rooted in Sawyer's emulation of Huck's freedom and ability to do what he wants, like swearing and smoking when he feels like it. In one moment in the novel, he openly brags to his teacher that he was late for school because he stopped to talk with Huck Finn and enjoyed it, something for which he knew he would (and did) receive a whipping. Nonetheless, Tom remains a devoted friend to Huck in all of the novels they appear in. In Huckleberry Finn, it's revealed that Huck also considers Tom to be his best friend. At various times in the novel, Huck mentions that Tom would put more \"style\" in Jim and his adventure.\n\n[[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]], a runaway slave whom Huck befriends, is another dominant force in Huck's life. He is the symbol for the moral awakening Huck undergoes throughout ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''. This is seen when Huck considers sending a letter to Ms. Watson telling her where Jim is but ultimately chooses to rip it up despite the idea in the south that one who tries helping a slave escape will be sent to eternal punishment.\n\n[[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Pap Finn|Pap Finn]] is Huck's abusive, drunken father who shows up at the beginning of ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' and forcibly takes his son to live with him. Pap's only method of parenting is physical abuse. Although he seems derisive of education and civilized living, Pap seems to be jealous of Huck and is infuriated that his son would try to amount to more, and live in better conditions than he did. Despite this, early in the novel Huck uses his father's method of \"borrowing\" though he later feels sorry and stops.\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe character of Huck Finn is based on Tom Blankenship, the real-life son of a sawmill laborer and sometime drunkard named Woodson Blankenship, who lived in a \"ramshackle\" house near the Mississippi River behind the house where the author grew up in [[Hannibal, Missouri]].<ref>(Washington, D.C.)''

He was the only really independent person\u2014boy or man\u2014in the community, and by consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy and envied by the rest of us.

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand RG-28 (perforated).svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R2-4 (perforated).svgFile name standardisation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}
