He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 when he published ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and more than fifty short stories about Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].\n\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.\n\n== Name ==\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of \"Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 20\u201321). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as \"A. Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009).

Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms at the classes in Vienna and quickly quit his studies there.

The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]] who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in [[Great Wyrley]]. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Bardes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D.

In Nicholas Meyer's pastiche ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy [[Parsi]] Indian character wronged by the English justice system. Edalji was of Parsi heritage on his father's side. The story was fictionalised in [[Julian Barnes]]'s 2005 novel ''[[Arthur and George]]'', which was adapted into a three-part drama by ITV in 2015.\n\nThe second case, that of [[Oscar Slater]], a Jew of German origin who operated a gambling-den, convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in 1908, excited Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was not guilty.

He was initiated as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] (26 January 1887) at the Phoenix Lodge No. 257 in Southsea. He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, but returned to it in 1902, only to resign again in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html|title=Arthur Conan Doyle, Spiritualist and Freemason|last=Beresiner|first=Yasha|date=2007|work=Masonic papers|publisher=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309065258/http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html|archive-date=9 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlso in Southsea in 1887, influenced by a member of the Portsmouth Literary and Philosophical Society, Major-General [[Alfred Wilks Drayson]], he began a series of psychic investigations. These included attending around 20 [[seance]]s, experiments in [[telepathy]] and sittings with mediums. Writing to [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] journal ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'', that year, he declared himself to be a Spiritualist and spoke of one particular psychic event that had convinced him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wingett |first=Matt |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887\u20131920 |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=19\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThough he later wavered, he remained fascinated by the [[paranormal]].

''The New Revelation'' was the title of his first Spiritualist work, published two years later. In the intervening years, he wrote to ''Light'' magazine about his faith and lectured frequently on the truth of Spiritualism.\n\nWar-related deaths close to him certainly strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication, though it is wrong to claim that the death of his son, Kingsley, turned him to Spiritualism, as is often stated. Doyle came out as a Spiritualist to the public in 1916, a full two years before his son's death.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was on 28 October 1918 that Kingsley died from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

W. Hornung]], creator of the literary character [[A. J. Raffles|Raffles]]) and his two nephews also died shortly after the war. His second book on Spiritualism, ''[[The Vital Message]]'', appeared in 1919.\n\nDoyle found solace supporting spiritualism and its attempts to find proof of [[Afterlife|existence beyond the grave]]. In particular, according to some,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Did Conan Doyle Go Too Far? |journal=Psychic News|first=Leslie|last=Price|issue=4037|year=2010}}</ref> he favoured [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualism]] and encouraged the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to accept an eighth precept \u2013 that of following the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth.

Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers\u2014a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''. Houdini was apparently unable to convince Doyle that his feats were simply illusions, leading to a bitter public falling out between the two.<ref>[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003).

He was initially not considered the perpetrator of the hoax because it was seen as too elaborate for him. DNA evidence, however, showed that the tooth discovered in 1915 by Charles Dawson at an entirely different site came from the same jaw as the original skull and jawbone of the Piltdown Man, suggesting he had planted them both. The tooth discovered in 1915 has also since been proven to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man|title=Piltdown Man|website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nDr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \u201cConan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition. He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE.

He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 when he published ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and more than fifty short stories about Sherlock Holmes and [[Dr. James Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].\n\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.\n\n== Name ==\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of \"Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 20\u201321). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as \"A. Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009).

Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms at the classes in Vienna and quickly quit his studies there. For the rest of his two-month stay in Vienna, he pursued other activities, such as [[ice skating]] with his wife Louisa and drinking with Brinsley Richards of the London ''Times''.

''The New Revelation'' was the title of his first Spiritualist work, published two years later. In the intervening years, he wrote to ''Light'' magazine about his faith and lectured frequently on the truth of Spiritualism.\n\nWar-related deaths close to him certainly strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication, though it is wrong to claim that the death of his son, Kingsley, turned him to Spiritualism, as is often stated. Doyle came out as a Spiritualist to the public in 1916, a full two years before his son's death.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was on 28 October 1918 that Kingsley died from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers\u2014a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''.

DNA evidence, however, showed that the tooth discovered in 1915 by Charles Dawson at an entirely different site came from the same jaw as the original skull and jawbone of the Piltdown Man, suggesting he had planted them both. The tooth discovered in 1915 has also since been proven to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man|title=Piltdown Man|website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nDr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \u201cConan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition.

In August 2019, the [[Imperial War Museum]] announced plans to spend over \u00a330m on a new set of galleries over two floors at its London site covering the Holocaust and its importance in World War II. The galleries are set to open in 2021 and will replace the existing permanent Holocaust exhibition. The [[Imperial War Museum]] was also a suggested site for the planned Holocaust memorial.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/imperial-war-museums-30m-plan-to-show-how-holocaust-shaped-war-r30k5c33f|title=Imperial War Museums \u00a330m plan to show how Holocaust shaped watitle-imperial-war-museums-30m-plan-to-show-how-holocaust-shaped-war|last1=Morrison|first1=Jonathan|last2=Burgess|first2=Kaya|date=3 September 2019|accessdate=3 September 2019|newspaper=The Times}}</ref>\n\n== Location ==\nIn January 2015, [[David Cameron]] announced on behalf of the Holocaust Memorial Foundation that there was to be a new UK Holocaust Memorial and associated Learning Centre built in central London. At that stage, three particular sites were proposed: the Imperial War Museum (IWM), near [[City Hall, London|London City Hall]], and the [[Millbank Tower]] podium. The Imperial War Museum was embarking on a renewal of its existing Holocaust galleries and saw an excellent opportunity to achieve all the goals of the Holocaust Commission, not least the education of this and future generations. The IWM commissioned a design from the architects [[Foster and Partners|Foster + Partners]], which included a memorial garden, underground contemplation space and wall of remembrance, with the option of an underground extension to the existing Learning Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/aj-uncovers-fosters-unbuilt-holocaust-memorial-designs-for-imperial-war-museum/10024323.article?search=https%3a%2f%2fwww.architectsjournal.co.uk%2fsearcharticles%3fqsearch%3d1%26keywords%3duk+holocaust+memorial|title=AJ uncovers Foster\u2019s unbuilt Holocaust Memorial designs for Imperial War Museum|date=October 2017|website=Architects' Journal}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the UKHMF wished to mount an architectural competition and regarded the IWM, less than one mile from the Houses of Parliament, as not being in Central London, so the IWM offer was turned down. Instead they undertook a search of over fifty locations and, in July 2016, it was announced that Victoria Tower Gardens, the smallest of London's [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]], had been chosen for both the memorial and underground learning centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/bazalgette-holocaust-memorial-should-make-a-powerful-statement/10011971.article?search=https%3a%2f%2fwww.architectsjournal.co.uk%2fsearcharticles%3fqsearch%3d1%26keywords%3dpeter+bazalgette|title=Bazalgette: Holocaust Memorial Should Make a Powerful Statement|date=September 2016|website=Architects' Journal}}</ref>\n\nVictoria Tower Gardens is a public park along the north bank of the [[River Thames]] in [[London]].

The project design team intends the project to be contextualised among these other memorials,<ref name=\"UKGovOct17\" /><ref name=\"TimesOct17\" /> but campaigners who oppose the destruction of parkland have objected that the Holocaust memorial is vastly different, in scale and nature, to the existing memorials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/05/britain-holocaust-memorial-shortlist-victoria-tower-gardens-london|title=The Guardian|last=Moore|first=Rowan|date=February 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe park is also home to a small children's playground and often plays host to temporary cultural events including the light installation ''[[Spectra (installation)|spectra,]]'' by Japanese artist [[Ryoji Ikeda]], which commemorated the centenary of the start of the [[First World War]], and outdoor film screenings.

The Memorial consists of 23 bronze fins, with the gaps between the fins representing the 22 countries where the Holocaust destroyed Jewish communities, and acting as separate paths down to a hall named the 'Threshold' leading into the Learning Centre, along with a \"contemplation court\" and \"hall of testimonies\".<ref name=\"UKGovOct17\" /> A public consultation on the latest designs was held on 4\u20138 September 2018.

Many authoritative bodies have replied. Several very critical comments by respected international and UK organisations sparked widespread media coverage in the British press.

competed in the [[Football League Third Division]].\n\n==Season summary==\nIn the 1996-97 season, Hartlepool started the campaign with wins over [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], but Houchen's playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], when he retired due to a persistent knee injury.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=222}}</ref> Houchen continued to bemoan referring decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=224}}</ref> This in turn led to continued punishments from the [[the Football Association|FA]] over his use of foul language towards officials.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=226}}</ref> With Hartlepool on a poor run of results at the foot of the table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996.<ref name=\"page 232\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=232}}</ref> His assistant [[Mick Tait]] led the club to a 20th-place finish, and organised a benefit match for Houchen against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], which raised \u00a323,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=236}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a change of ownership in 1997, when Harold Hornsey sold the club to an oil company called IOR.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1996\u201397 Football League}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:
