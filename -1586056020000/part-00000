The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=13}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The earliest recorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Uruk]] in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The ancient [[Hittites]] and [[Assyria]]ns had massive archives containing records written in many different languages.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in [[Nineveh]], founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] (ruled 668\u2013{{circa}} 627 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} A large library also existed in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ({{circa}} 605\u2013{{circa}} 562 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} In Greece, the Athenian tyrant [[Peisistratos]] was said to have founded the first major public library in the sixth century BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1}} It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}\n\nThe Macedonian kings who succeeded [[Alexander the Great]] as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2\u20133}} Historian [[Roy MacLeod]] calls this \"a programme of [[cultural imperialism]]\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}} These rulers, therefore, had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2\u20133}} Libraries enhanced a city's prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=341}} Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=340}} The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies' ambitions;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|pages=340\u2013341}} unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all

details about it are a mixture of history and legend.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1\u20132}} The earliest known surviving source of information on the founding of the Library of Alexandria is the [[pseudepigraphic]] ''[[Letter of Aristeas]]'', which was composed between {{circa}} 180 and {{circa}} 145 BC.<ref name=\"Lindberg1980\" />{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} The ''Letter of Aristeas'' claims that the Library was founded during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] ({{circa}} 323\u2013{{circa}} 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], a student of [[Aristotle]] who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}<ref>''Letter of

instead created under the reign of Ptolemy I's son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (283\u2013246 BC).{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}\n\nModern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and [[Theophrastus]], which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the [[Peripatetic school]].{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=344\u2013345}}\n\nThe Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) as part of the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]].{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis|2015|p=19}}{{efn|\"Mouseion\" means \"House of Muses\", whence the term \"museum\".<ref>Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912160936/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 |date=12 September 2007 }} at [[Liddell & Scott]].</ref>}} Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,<ref name=\"Lindberg1980\">{{cite book|author=David C.

large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a [[:wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, \"community\").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}\n\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n[[File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration showing a portion of the globe

medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the

brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170\u2013{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek

twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the

The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a

numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a

325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of

appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n[[File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration showing a portion of the globe

is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the [[Battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with [[Upper Egypt]] became largely disrupted.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}\n\n[[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] (lived {{circa}} 216\u2013{{circa}} 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full ''[[hypomnema]]ta'', or long, free-standing commentaries, on them.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} A portion of one of Aristarchus's commentaries on the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] has survived in a papyrus fragment.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported [[Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator]] as the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}} Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of [[Cyprus]], where he died shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern

brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170\u2013{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek grammar]], a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the first century BC by [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] ({{circa}} 100\u2013{{circa}} 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}\n\n=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===\n[[File:C\u00e9sar

''History of Chicago, Volume 3'', Chicago, IL: The A T Andreas Company Publishers, pg. 776, 1886.</ref> Bishop Thomas Foley appointed Rev. Michael Lyons to organize the new parish. Father Lyons purchased the J. McPherson Livery Stables at the northeast corner of Halsted and Egan (39th Street), which was at that time the southern border of the City of Chicago.  The new parish was appropriately named \"Nativity Church,\" since Christ was also born in a stable.  It was dedicated on Palm Sunday, April 5, 1868.<ref>Flaherty, Reverend James J. ''Souvenir Book, Golden Jubilee'' Mission Press, pg. 10, 1919.</ref> The parish grew and Rev. Jeremiah S. O'Neill was named to succeed Father Lyons. With the support of the parish, he acquired 15 lots at the corner of 37th and Dashiel (now Union Avenue) to construct the present church.<ref>O'Brien, Reverend Edward P. ''Nativity of Our Lord Centennial Celebration'', Chicago, IL: Allied Press, pg. 39, 1979.</ref>\n\nIn 1874, Reverend Joseph M. Cartan was named pastor and quickly set about the work of building a greater parish and improving the lives of those who lived in Bridgeport. Father Cartan laid the cornerstone for the current church in 1876. Construction continued at a slow and steady pace. It was not until almost three years later that the lower church hall was finished sufficiently to hold services. On December 5, 1885, over nine years after the cornerstone was laid, Archbishop Patrick Feehan dedicated Nativity of Our Lord Church. It was not until the following summer that decorating and final construction details were completed. The cost of the church was reported at $70,000.<ref>Ed. by Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Koenig, S.T.D. ''A History of the Parishes of Archdiocese of Chicago'', Chicago, IL: The New World Publishing Company, pp. 654 - 656, 1981.</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church was designed by [[Patrick Keely]], who was a prolific designer contributing to over 600 churches in the United States.<ref name=keely>{{cite web|url=http://www.keelysociety.com/patrick.htm |title=Patrick Keely |publisher=Keely Society |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref> Other notable works by Keely include [[Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago|Holy Name Cathedral]] in Chicago, [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|The Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame University]] and the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston]].<ref name=keely/>\n\n== Stained glass ==\n[[File:Nativity Chicago Main Entrance Stained Glass.jpg|thumb|220px|Nativity Chicago Main Entrance Stained Glass]]\n[[File:Stained glass insets.gif|thumb|220px|Stained glass insets]]\nIntegral to the beauty and warmth of Nativity is the warm, muted light that bathes the interior of the church. Over 185 stained glass windows provide beauty and illumination. Every fa\u00e7ade contains stained glass. The fact that the church is intimate and inviting in spite of its considerable mass is due in large part to the warmth these windows bring.\n\nChurch records indicate that the current windows were installed in 1907 under the direction of then pastor Rev. James J. Flaherty.<ref>Ed. By Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Koenig, S.T.D. ''A History of the Parishes of Archdiocese of Chicago'', Chicago, IL: The New World Publishing Company, pg. 657, 1981.</ref> The windows can be divided into three primary sets: the nave windows lining the east and west walls of the church, the three windows above the narthex and the windows above the three front entrances. There are dozens of additional windows in the sacristy, the bell tower, and throughout the church. The windows are constructed with gothic patterns that show art nouveau influences. Most major panels have a unique round inset that features a classic, [[Munich-style stained glass]] with a religious symbol.\n\nThrough the generosity of many parishioners, these 168 heavenly and historic windows were restored to their original grandeur in 2010-2011, as the final phase of a five-year parish improvement process.\n\n== Pastors ==\n* Rev.

He also designed Holy Name Cathedral in downtown Chicago.<ref name=keely/>\n\nNativity of Our Lord Parish is part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] and is located in the city's [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] neighborhood. Prominent church members include former Chicago Mayors [[Richard J. Daley]] and [[Richard M. Daley]], as well as [[William M. Daley]], former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Chief of Staff for the Obama Administration, and former State Senator and Representative and current Cook County Commissioner [[John P.

''History of Chicago, Volume 3'', Chicago, IL: The A T Andreas Company Publishers, pg. 776, 1886.</ref> Bishop Thomas Foley appointed Rev. Michael Lyons to organize the new parish. Father Lyons purchased the J. McPherson Livery Stables at the northeast corner of Halsted and Egan (39th Street), which was at that time the southern border of the City of Chicago.  The new parish was appropriately named \"Nativity Church,\" since Christ was also born in a stable.  It was dedicated on Palm Sunday, April 5, 1868.<ref>Flaherty, Reverend James J. ''Souvenir Book, Golden Jubilee'' Mission Press, pg. 10, 1919.</ref> The parish grew and Rev. Jeremiah S. O'Neill was named to succeed Father Lyons. With the support of the parish, he acquired 15 lots at the corner of 37th and Dashiel (now Union Avenue) to construct the present church.<ref>O'Brien, Reverend Edward P. ''Nativity of Our Lord Centennial Celebration'', Chicago, IL: Allied Press, pg. 39, 1979.</ref>\n\nIn 1874, Reverend Joseph M. Cartan was named pastor and quickly set about the work of building a greater parish and improving the lives of those who lived in Bridgeport. Father Cartan laid the cornerstone for the current church in 1876. Construction continued at a slow and steady pace. It was not until almost three years later that the lower church hall was finished sufficiently to hold services. On December 5, 1885, over nine years after the cornerstone was laid, Archbishop Patrick Feehan dedicated Nativity of Our Lord Church. It was not until the following summer that decorating and final construction details were completed. The cost of the church was reported at $70,000.<ref>Ed. by Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Koenig, S.T.D. ''A History of the Parishes of Archdiocese of Chicago'', Chicago, IL: The New World Publishing Company, pp. 654 - 656, 1981.</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church was designed by [[Patrick Keely]], who was a prolific designer contributing to over 600 churches in the United States.<ref name=keely>{{cite web|url=http://www.keelysociety.com/patrick.htm |title=Patrick Keely |publisher=Keely Society |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref> Other notable works by Keely include [[Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago|Holy Name Cathedral]] in Chicago, [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|The Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame University]] and the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston]].<ref name=keely/>\n\n== Stained glass ==\n[[File:Nativity Chicago Main Entrance Stained Glass.jpg|thumb|220px|Nativity Chicago Main Entrance Stained Glass]]\n[[File:Stained glass insets.gif|thumb|220px|Stained glass insets]]\nIntegral to the beauty and warmth of Nativity is the warm, muted light that bathes the interior of the church. Over 185 stained glass windows provide beauty and illumination. Every fa\u00e7ade contains stained glass. The fact that the church is intimate and inviting in spite of its considerable mass is due in large part to the warmth these windows bring.\n\nChurch records indicate that the current windows were installed in 1907 under the direction of then pastor Rev. James J. Flaherty.<ref>Ed. By Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Koenig, S.T.D. ''A History of the Parishes of Archdiocese of Chicago'', Chicago, IL: The New World Publishing Company, pg. 657, 1981.</ref> The windows can be divided into three primary sets: the nave windows lining the east and west walls of the church, the three windows above the narthex and the windows above the three front entrances. There are dozens of additional windows in the sacristy, the bell tower, and throughout the church. The windows are constructed with gothic patterns that show art nouveau influences. Most major panels have a unique round inset that features a classic, [[Munich-style stained glass]] with a religious symbol.\n\nThrough the generosity of many parishioners, these 168 heavenly and historic windows were restored to their original grandeur in 2010-2011, as the final phase of a five-year parish improvement process.\n\n== Pastors ==\n* Rev.

Early innovative artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Wiley were able to take the strong thumping drums of [[drum and bass]], lyricism and vocal styles of [[UK garage]] and alter some of the rhythms of [[dancehall]] to capture all three genre's essences and add a new half-time, down-tempo dimension to the mix. The genre's popularity grew exponentially in the United Kingdom, as people across the scene's musical spectrum appreciated grime's eclectic mix of instrumentation and subcultures. This hybridisation united many different music scenes, allowing for it to spread in the same word-of-mouth and mixtape-based style as hip-hop, yet still appeal to fans of electronic music. It also paved the way for more electronic music artists to incorporate stronger Jamaican influence in the future. grime never received the same attention worldwide that it did in the UK. Much like many other less mainstream forms of British electronic music, its main scene and fan base remained in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlthough grime is recognised as a creative and innovative musical style,<ref name=\"pay2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3299204|title=will grime pay?|last=Collins|first=Hattie|date=19 November 2004|work=[[Collective (BBC)|Collective]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227170824/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3299204|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> there are other contributing factors to its rapid and widespread growth in popularity.

Early innovative artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Wiley were able to take the strong thumping drums of [[drum and bass]], lyricism and vocal styles of [[UK garage]] and alter some of the rhythms of [[dancehall]] to capture all three genre's essences and add a new half-time, down-tempo dimension to the mix. The genre's popularity grew exponentially in the United Kingdom, as people across the scene's musical spectrum appreciated grime's eclectic mix of instrumentation and subcultures. This hybridisation united many different music scenes, allowing for it to spread in the same word-of-mouth and mixtape-based style as hip-hop, yet still appeal to fans of electronic music. It also paved the way for more electronic music artists to incorporate stronger Jamaican influence in the future. grime never received the same attention worldwide that it did in the UK. Much like many other less mainstream forms of British electronic music, its main scene and fan base remained in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlthough grime is recognised as a creative and innovative musical style,<ref name=\"pay2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3299204|title=will grime pay?|last=Collins|first=Hattie|date=19 November 2004|work=[[Collective (BBC)|Collective]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227170824/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3299204|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> there are other contributing factors to its rapid and widespread growth in popularity.

Reconnection releases energy stored in the original stressed magnetic fields. These magnetic field lines can become twisted in a helical structure, with a 'right-hand twist' or a 'left hand twist'. As the Sun's magnetic field lines become more and more twisted, CMEs appear to be a 'valve' to release the magnetic energy being built up, as evidenced by the helical structure of CMEs, that would otherwise renew itself continuously each solar cycle and eventually rip the Sun apart.<ref name=\"Green2014\">{{cite book |title=15 Million Degrees |publisher=Viking |first=Lucie |last=Green |page=212 |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-670-92218-5}}</ref>\n\nOn the Sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades\u2014a series of closely occurring loops of magnetic lines of force.

One looks at a moderate coronal mass ejection (CME) from 2006. The second run examines the consequences of a large coronal mass ejection, such as the Carrington-class CME of 1859.]]\n\nA typical coronal mass ejection may have any or all of three distinctive features: a cavity of low electron density, a dense core (the [[Solar prominence|prominence]], which appears on coronagraph images as a bright region embedded in this cavity), and a bright leading edge.\n\nMost ejections originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such  as groupings of [[sunspot]]s associated with frequent flares. These regions have closed magnetic field lines, in which the magnetic field strength is large enough to contain the plasma. These field lines must be broken or weakened for the ejection to escape from the Sun. However, CMEs may also be initiated in quiet surface regions, although in many cases the quiet region was recently active. During [[solar minimum]], CMEs form primarily in the coronal streamer belt near the solar magnetic equator. During [[solar maximum]], they originate from active regions whose latitudinal distribution is more homogeneous.\n\nCoronal mass ejections reach velocities from {{convert|20|to|3200|km/s|abbr=on}} with an average speed of {{convert|489|km/s|abbr=on}}, based on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]]/[[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]] measurements between 1996 and 2003. These speeds correspond to transit times from the Sun out to the mean radius of Earth's orbit of about 13 hours to 86 days (extremes), with about 3.5 days as the average. The average mass ejected is {{convert|1.6e12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, the estimated mass values for CMEs are only lower limits, because coronagraph measurements provide only two-dimensional data. The frequency of ejections depends on the phase of the [[solar cycle]]: from about 0.2 per day near the [[solar minimum]] to 3.5 per day near the [[solar maximum]].<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=San Francisco |first1=Bradley W. |last1=Carroll |first2=Dale A. |last2=Ostlie |page=390 |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8053-0402-2}}</ref> These values are also lower limits because ejections propagating away from Earth (backside CMEs) usually cannot be detected by coronagraphs.\n\nCurrent knowledge of coronal mass ejection kinematics indicates that the ejection starts with an initial pre-acceleration phase characterized by a slow rising motion, followed by a period of rapid acceleration away from the Sun until a near-constant velocity is reached. Some ''balloon'' CMEs, usually the slowest ones, lack this three-stage evolution, instead accelerating slowly and continuously throughout their flight. Even for CMEs with a well-defined acceleration stage, the pre-acceleration stage is often absent, or perhaps unobservable.\n\n==Association with other solar phenomena==\n[[File:Close-up on launching filament (SDO-AIA, 304 \u00c5).ogv|thumb|Video of a [[solar prominence|solar filament]] being launched]]\nCoronal mass ejections are often associated with other forms of solar activity, most notably:\n*[[Solar flare]]s\n*Eruptive prominence and X-ray [[sigmoid function|sigmoids]]<ref name=\"Tomczak2012\">{{cite journal |title=A Catalog of Solar X-Ray Plasma Ejections Observed by the Soft X-Ray Telescope on Board ''Yohkoh'' |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |first1=M. |last1=Tomczak |first2=E. |last2=Chmielewska |volume=199 |issue=1 |at=10 |date=March 2012 |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/199/1/10 |bibcode=2012ApJS..199...10T |arxiv=1201.1040}}</ref>\n*Coronal dimming (long-term brightness decrease on the solar surface)\n*[[Moreton wave]]s\n*Coronal waves (bright fronts propagating from the location of the eruption)\n*Post-eruptive arcades\nThe association of a CME with some of those phenomena is common but not fully understood. For example, CMEs and flares are normally closely related, but there was confusion about this point caused by the events originating beyond the limb. For such events no flare could be detected. Most weak flares do not have associated CMEs; most powerful ones do. Some CMEs occur without any flare-like manifestation, but these are the weaker and slower ones.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Search for CMEs Associated with Big Flares |journal=[[Solar Physics (journal)|Solar Physics]] |first=M.

In general, all of these events (including the CME) are thought to be the result of a large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field; the presence or absence of a CME during one of these restructures would reflect the coronal environment of the process (i.e., can the eruption be confined by overlying magnetic structure, or will it simply break through and enter the [[solar wind]]).\n\n==Theoretical models==\nIt was first postulated that CMEs might be driven by the heat of an explosive flare. However, it soon became apparent that many CMEs were not associated with flares, and that even those that were often started before the flare. Because CMEs are initiated in the solar corona (which is dominated by magnetic energy), their energy source must be magnetic.\n\nBecause the energy of CMEs is so high, it is unlikely that their energy could be directly driven by emerging magnetic fields in the photosphere (although this is still a possibility). Therefore, most models of CMEs assume that the energy is stored up in the coronal magnetic field over a long period of time and then suddenly released by some instability or a loss of equilibrium in the field. There is still no consensus on which of these release mechanisms is correct, and observations are not currently able to constrain these models very well. These same considerations apply equally well to [[solar flares]], but the observable signatures of these phenomena differ.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Interplanetary coronal mass ejections==\n[[File:Coronal mass ejection moving toward heliopause.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a coronal mass ejection moving beyond the planets toward the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]]]\nCMEs typically reach Earth one to five days after leaving the Sun.

The same instrument recorded a ''crochet'', an instantaneous perturbation of Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft [[X-ray]]s.

Reconnection releases energy stored in the original stressed magnetic fields. These magnetic field lines can become twisted in a helical structure, with a 'right-hand twist' or a 'left hand twist'. As the Sun's magnetic field lines become more and more twisted, CMEs appear to be a 'valve' to release the magnetic energy being built up, as evidenced by the helical structure of CMEs, that would otherwise renew itself continuously each solar cycle and eventually rip the Sun apart.<ref name=\"Green2014\">{{cite book |title=15 Million Degrees |publisher=Viking |first=Lucie |last=Green |page=212 |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-670-92218-5}}</ref>\n\nOn the Sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades\u2014a series of closely occurring loops of magnetic lines of force.

One looks at a moderate coronal mass ejection (CME) from 2006. The second run examines the consequences of a large coronal mass ejection, such as the Carrington-class CME of 1859.]]\n\nA typical coronal mass ejection may have any or all of three distinctive features: a cavity of low electron density, a dense core (the [[Solar prominence|prominence]], which appears on coronagraph images as a bright region embedded in this cavity), and a bright leading edge.\n\nMost ejections originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such  as groupings of [[sunspot]]s associated with frequent flares. These regions have closed magnetic field lines, in which the magnetic field strength is large enough to contain the plasma. These field lines must be broken or weakened for the ejection to escape from the Sun. However, CMEs may also be initiated in quiet surface regions, although in many cases the quiet region was recently active. During [[solar minimum]], CMEs form primarily in the coronal streamer belt near the solar magnetic equator. During [[solar maximum]], they originate from active regions whose latitudinal distribution is more homogeneous.\n\nCoronal mass ejections reach velocities from {{convert|20|to|3200|km/s|abbr=on}} with an average speed of {{convert|489|km/s|abbr=on}}, based on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]]/[[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]] measurements between 1996 and 2003. These speeds correspond to transit times from the Sun out to the mean radius of Earth's orbit of about 13 hours to 86 days (extremes), with about 3.5 days as the average. The average mass ejected is {{convert|1.6e12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, the estimated mass values for CMEs are only lower limits, because coronagraph measurements provide only two-dimensional data. The frequency of ejections depends on the phase of the [[solar cycle]]: from about 0.2 per day near the [[solar minimum]] to 3.5 per day near the [[solar maximum]].<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=San Francisco |first1=Bradley W. |last1=Carroll |first2=Dale A. |last2=Ostlie |page=390 |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8053-0402-2}}</ref> These values are also lower limits because ejections propagating away from Earth (backside CMEs) usually cannot be detected by coronagraphs.\n\nCurrent knowledge of coronal mass ejection kinematics indicates that the ejection starts with an initial pre-acceleration phase characterized by a slow rising motion, followed by a period of rapid acceleration away from the Sun until a near-constant velocity is reached. Some ''balloon'' CMEs, usually the slowest ones, lack this three-stage evolution, instead accelerating slowly and continuously throughout their flight. Even for CMEs with a well-defined acceleration stage, the pre-acceleration stage is often absent, or perhaps unobservable.\n\n==Association with other solar phenomena==\n[[File:Close-up on launching filament (SDO-AIA, 304 \u00c5).ogv|thumb|Video of a [[solar prominence|solar filament]] being launched]]\nCoronal mass ejections are often associated with other forms of solar activity, most notably:\n*[[Solar flare]]s\n*Eruptive prominence and X-ray [[sigmoid function|sigmoids]]<ref name=\"Tomczak2012\">{{cite journal |title=A Catalog of Solar X-Ray Plasma Ejections Observed by the Soft X-Ray Telescope on Board ''Yohkoh'' |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |first1=M. |last1=Tomczak |first2=E. |last2=Chmielewska |volume=199 |issue=1 |at=10 |date=March 2012 |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/199/1/10 |bibcode=2012ApJS..199...10T |arxiv=1201.1040}}</ref>\n*Coronal dimming (long-term brightness decrease on the solar surface)\n*[[Moreton wave]]s\n*Coronal waves (bright fronts propagating from the location of the eruption)\n*Post-eruptive arcades\nThe association of a CME with some of those phenomena is common but not fully understood. For example, CMEs and flares are normally closely related, but there was confusion about this point caused by the events originating beyond the limb. For such events no flare could be detected. Most weak flares do not have associated CMEs; most powerful ones do. Some CMEs occur without any flare-like manifestation, but these are the weaker and slower ones.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Search for CMEs Associated with Big Flares |journal=[[Solar Physics (journal)|Solar Physics]] |first=M.

In general, all of these events (including the CME) are thought to be the result of a large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field; the presence or absence of a CME during one of these restructures would reflect the coronal environment of the process (i.e., can the eruption be confined by overlying magnetic structure, or will it simply break through and enter the [[solar wind]]).\n\n==Theoretical models==\nIt was first postulated that CMEs might be driven by the heat of an explosive flare. However, it soon became apparent that many CMEs were not associated with flares, and that even those that were often started before the flare. Because CMEs are initiated in the solar corona (which is dominated by magnetic energy), their energy source must be magnetic.\n\nBecause the energy of CMEs is so high, it is unlikely that their energy could be directly driven by emerging magnetic fields in the photosphere (although this is still a possibility). Therefore, most models of CMEs assume that the energy is stored up in the coronal magnetic field over a long period of time and then suddenly released by some instability or a loss of equilibrium in the field. There is still no consensus on which of these release mechanisms is correct, and observations are not currently able to constrain these models very well. These same considerations apply equally well to [[solar flares]], but the observable signatures of these phenomena differ.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Interplanetary coronal mass ejections==\n[[File:Coronal mass ejection moving toward heliopause.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a coronal mass ejection moving beyond the planets toward the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]]]\nCMEs typically reach Earth one to five days after leaving the Sun.
