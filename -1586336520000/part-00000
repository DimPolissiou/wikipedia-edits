Barry obtained a medical degree from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], then served first in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, and subsequently in many parts of the [[British Empire]]. Before retirement, Barry had risen to the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to [[Brigadier-general (United Kingdom)|Brigadier General]]) in charge of [[military hospital]]s, the second highest medical office in the British Army. Barry not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants, and performed the first [[caesarean section]] in Africa by an Irish surgeon in which both the mother and child survived the operation.<ref name=\"New Scientist\" />\n\nAlthough Barry's entire adult life was lived as a man, Barry was born Margaret Ann Bulkley<ref name=\"BBCNews\" /> and was known as female in childhood. Barry lived as a man in both public and private life, at least in part in order to be accepted as a university student and pursue a career as a surgeon, with Barry's birth sex only becoming known to the public and to military colleagues after death.<ref name=\"New Scientist\"/>\n\n==Early life==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\nOther than some personal correspondence, there are few sources of information about the non-military parts of Barry's life. The scant available evidence provides a skeleton onto which a great deal of myth and speculation has been added by various commentators. In his detailed research into Barry's early life,{{sfn|du Preez|2008}} Michael Du Preez states that Barry was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1789, a birth date based on Mrs Bulkley's description of her child being fifteen years old in a letter dated 14 January 1805.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=5}} Various other sources give birth dates of 1792,{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|pp=352\u2013356}}<ref name=leitch /> 1795,<ref name=canada /> and 1799,<ref name=ondb/> but these dates are almost certainly the result of Barry later lying about age on official documents to aid passing as a man.{{sfn|du Preez|2008}}\n\nBarry was the second child born to Jeremiah and Mary-Ann Bulkley, and was given the name Margaret Anne.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=5}} Mary-Ann Bulkley was the sister of [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], a celebrated Irish artist and professor of painting at London's Royal Academy. Jeremiah Bulkley ran the [[weigh house]] in Merchant's Quay, Cork. However, [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic sentiment]] led to his dismissal from this post. This and subsequent financial mismanagement left Mary-Ann and Barry without the support of either Jeremiah Bulkley (whose debts led to him spending time in [[City Marshalsea, Dublin|the Marshalsea]] prison in Dublin) or later the Bulkleys' married son John.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=7}} A third child appeared in the Bulkley family and was named Juliana. Although presented as being Barry's sister, it is likely that she was Barry's daughter as a result of childhood sexual assault, as the charwoman who discovered Barry's sex when laying out the body stated that [[Stretch marks|pregnancy stretch marks]] were present.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=7,8}}\n\nThe teenage Barry was educated with the prospect of becoming a [[governess|tutor]], but given a lack of evidence of any work history, the Bulkleys appear to have struggled to find Barry any suitable tutoring positions.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=43\u201345}} A conspiracy appears to have developed between Barry, Mary-Ann Bulkley and some of the late James Barry's influential, liberal-minded friends (General [[Francisco de Miranda]], Dr [[Edward Fryer]], who had become Barry's personal tutor, and Daniel Reardon, the family's solicitor) to enable the teenage Barry to enter medical school.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=56}} The [[University of Edinburgh]] was chosen and Mary-Ann and Barry boarded a [[Leith]] [[Smack (ship)|smack]] on 30 November 1809.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc=pp. 62\u201363 reproducing a letter dated 14 December 1809 from Mary-Ann to Daniel Readon}} And so, Margaret Anne Bulkley became James Barry, nephew of the late [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry RA]] the Irish romantic painter and remained known thus for the next 56 years.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=58\u201360}} In a letter to Daniel Readon, sent on 14 December, Barry asked for any letters addressed to Margaret Bulkley to be forwarded to Mary-Ann Bulkley (whom Barry now refers to as \"my aunt\"), and mentions that '...it was very usefull {{sic}} for Mrs. Bulkley (my aunt) to have a Gentleman to take care of her on Board Ship and to have one in a strange country...'. Although the letter was signed \"James Barry\", the solicitor indiscreetly wrote on the back of the envelope 'Miss Bulkley, 14 December'; this crucial piece of evidence was the one which enabled researchers to finally confirm that Margaret Bulkley and James Barry were one and the same.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=407}}\n\nArriving in Edinburgh in November 1809, Barry began studies at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Medical School]] as a 'literary and medical student'. Barry's short stature, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led many to suspect that Barry was a young boy not past puberty, and the University Senate initially attempted to block Barry's application for the final examinations due to this apparent youth.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=75\u201377}} However, the [[David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan|Earl of Buchan]], a friend of Dr Fryer and Barry's late namesake, persuaded the Senate to relent and Barry qualified [[Doctor of Medicine|''Medicinae Doctor (MD)'']] in 1812.{{sfn|Barry|1812|p=}}{{efn|Barry's thesis was about [[Femoral hernia]], a condition that is much more common in women than men}} Barry then moved back to London, signing up for the Autumn Course 1812/1813 as a pupil of the United Hospitals of [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']], whose teachers included [[Henry Cline]] and celebrated surgeon [[Astley Cooper]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=82\u201393}} On 2 July 1813, Barry successfully passed the examination of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\n==Career==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\n[[Image:James Barry (surgeon)05.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of James Barry, painted circa 1813\u20131816]]\nUpon joining the army, Barry was commissioned as a Hospital Assistant in the British Army on 6 July 1813, taking up posts in Chelsea and then the [[HMNB Devonport|Royal Military Hospital in Plymouth]], achieving a promotion to Assistant Surgeon to the Forces, equivalent to lieutenant, on 7 December 1815.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=101\u2013105}}<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17096|page=4|date= 2 January 1816}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17106|page=205|date=3 February 1816}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this military training, Barry was posted to [[Cape Town]], South Africa in 1816.{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|p=352}}{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=115\u2013118}} Through Lord Buchan, Barry had a letter of introduction to the Governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lieutenant General Lord Charles Henry Somerset]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=119}} Following the successful, even spectacular, treatment of Lord Charles's sick daughter, Barry was welcomed into the family,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=123}} maintained a close friendship with the Governor, and became his personal physician. In 1822 Somerset appointed Barry as Colonial Medical Inspector,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=167}} an extraordinary jump in expectations from Barry's low military rank which brought with it great responsibility. Over ten years of work in the Cape, Barry effected significant changes, among them improvements to sanitation and water systems, improved conditions for enslaved people, prisoners and the mentally ill, and provision of a sanctuary for the leper population. Barry also performed one of the first known successful [[Caesarean section]]s in which both mother and child survived;{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=215, 216}} the child was christened [[James Barry Munnik]] in Barry's honour, and the name was passed down through the family, leading to Barry's name being borne by a later Prime Minister of South Africa, [[J. B. M. Hertzog]]. Barry also gained enemies by criticising local officials and their handling of medical matters, but the advantage of a close relationship with the Governor meant that the repercussions of these outspoken views were usually smoothed over.\n\nBarry was promoted to Surgeon to the Forces on 22 November 1827.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=18424|page=2582|date=18 December 1827}}</ref>  Barry's subsequent posting was to [[Mauritius]] in 1828. In 1829, Barry risked a great deal of trouble by going absent without leave to return to England and treat Somerset, who had fallen ill, and remained there until Somerset's death in 1831.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=228,231}} Barry's subsequent posting was to [[Jamaica]], and then the island of [[Saint Helena]] in 1836. At St Helena, one clash with a fellow army surgeon resulted in Barry being arrested and [[court-martial]]led on a charge of \"conduct unbecoming of the character of an Officer and a Gentleman\". Barry was found not guilty, and honourably acquitted.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=268\u2013271}}\n\nIn 1840 Barry was posted to the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Windward Islands]] of the West Indies, there focusing on medicine, management and improving the conditions of the troops, and receiving a promotion to [[Royal Army Medical Corps#Military abbreviations applicable to the Medical Corps|Principal Medical Officer]]. In 1845, Barry contracted [[yellow fever]] and left for England for sick leave in October. After being cleared for duty, Barry was posted to [[Malta]] in 1846. Here Barry was severely reprimanded for inexplicably taking a seat in the local church that was reserved for the clergy, and had to deal with the threat \u2013 and eventual actuality \u2013 of [[1846\u20131860 cholera pandemic|a cholera epidemic]], which broke out in 1850.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

Barry was outraged by unnecessary suffering, and took a heavy-handed and sometimes tactless approach to demanding improvements for the poor and underprivileged which often incited anger from officials and military officers; on several occasions Barry was both arrested and demoted for the extremity of this behaviour. Barry held strict and unusually modern views about nutrition, being completely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and [[Teetotalism|teetotal]], and, while keeping most personal relationships distant, was very fond of pets, particularly a beloved poodle named Psyche.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

R. McKinnon, who had issued the death certificate upon which Barry was identified as male. The woman claimed that Barry's body had been biologically  female and had marks suggesting Barry had at one point borne a child.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=378\u2013379}} When McKinnon refused to pay her, she took the story to the press, and the situation became public. It was discussed in an exchange of letters between George Graham of the General Register Office, and Dr McKinnon.{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|pp=354\u2013355}}\n<blockquote>\nSir,\n\nIt has been stated to me that Inspector-General Dr James Barry, who died at 14 Margaret Street on 25 July 1865, was after his death found to be female.\n\nAs you furnished the Certificate as to the cause of his death, I take the liberty of asking you whether what I have heard is true, and whether you yourself ascertained that he was a woman and apparently had been a mother?\n\nPerhaps you may decline answering these questions; but I ask them not for publication but for my own information.\n\nYour faithful servant\n\nGeorge Graham\n</blockquote>\n\nMcKinnon's response was as follows:\n<blockquote>\nSir,\n\nI had been intimately acquainted with the doctor for good many years, both in London and the West Indies and I never had any suspicion that Dr Barry was a woman. I attended him during his last illness, (previously for bronchitis, and the affection for diarrhoea). On one occasion after Dr Barry\u2019s death at the office of Sir Charles McGregor, there was the woman who performed the last offices for Dr Barry was waiting to speak to me. She wished to obtain some prerequisites [sic in source, but has to be a slip for perquisites, \"perks\"] of his employment, which the Lady who kept the lodging house in which Dr Barry died had refused to give her. Amongst other things she said that Dr Barry was a female and that I was a pretty doctor not to know this and she would not like to be attended by me. I informed her that it was none of my business whether Dr Barry was a male or a female, and that I thought that she might be neither, viz. an imperfectly developed man. She then said that she had examined the body, and was a perfect female and farther that there were marks of him having had a child when very young. I then enquired how have you formed that conclusion. The woman, pointing to the lower part of her stomach, said \u2018from marks here. I am a maried{{sic}} woman and the mother of nine children and I ought to know.\u2019\n\nThe woman seems to think that she had become acquainted with a great secret and wished to be paid for keeping it. I informed her that all Dr Barry\u2019s relatives were dead, and that it was no secret of mine, and that my own impression was that Dr Barry was a Hermaphrodite. But whether Dr Barry was a male, female, or hermaphrodite I do not know, nor had I any purpose in making the discovery as I could positively swear to the identity of the body as being that of a person whom I had been acquainted with as Inspector-General of Hospitals for a period of years.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.R. McKinnon\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter the matter was made public, many people claimed to have \"known it all along\". The British Army, seeking to suppress the story, sealed all records of Barry for the next 100 years.<ref name=\"New Scientist\"/> The historian Isobel Rae gained access to the army records in the 1950s, and concluded that James Barry the painter was indeed Barry's uncle.<ref name=sm20081230 /> Barry was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] under the name ''James Barry'' and full military rank. It was claimed by several sources that the manservant who always attended Barry returned to [[Jamaica]], but his actual fate is unknown.\n\n==Gender and personal life==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\nIn a letter chiding John Bulkley, Barry's older brother, for abandoning legal studies for the military, 19-year-old Barry wrote: \"Was I not a girl I would be a Soldier!\".{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=50}}\n\nBarry's interest in medicine was probably encouraged by the liberal-minded friends of the late [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] RA, and just before travelling to Edinburgh to enroll as a medical student in 1809, Barry assumed a male identity.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=51, 59}} A short stature, slight build, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led others to suspect that Barry was not a man but a [[Preadolescence#Prepubescence, puberty and range|pre-pubescent]] boy.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=75, 76}} This identity was maintained through surgical training and recruitment into the [[British Army]] which, at officer rank level, did not then require a medical examination.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=101}}\n\nDuring Barry's first posting abroad to Cape Town in South Africa, Barry became a close friend of the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset, and his family. It has been suggested that Lord Charles discovered Dr Barry's secret and that the relationship was more than friendship.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=154}} Their closeness led to rumours and ultimately an accusation briefly appearing on a bridge post in Cape Town on 1 June 1824 saying that the writer had \"detected Lord Charles buggering Dr Barry\",{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=182}} which led to a court trial and investigation, as [[homosexuality]] was at that time strictly illegal. Despite these allegations, if Somerset was aware of Barry's sex, he did not reveal it.\n\nDespite efforts to appear masculine, witness reports comment on Barry's effeminacy{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=125}} and on a somewhat contradictory reputation \u2013 Barry had a reputation for being tactless, impatient, argumentative and opinionated,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

Barry's aim was better, the bullet striking Cloete's [[shako]] military cap and removing its peak, which dissipated its force.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=155\u2013159}}\n\nDuring the [[Crimean War]] (1854\u20131856), Barry got into an argument with [[Florence Nightingale]].<ref name=ondb /> After Barry's death Nightingale wrote that: <blockquote>I never had such a blackguard rating in all my life \u2013 I who have had more than any woman \u2013 than from this Barry sitting on his horse, while I was crossing the Hospital Square with only my cap on in the sun. \"He\" kept me standing in the midst of quite a crowd of soldiers, Commissariat, servants, camp followers, etc., etc., every one of whom behaved like a gentleman during the scolding I received while \"he\" behaved like a brute . . . After \"he\" was dead, I was told that (Barry) was a woman . . . I should  say that (Barry) was the most hardened creature I ever met.<ref name=\"FloNight\" /></blockquote>\nBarry would never allow anyone into the room while undressing, and repeated a standing instruction that \"in the event of his death, strict precautions should be adopted to prevent any examination of his person\"{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

''We Are Family,'' an LGBT magazine, argues that this is strong evidence of Barry's having been a transgender man, given that \"his wish was to die and be remembered as a man.\"<ref name=\"WeAreFam\" />\n\n== Intersex controversy ==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\n{{harvnb|Kubba|Young|2001|p=355}} picked up on Major McKinnon's statement that he did not know whether Barry was \"male, female or hermaphrodite\" and suggested that it might be more appropriate to say that Barry was \"[[hermaphrodite]]\" [or [[intersex]]] rather than \"female\", and \"may have had ambiguous genitalia\". These suppositions are based on the premise that \"Concealment of one's sex for ...  40 years in the British Army, is simply unbelievable\". However, {{harvnb|du Preez|Dronfield|2016}} show how Barry might have been able to conceal this secret from all but a few people, and those who did know did not reveal it while Barry was alive. N. Turner has commented on Kubba and Young's conclusion that the belief in an intersex condition was based on \"vanishingly slim evidence\".<ref name=\"turner\" />\n\n{{harvnb|Holmes|2003|p=}} also raises the possibility of Barry being intersex, but acknowledges the impossibility of knowing, expressing surprise that this is a problem for so many people. The suggestion that Barry may have been intersex has been criticised for both biological and social reasons.

1865) was a military surgeon in the [[British Army]], born in Cork, Ireland. Barry obtained a medical degree from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], then served first in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, and subsequently in many parts of the [[British Empire]]. Before retirement, Barry had risen to the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to [[Brigadier-general (United Kingdom)|Brigadier General]]) in charge of [[military hospital]]s, the second highest medical office in the British Army. Barry not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants, and performed the first [[caesarean section]] in Africa by an Irish surgeon in which both the mother and child survived the operation.<ref name=\"New Scientist\" />\n\nAlthough Barry's entire adult life was lived as a man, Barry was born Margaret Ann Bulkley<ref name=\"BBCNews\" /> and was known as female in childhood. Barry lived as a man in both public and private life, at least in part in order to be accepted as a university student and pursue a career as a surgeon, with Barry's birth sex only becoming known to the public and to military colleagues after death.<ref name=\"New Scientist\"/>\n\n==Early life==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\nOther than some personal correspondence, there are few sources of information about the non-military parts of Barry's life. The scant available evidence provides a skeleton onto which a great deal of myth and speculation has been added by various commentators. In his detailed research into Barry's early life,{{sfn|du Preez|2008}} Michael Du Preez states that Barry was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1789, a birth date based on Mrs Bulkley's description of her child being fifteen years old in a letter dated 14 January 1805.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=5}} Various other sources give birth dates of 1792,{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|pp=352\u2013356}}<ref name=leitch /> 1795,<ref name=canada /> and 1799,<ref name=ondb/> but these dates are almost certainly the result of Barry later lying about age on official documents to aid passing as a man.{{sfn|du Preez|2008}}\n\nBarry was the second child born to Jeremiah and Mary-Ann Bulkley, and was given the name Margaret Anne.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=5}} Mary-Ann Bulkley was the sister of [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], a celebrated Irish artist and professor of painting at London's Royal Academy. Jeremiah Bulkley ran the [[weigh house]] in Merchant's Quay, Cork. However, [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic sentiment]] led to his dismissal from this post. This and subsequent financial mismanagement left Mary-Ann and Barry without the support of either Jeremiah Bulkley (whose debts led to him spending time in [[City Marshalsea, Dublin|the Marshalsea]] prison in Dublin) or later the Bulkleys' married son John.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=7}} A third child appeared in the Bulkley family and was named Juliana. Although presented as being Barry's sister, it is likely that she was Barry's daughter as a result of childhood sexual assault, as the charwoman who discovered Barry's sex when laying out the body stated that [[Stretch marks|pregnancy stretch marks]] were present.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=7,8}}\n\nThe teenage Barry was educated with the prospect of becoming a [[governess|tutor]], but given a lack of evidence of any work history, the Bulkleys appear to have struggled to find Barry any suitable tutoring positions.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=43\u201345}} A conspiracy appears to have developed between Barry, Mary-Ann Bulkley and some of the late James Barry's influential, liberal-minded friends (General [[Francisco de Miranda]], Dr [[Edward Fryer]], who had become Barry's personal tutor, and Daniel Reardon, the family's solicitor) to enable the teenage Barry to enter medical school.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=56}} The [[University of Edinburgh]] was chosen and Mary-Ann and Barry boarded a [[Leith]] [[Smack (ship)|smack]] on 30 November 1809.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc=pp. 62\u201363 reproducing a letter dated 14 December 1809 from Mary-Ann to Daniel Readon}} And so, Margaret Anne Bulkley became James Barry, nephew of the late [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry RA]] the Irish romantic painter and remained known thus for the next 56 years.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=58\u201360}} In a letter to Daniel Readon, sent on 14 December, Barry asked for any letters addressed to Margaret Bulkley to be forwarded to Mary-Ann Bulkley (whom Barry now refers to as \"my aunt\"), and mentions that '...it was very usefull {{sic}} for Mrs. Bulkley (my aunt) to have a Gentleman to take care of her on Board Ship and to have one in a strange country...'. Although the letter was signed \"James Barry\", the solicitor indiscreetly wrote on the back of the envelope 'Miss Bulkley, 14 December'; this crucial piece of evidence was the one which enabled researchers to finally confirm that Margaret Bulkley and James Barry were one and the same.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=407}}\n\nArriving in Edinburgh in November 1809, Barry began studies at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Medical School]] as a 'literary and medical student'. Barry's short stature, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led many to suspect that Barry was a young boy not past puberty, and the University Senate initially attempted to block Barry's application for the final examinations due to this apparent youth.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=75\u201377}} However, the [[David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan|Earl of Buchan]], a friend of Dr Fryer and Barry's late namesake, persuaded the Senate to relent and Barry qualified [[Doctor of Medicine|''Medicinae Doctor (MD)'']] in 1812.{{sfn|Barry|1812|p=}}{{efn|Barry's thesis was about [[Femoral hernia]], a condition that is much more common in women than men}} Barry then moved back to London, signing up for the Autumn Course 1812/1813 as a pupil of the United Hospitals of [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']], whose teachers included [[Henry Cline]] and celebrated surgeon [[Astley Cooper]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=82\u201393}} On 2 July 1813, Barry successfully passed the examination of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\n==Career==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\n[[Image:James Barry (surgeon)05.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of James Barry, painted circa 1813\u20131816]]\nUpon joining the army, Barry was commissioned as a Hospital Assistant in the British Army on 6 July 1813, taking up posts in Chelsea and then the [[HMNB Devonport|Royal Military Hospital in Plymouth]], achieving a promotion to Assistant Surgeon to the Forces, equivalent to lieutenant, on 7 December 1815.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=101\u2013105}}<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17096|page=4|date= 2 January 1816}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17106|page=205|date=3 February 1816}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this military training, Barry was posted to [[Cape Town]], South Africa in 1816.{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|p=352}}{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=115\u2013118}} Through Lord Buchan, Barry had a letter of introduction to the Governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lieutenant General Lord Charles Henry Somerset]].{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=119}} Following the successful, even spectacular, treatment of Lord Charles's sick daughter, Barry was welcomed into the family,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=123}} maintained a close friendship with the Governor, and became his personal physician. In 1822 Somerset appointed Barry as Colonial Medical Inspector,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=167}} an extraordinary jump in expectations from Barry's low military rank which brought with it great responsibility. Over ten years of work in the Cape, Barry effected significant changes, among them improvements to sanitation and water systems, improved conditions for enslaved people, prisoners and the mentally ill, and provision of a sanctuary for the leper population. Barry also performed one of the first known successful [[Caesarean section]]s in which both mother and child survived;{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=215, 216}} the child was christened [[James Barry Munnik]] in Barry's honour, and the name was passed down through the family, leading to Barry's name being borne by a later Prime Minister of South Africa, [[J. B. M. Hertzog]]. Barry also gained enemies by criticising local officials and their handling of medical matters, but the advantage of a close relationship with the Governor meant that the repercussions of these outspoken views were usually smoothed over.\n\nBarry was promoted to Surgeon to the Forces on 22 November 1827.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=18424|page=2582|date=18 December 1827}}</ref>  Barry's subsequent posting was to [[Mauritius]] in 1828. In 1829, Barry risked a great deal of trouble by going absent without leave to return to England and treat Somerset, who had fallen ill, and remained there until Somerset's death in 1831.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=228,231}} Barry's subsequent posting was to [[Jamaica]], and then the island of [[Saint Helena]] in 1836. At St Helena, one clash with a fellow army surgeon resulted in Barry being arrested and [[court-martial]]led on a charge of \"conduct unbecoming of the character of an Officer and a Gentleman\". Barry was found not guilty, and honourably acquitted.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=268\u2013271}}\n\nIn 1840 Barry was posted to the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Windward Islands]] of the West Indies, there focusing on medicine, management and improving the conditions of the troops, and receiving a promotion to [[Royal Army Medical Corps#Military abbreviations applicable to the Medical Corps|Principal Medical Officer]]. In 1845, Barry contracted [[yellow fever]] and left for England for sick leave in October. After being cleared for duty, Barry was posted to [[Malta]] in 1846. Here Barry was severely reprimanded for inexplicably taking a seat in the local church that was reserved for the clergy, and had to deal with the threat \u2013 and eventual actuality \u2013 of [[1846\u20131860 cholera pandemic|a cholera epidemic]], which broke out in 1850.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

Barry was outraged by unnecessary suffering, and took a heavy-handed and sometimes tactless approach to demanding improvements for the poor and underprivileged which often incited anger from officials and military officers; on several occasions Barry was both arrested and demoted for the extremity of this behaviour. Barry held strict and unusually modern views about nutrition, being completely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and [[Teetotalism|teetotal]], and, while keeping most personal relationships distant, was very fond of pets, particularly a beloved poodle named Psyche.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

R. McKinnon, who had issued the death certificate upon which Barry was identified as male. The woman claimed that Barry's body had been biologically  female and had marks suggesting Barry had at one point borne a child.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=378\u2013379}} When McKinnon refused to pay her, she took the story to the press, and the situation became public. It was discussed in an exchange of letters between George Graham of the General Register Office, and Dr McKinnon.{{sfn|Kubba|Young|2001|pp=354\u2013355}}\n<blockquote>\nSir,\n\nIt has been stated to me that Inspector-General Dr James Barry, who died at 14 Margaret Street on 25 July 1865, was after his death found to be female.\n\nAs you furnished the Certificate as to the cause of his death, I take the liberty of asking you whether what I have heard is true, and whether you yourself ascertained that he was a woman and apparently had been a mother?\n\nPerhaps you may decline answering these questions; but I ask them not for publication but for my own information.\n\nYour faithful servant\n\nGeorge Graham\n</blockquote>\n\nMcKinnon's response was as follows:\n<blockquote>\nSir,\n\nI had been intimately acquainted with the doctor for good many years, both in London and the West Indies and I never had any suspicion that Dr Barry was a woman. I attended him during his last illness, (previously for bronchitis, and the affection for diarrhoea). On one occasion after Dr Barry\u2019s death at the office of Sir Charles McGregor, there was the woman who performed the last offices for Dr Barry was waiting to speak to me. She wished to obtain some prerequisites [sic in source, but has to be a slip for perquisites, \"perks\"] of his employment, which the Lady who kept the lodging house in which Dr Barry died had refused to give her. Amongst other things she said that Dr Barry was a female and that I was a pretty doctor not to know this and she would not like to be attended by me. I informed her that it was none of my business whether Dr Barry was a male or a female, and that I thought that she might be neither, viz. an imperfectly developed man. She then said that she had examined the body, and was a perfect female and farther that there were marks of him having had a child when very young. I then enquired how have you formed that conclusion. The woman, pointing to the lower part of her stomach, said \u2018from marks here. I am a maried{{sic}} woman and the mother of nine children and I ought to know.\u2019\n\nThe woman seems to think that she had become acquainted with a great secret and wished to be paid for keeping it. I informed her that all Dr Barry\u2019s relatives were dead, and that it was no secret of mine, and that my own impression was that Dr Barry was a Hermaphrodite. But whether Dr Barry was a male, female, or hermaphrodite I do not know, nor had I any purpose in making the discovery as I could positively swear to the identity of the body as being that of a person whom I had been acquainted with as Inspector-General of Hospitals for a period of years.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.R. McKinnon\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter the matter was made public, many people claimed to have \"known it all along\". The British Army, seeking to suppress the story, sealed all records of Barry for the next 100 years.<ref name=\"New Scientist\"/> The historian Isobel Rae gained access to the army records in the 1950s, and concluded that James Barry the painter was indeed Barry's uncle.<ref name=sm20081230 /> Barry was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] under the name ''James Barry'' and full military rank. It was claimed by several sources that the manservant who always attended Barry returned to [[Jamaica]], but his actual fate is unknown.\n\n==Gender and personal life==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\nIn a letter chiding John Bulkley, Barry's older brother, for abandoning legal studies for the military, 19-year-old Barry wrote: \"Was I not a girl I would be a Soldier!\".{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=50}}\n\nBarry's interest in medicine was probably encouraged by the liberal-minded friends of the late [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] RA, and just before travelling to Edinburgh to enroll as a medical student in 1809, Barry assumed a male identity.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=51, 59}} A short stature, slight build, unbroken voice, delicate features and smooth skin led others to suspect that Barry was not a man but a [[Preadolescence#Prepubescence, puberty and range|pre-pubescent]] boy.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|pp=75, 76}} This identity was maintained through surgical training and recruitment into the [[British Army]] which, at officer rank level, did not then require a medical examination.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=101}}\n\nDuring Barry's first posting abroad to Cape Town in South Africa, Barry became a close friend of the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset, and his family. It has been suggested that Lord Charles discovered Dr Barry's secret and that the relationship was more than friendship.{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=154}} Their closeness led to rumours and ultimately an accusation briefly appearing on a bridge post in Cape Town on 1 June 1824 saying that the writer had \"detected Lord Charles buggering Dr Barry\",{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=182}} which led to a court trial and investigation, as [[homosexuality]] was at that time strictly illegal. Despite these allegations, if Somerset was aware of Barry's sex, he did not reveal it.\n\nDespite efforts to appear masculine, witness reports comment on Barry's effeminacy{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|p=125}} and on a somewhat contradictory reputation \u2013 Barry had a reputation for being tactless, impatient, argumentative and opinionated,{{sfn|du Preez|Dronfield|2016|loc= pp. 251, 252 citing Bradford, Edward, 'The Reputed Female Army Surgeon', The Medical Times and Gazette vol.

''We Are Family,'' an LGBT magazine, argues that this is strong evidence of Barry's having been a transgender man, given that \"his wish was to die and be remembered as a man.\"<ref name=\"WeAreFam\" />\n\n== Intersex controversy ==\n<!--NOTE: This article refers to Barry as \"Barry\" wherever possible, avoiding specifically male or female third person pronouns.-->\n{{harvnb|Kubba|Young|2001|p=355}} picked up on Major McKinnon's statement that he did not know whether Barry was \"male, female or hermaphrodite\" and suggested that it might be more appropriate to say that Barry was \"[[hermaphrodite]]\" [or [[intersex]]] rather than \"female\", and \"may have had ambiguous genitalia\". These suppositions are based on the premise that \"Concealment of one's sex for ...  40 years in the British Army, is simply unbelievable\". However, {{harvnb|du Preez|Dronfield|2016}} show how Barry might have been able to conceal this secret from all but a few people, and those who did know did not reveal it while Barry was alive. N.

[[Willem 's Gravesande]] of the Netherlands provided experimental evidence of this relationship. By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, [[Willem 's Gravesande]] determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed.

These can be categorized in two main classes: [[potential energy]] and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029010728/https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|archive-date=2017-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nKinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a [[cyclist]] uses [[food energy|chemical energy provided by food]] to accelerate a [[bicycle]] to a chosen speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome [[drag (physics)|air resistance]] and [[friction]]. The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces heat within the cyclist.\n\nThe kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms.  For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top.  The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill.  Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a [[Bottle dynamo|dynamo]] to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent.  The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy.  Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as [[heat]].\n\nLike any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer's [[frame of reference]]. Thus, the kinetic energy of an object is not [[Galilean invariance|invariant]].\n\n[[Spacecraft]] use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]].  In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space. However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] or [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]], then throughout the orbit kinetic and [[potential energy]] are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Without loss or gain, however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.\n\nKinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of [[billiards]], the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates its speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. [[Collisions]] in billiards are effectively [[elastic collision]]s, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In [[inelastic collision]]s, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures).\n\n[[Flywheel]]s have been developed as a method of [[flywheel energy storage|energy storage]].  This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.\n\nSeveral mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula \u00bdmv\u00b2 given by [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian (classical) mechanics]] is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or [[sub-atomic scale]], [[quantum mechanical]] effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.\n\n==Newtonian kinetic energy==\n\n===Kinetic energy of rigid bodies===\nIn [[classical mechanics]], the kinetic energy of a ''point object'' (an object so small that its mass can be assumed to exist at one point), or a non-rotating [[rigid body]] depends on the [[mass]] of the body as well as its [[speed]]. The kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 the [[Multiplication|product]] of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form::\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the mass and <math>v</math> is the speed (or the velocity) of the body. In [[SI]] units, mass is measured in [[kilogram]]s, speed in [[metres per second]], and the resulting kinetic energy is in [[joule]]s.\n\nFor example, one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80&nbsp;kg mass (about 180&nbsp;lbs) traveling at 18&nbsp;metres per second (about 40&nbsp;mph, or 65&nbsp;km/h) as\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 80 \\,\\text{kg} \\cdot \\left(18 \\,\\text{m/s}\\right)^2 = 12,960 \\,\\text{J} = 12.96 \\,\\text{kJ}</math>\n\nWhen a person throws a ball, the person does [[work (physics)|work]] on it to give it speed as it leaves the hand. The moving ball can then hit something and push it, doing work on what it hits. The kinetic energy of a moving object is equal to the work required to bring it from rest to that speed, or the work the object can do while being brought to rest: '''net force \u00d7 displacement = kinetic energy''', i.e.,\n\n:<math>Fs = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2</math>\n\nSince the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is related to its [[momentum]] by the equation:\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{p^2}{2m}</math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>p\\;</math> is momentum\n:<math>m\\;</math> is mass of the body\n\nFor the ''translational kinetic energy,'' that is the kinetic energy associated with [[rectilinear motion]], of a [[rigid body]] with constant [[mass]] <math>m\\;</math>, whose [[center of mass]] is moving in a straight line with speed <math>v\\;</math>, as seen above is equal to\n\n:<math> E_\\text{t} = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 </math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>m\\;</math> is the mass of the body\n:<math>v\\;</math> is the speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body.\n\nThe kinetic energy of any entity depends on the reference frame in which it is measured. However the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the [[Oberth effect]]. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.\n\nThe kinetic energy of such systems depends on the choice of reference frame: the reference frame that gives the minimum value of that energy is the [[center of momentum]] frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the [[invariant mass]] of the system as a whole.\n\n====Derivation====\nThe work done in accelerating a particle with mass ''m'' during the infinitesimal time interval ''dt'' is given by the dot product of ''force'' '''F''' and the infinitesimal ''displacement ''d'''x'''''\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} d t = \\frac{d \\mathbf{p}}{d t} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} d t = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\mathbf{v})\\,,</math>\nwhere we have assumed the relationship '''p'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;'''v''' and the validity of [[Newton's Second Law]]. (However, also see the special relativistic derivation [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|below]].)\n\nApplying the [[product rule]] we see that:\n:<math>d(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = (d \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot (d \\mathbf{v}) =  2(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{v}).</math>\n\nTherefore, (assuming constant mass so that ''dm'' = 0), we have,\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{m}{2} d (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{m}{2} d v^2  = d \\left(\\frac{m v^2}{2}\\right).</math>\n\nSince this is a [[total differential]] (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy. Assuming the object was at rest at time 0, we integrate from time 0 to time t because the work done by the force to bring the object from rest to velocity ''v'' is equal to the work necessary to do the reverse:\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x} = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\mathbf{v}) = \\int_0^v d \\left(\\frac{m v^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{m v^2}{2}.</math>\n\nThis equation states that the kinetic energy (''E''<sub>k</sub>) is equal to the [[integral]] of the [[dot product]] of the [[velocity]] ('''v''') of a body and the [[infinitesimal]] change of the body's [[momentum]] ('''p'''). It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).\n\n===Rotating bodies===\nIf a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has [[rotational energy|''rotational kinetic energy'']] (<math>E_\\text{r}\\,</math>) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:\n\n:<math>E_\\text{r} = \\int_Q \\frac{v^2 dm}{2} = \\int_Q \\frac{(r \\omega)^2 dm}{2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{2} \\int_Q {r^2}dm = \\frac{\\omega^2}{2} I = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2</math>\n\nwhere:\n* \u03c9 is the body's [[angular velocity]]\n* ''r'' is the distance of any mass ''dm'' from that line\n* <math>I\\,</math> is the body's [[moment of inertia]], equal to <math>\\int_Q {r^2}dm</math>.\n\n(In this equation the moment of [[inertia]] must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by \u03c9 must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).\n\n===Kinetic energy of systems===\nA system of bodies may have internal kinetic energy due to the relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the [[Solar System]] the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the bodies it contains.\n\nA macroscopic body that is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's [[center of momentum]]) may have various kinds of [[internal energy]] at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However all internal energies of all types contribute to body's mass, inertia, and total energy.\n\n===Fluid dynamics===\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], the kinetic energy per unit volume at each point in an incompressible fluid flow field is called the [[dynamic pressure]] at that point.<ref>A.M. Kuethe and J.D. Schetzer (1959) ''Foundations of Aerodynamics'', 2nd edition, p.53.

For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary to an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Introduction to the theory of relativity\n|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000sear_c2m9\n|url-access=registration\n|first1=Francis Weston\n|last1=Sears\n|first2=Robert W.\n|last2=Brehme\n|publisher=Addison-Wesley\n|year=1968\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000sear_c2m9/page/127 127]\n}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cpzvAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22in+its+own+rest+frame%22+%22kinetic+energy%22&q=%22in+its+own+rest+frame%22 Snippet view of page 127]\n</ref> By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case, the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's [[invariant mass]], which is independent of the reference frame.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of a system depends on the [[inertial frame of reference]]: it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a [[center of momentum frame]] and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the [[center of mass]].\n\nThis may be simply shown: let <math>\\textstyle\\mathbf{V}</math> be the relative velocity of the center of mass frame ''i'' in the frame ''k''. Since\n: <math>\n  v^2 = \\left(v_i + V\\right)^2\n      = \\left(\\mathbf{v}_i + \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{v}_i + \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n      = \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_i + 2 \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{V} + \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{V}\n      = v_i^2 + 2 \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{V} + V^2,\n</math>\n\nThen,\n:<math>\n  E_\\text{k} = \\int \\frac{v^2}{2} dm = \\int \\frac{v_i^2}{2} dm + \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\int \\mathbf{v}_i dm + \\frac{V^2}{2} \\int dm.\n</math>\n\nHowever, let <math> \\int \\frac{v_i^2}{2} dm = E_i </math> the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame, <math> \\int \\mathbf{v}_i dm </math> would be simply the total momentum that is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: <math> \\int dm = M </math>. Substituting, we get:<ref>[http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/intro_physics_1/intro_physics_1/node64.html Physics notes - Kinetic energy in the CM frame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611231147/http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/intro_physics_1/intro_physics_1/node64.html |date=2007-06-11 }}.

In any different frame of reference, there is additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass. The kinetic energy of the system in the [[center of momentum frame]] is a quantity that is invariant (all observers see it to be the same).\n\n===Rotation in systems===\nIt sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body's center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass ([[rotational energy]]):\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = E_\\text{t} + E_\\text{r} \\,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''E''<sub>k</sub> is the total kinetic energy\n:''E''<sub>t</sub> is the translational kinetic energy\n:''E''<sub>r</sub> is the ''rotational energy'' or ''angular kinetic energy'' in the rest frame\n\nThus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.\n\n==Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies==\n{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}\n\nIf a body's speed is a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]], it is necessary to use relativistic mechanics to calculate its kinetic energy. In [[special relativity]] theory, the expression for linear momentum is modified.\n\nWith ''m'' being an object's [[rest mass]], '''v''' and ''v'' its velocity and speed, and ''c'' the speed of light in vacuum, we use the expression for linear momentum <math>\\mathbf{p} = m\\gamma \\mathbf{v}</math>, where <math>\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}</math>.\n\n[[Integration by parts|Integrating by parts]] yields\n:<math>E_\\text{k} =\n  \\int \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d \\mathbf{p} =\n  \\int \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\gamma \\mathbf{v}) =\n  m \\gamma \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} - \\int m \\gamma \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d \\mathbf{v} =\n  m \\gamma v^2 - \\frac{m}{2} \\int \\gamma d \\left(v^2\\right)\n</math>\n\nSince <math>\\gamma = \\left(1 - v^2/c^2\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math>,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  E_\\text{k} &= m \\gamma v^2 - \\frac{- m c^2}{2} \\int \\gamma d \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\\\\n             &= m \\gamma v^2 + m c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2} - E_0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>E_0</math> is a [[constant of integration]] for the [[indefinite integral]].\n\nSimplifying the expression we obtain\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  E_\\text{k} &= m \\gamma \\left(v^2 + c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)\\right) - E_0 \\\\\n             &= m \\gamma \\left(v^2 + c^2 - v^2\\right) - E_0 \\\\\n             &= m \\gamma c^2 - E_0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>E_0</math> is found by observing that when <math>\\mathbf{v} = 0,\\ \\gamma = 1</math> and <math> E_\\text{k} = 0</math>, giving\n:<math>E_0 = m c^2 \\,</math>\n\nresulting in the formula\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = m \\gamma c^2 - m c^2 = \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - m c^2</math>\n\nThis formula shows that the work expended accelerating an object from rest approaches infinity as the velocity approaches the speed of light. Thus it is impossible to accelerate an object across this boundary.\n\nThe mathematical by-product of this calculation is the [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula\u2014the body at rest must have energy content\n\n:<math>E_\\text{rest} = E_0 = m c^2 \\!</math>\n\nAt a low speed (''v'' \u226a ''c''), the relativistic kinetic energy is approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. This is done by [[binomial approximation]] or by taking the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] for the reciprocal square root:\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} \\approx m c^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) - m c^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2</math>\n\nSo, the total energy <math>E_k</math> can be partitioned into the rest mass energy plus the Newtonian kinetic energy at low speeds.\n\nWhen objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate.

For example, for a speed of {{convert|10|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} the correction to the Newtonian kinetic energy is 0.0417&nbsp;J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 50&nbsp;MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100&nbsp;km/s it is 417&nbsp;J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 5&nbsp;GJ/kg).\n\nThe relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is given by\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} - m c^2</math>\n\nThis can also be expanded as a [[Taylor series]], the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics:<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/qmech/Quantum/node107.html\n |title=Fine Structure of Hydrogen\n |first=Richard\n |last=Fitzpatrick\n |date=20 July 2010\n |work=Quantum Mechanics\n |accessdate=20 August 2016\n}}</ref>\n:<math>E_\\text{k} \\approx \\frac{p^2}{2 m} - \\frac{p^4}{8 m^3 c^2}.</math>\n\nThis suggests that the formulae for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but concepts emerging from the equivalence of mass and energy and the principles of relativity.\n\n===General relativity===\n{{see also|Schwarzschild geodesics}}\nUsing the convention that\n:<math>g_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, u^{\\alpha} \\, u^{\\beta} \\, = \\, - c^2</math>\n\nwhere the [[four-velocity]] of a particle is\n:<math>u^{\\alpha} \\, = \\, \\frac{d x^{\\alpha}}{d \\tau}</math>\n\nand <math>\\tau \\,</math> is the [[proper time]] of the particle, there is also an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle in [[general relativity]].\n\nIf the particle has momentum\n:<math>p_{\\beta} \\, = \\, m \\, g_{\\beta\\alpha} \\, u^{\\alpha}</math>\n\nas it passes by an observer with four-velocity ''u''<sub>obs</sub>, then the expression for total energy of the particle as observed (measured in a local inertial frame) is\n:<math>E \\, = \\, - \\, p_{\\beta} \\, u_{\\text{obs}}^{\\beta}</math>\n\nand the kinetic energy can be expressed as the total energy minus the rest energy:\n:<math>E_{k} \\, = \\, - \\, p_{\\beta} \\, u_{\\text{obs}}^{\\beta} \\, - \\, m \\, c^2 \\,.</math>\n\nConsider the case of a metric that is diagonal and spatially isotropic (''g''<sub>''tt''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ss''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ss''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ss''</sub>).

For one particle of mass ''m'', the kinetic energy operator appears as a term in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and is defined in terms of the more fundamental momentum operator <math>\\hat p</math>.

By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, [[Willem 's Gravesande]] determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed.

These can be categorized in two main classes: [[potential energy]] and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029010728/https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|archive-date=2017-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nKinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a [[cyclist]] uses [[food energy|chemical energy provided by food]] to accelerate a [[bicycle]] to a chosen speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome [[drag (physics)|air resistance]] and [[friction]]. The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces heat within the cyclist.\n\nThe kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms.  For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top.  The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill.  Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a [[Bottle dynamo|dynamo]] to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent.  The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy.  Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as [[heat]].\n\nLike any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer's [[frame of reference]]. Thus, the kinetic energy of an object is not [[Galilean invariance|invariant]].\n\n[[Spacecraft]] use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]].  In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space. However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] or [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]], then throughout the orbit kinetic and [[potential energy]] are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Without loss or gain, however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.\n\nKinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of [[billiards]], the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates its speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. [[Collisions]] in billiards are effectively [[elastic collision]]s, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In [[inelastic collision]]s, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures).\n\n[[Flywheel]]s have been developed as a method of [[flywheel energy storage|energy storage]].  This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.\n\nSeveral mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula \u00bdmv\u00b2 given by [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian (classical) mechanics]] is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or [[sub-atomic scale]], [[quantum mechanical]] effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.\n\n==Newtonian kinetic energy==\n\n===Kinetic energy of rigid bodies===\nIn [[classical mechanics]], the kinetic energy of a ''point object'' (an object so small that its mass can be assumed to exist at one point), or a non-rotating [[rigid body]] depends on the [[mass]] of the body as well as its [[speed]]. The kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 the [[Multiplication|product]] of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form:\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the mass and <math>v</math> is the speed (or the velocity) of the body. In [[SI]] units, mass is measured in [[kilogram]]s, speed in [[metres per second]], and the resulting kinetic energy is in [[joule]]s.\n\nFor example, one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80&nbsp;kg mass (about 180&nbsp;lbs) traveling at 18&nbsp;metres per second (about 40&nbsp;mph, or 65&nbsp;km/h) as\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 80 \\,\\text{kg} \\cdot \\left(18 \\,\\text{m/s}\\right)^2 = 12,960 \\,\\text{J} = 12.96 \\,\\text{kJ}</math>\n\nWhen a person throws a ball, the person does [[work (physics)|work]] on it to give it speed as it leaves the hand. The moving ball can then hit something and push it, doing work on what it hits. The kinetic energy of a moving object is equal to the work required to bring it from rest to that speed, or the work the object can do while being brought to rest: '''net force \u00d7 displacement = kinetic energy''', i.e.,\n\n:<math>Fs = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2</math>\n\nSince the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is related to its [[momentum]] by the equation:\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{p^2}{2m}</math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>p\\;</math> is momentum\n:<math>m\\;</math> is mass of the body\n\nFor the ''translational kinetic energy,'' that is the kinetic energy associated with [[rectilinear motion]], of a [[rigid body]] with constant [[mass]] <math>m\\;</math>, whose [[center of mass]] is moving in a straight line with speed <math>v\\;</math>, as seen above is equal to\n\n:<math> E_\\text{t} = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 </math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>m\\;</math> is the mass of the body\n:<math>v\\;</math> is the speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body.\n\nThe kinetic energy of any entity depends on the reference frame in which it is measured. However the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the [[Oberth effect]]. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.\n\nThe kinetic energy of such systems depends on the choice of reference frame: the reference frame that gives the minimum value of that energy is the [[center of momentum]] frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the [[invariant mass]] of the system as a whole.\n\n====Derivation====\nThe work done in accelerating a particle with mass ''m'' during the infinitesimal time interval ''dt'' is given by the dot product of ''force'' '''F''' and the infinitesimal ''displacement ''d'''x'''''\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} d t = \\frac{d \\mathbf{p}}{d t} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} d t = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\mathbf{v})\\,,</math>\nwhere we have assumed the relationship '''p'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;'''v''' and the validity of [[Newton's Second Law]]. (However, also see the special relativistic derivation [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|below]].)\n\nApplying the [[product rule]] we see that:\n:<math>d(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = (d \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot (d \\mathbf{v}) =  2(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{v}).</math>\n\nTherefore, (assuming constant mass so that ''dm'' = 0), we have,\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{m}{2} d (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{m}{2} d v^2  = d \\left(\\frac{m v^2}{2}\\right).</math>\n\nSince this is a [[total differential]] (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy. Assuming the object was at rest at time 0, we integrate from time 0 to time t because the work done by the force to bring the object from rest to velocity ''v'' is equal to the work necessary to do the reverse:\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x} = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\mathbf{v}) = \\int_0^v d \\left(\\frac{m v^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{m v^2}{2}.</math>\n\nThis equation states that the kinetic energy (''E''<sub>k</sub>) is equal to the [[integral]] of the [[dot product]] of the [[velocity]] ('''v''') of a body and the [[infinitesimal]] change of the body's [[momentum]] ('''p'''). It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).\n\n===Rotating bodies===\nIf a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has [[rotational energy|''rotational kinetic energy'']] (<math>E_\\text{r}\\,</math>) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:\n\n:<math>E_\\text{r} = \\int_Q \\frac{v^2 dm}{2} = \\int_Q \\frac{(r \\omega)^2 dm}{2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{2} \\int_Q {r^2}dm = \\frac{\\omega^2}{2} I = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2</math>\n\nwhere:\n* \u03c9 is the body's [[angular velocity]]\n* ''r'' is the distance of any mass ''dm'' from that line\n* <math>I\\,</math> is the body's [[moment of inertia]], equal to <math>\\int_Q {r^2}dm</math>.\n\n(In this equation the moment of [[inertia]] must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by \u03c9 must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).\n\n===Kinetic energy of systems===\nA system of bodies may have internal kinetic energy due to the relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the [[Solar System]] the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the bodies it contains.\n\nA macroscopic body that is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's [[center of momentum]]) may have various kinds of [[internal energy]] at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However all internal energies of all types contribute to body's mass, inertia, and total energy.\n\n===Fluid dynamics===\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], the kinetic energy per unit volume at each point in an incompressible fluid flow field is called the [[dynamic pressure]] at that point.<ref>A.M. Kuethe and J.D. Schetzer (1959) ''Foundations of Aerodynamics'', 2nd edition, p.53. John Wiley & Sons {{ISBN|0-471-50952-3}}</ref>\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2</math>\n\nDividing by V, the unit of volume:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{E_\\text{k}}{V} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{V}v^2 \\\\\n                     q &= \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>q</math> is the dynamic pressure, and \u03c1 is the density of the incompressible fluid.\n\n===Frame of reference===\n\nThe speed, and thus the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by choosing a suitable [[inertial frame of reference]]. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary to an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Introduction to the theory of relativity\n|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000sear_c2m9\n|url-access=registration\n|first1=Francis Weston\n|last1=Sears\n|first2=Robert W.\n|last2=Brehme\n|publisher=Addison-Wesley\n|year=1968\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000sear_c2m9/page/127 127]\n}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cpzvAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22in+its+own+rest+frame%22+%22kinetic+energy%22&q=%22in+its+own+rest+frame%22 Snippet view of page 127]\n</ref> By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case, the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's [[invariant mass]], which is independent of the reference frame.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of a system depends on the [[inertial frame of reference]]: it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a [[center of momentum frame]] and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the [[center of mass]].\n\nThis may be simply shown: let <math>\\textstyle\\mathbf{V}</math> be the relative velocity of the center of mass frame ''i'' in the frame ''k''. Since\n: <math>\n  v^2 = \\left(v_i + V\\right)^2\n      = \\left(\\mathbf{v}_i + \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{v}_i + \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n      = \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_i + 2 \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{V} + \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\mathbf{V}\n      = v_i^2 + 2 \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{V} + V^2,\n</math>\n\nThen,\n:<math>\n  E_\\text{k} = \\int \\frac{v^2}{2} dm = \\int \\frac{v_i^2}{2} dm + \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\int \\mathbf{v}_i dm + \\frac{V^2}{2} \\int dm.\n</math>\n\nHowever, let <math> \\int \\frac{v_i^2}{2} dm = E_i </math> the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame, <math> \\int \\mathbf{v}_i dm </math> would be simply the total momentum that is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: <math> \\int dm = M </math>.

In any different frame of reference, there is additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass. The kinetic energy of the system in the [[center of momentum frame]] is a quantity that is invariant (all observers see it to be the same).\n\n===Rotation in systems===\nIt sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body's center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass ([[rotational energy]]):\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = E_\\text{t} + E_\\text{r} \\,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''E''<sub>k</sub> is the total kinetic energy\n:''E''<sub>t</sub> is the translational kinetic energy\n:''E''<sub>r</sub> is the ''rotational energy'' or ''angular kinetic energy'' in the rest frame\n\nThus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.\n\n==Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies==\n{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}\n\nIf a body's speed is a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]], it is necessary to use relativistic mechanics to calculate its kinetic energy. In [[special relativity]] theory, the expression for linear momentum is modified.\n\nWith ''m'' being an object's [[rest mass]], '''v''' and ''v'' its velocity and speed, and ''c'' the speed of light in vacuum, we use the expression for linear momentum <math>\\mathbf{p} = m\\gamma \\mathbf{v}</math>, where <math>\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}</math>.\n\n[[Integration by parts|Integrating by parts]] yields\n:<math>E_\\text{k} =\n  \\int \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d \\mathbf{p} =\n  \\int \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d (m \\gamma \\mathbf{v}) =\n  m \\gamma \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} - \\int m \\gamma \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d \\mathbf{v} =\n  m \\gamma v^2 - \\frac{m}{2} \\int \\gamma d \\left(v^2\\right)\n</math>\n\nSince <math>\\gamma = \\left(1 - v^2/c^2\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}</math>,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  E_\\text{k} &= m \\gamma v^2 - \\frac{- m c^2}{2} \\int \\gamma d \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\\\\n             &= m \\gamma v^2 + m c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2} - E_0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>E_0</math> is a [[constant of integration]] for the [[indefinite integral]].\n\nSimplifying the expression we obtain\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  E_\\text{k} &= m \\gamma \\left(v^2 + c^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)\\right) - E_0 \\\\\n             &= m \\gamma \\left(v^2 + c^2 - v^2\\right) - E_0 \\\\\n             &= m \\gamma c^2 - E_0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>E_0</math> is found by observing that when <math>\\mathbf{v} = 0,\\ \\gamma = 1</math> and <math> E_\\text{k} = 0</math>, giving\n:<math>E_0 = m c^2 \\,</math>\n\nresulting in the formula\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = m \\gamma c^2 - m c^2 = \\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - m c^2</math>\n\nThis formula shows that the work expended accelerating an object from rest approaches infinity as the velocity approaches the speed of light. Thus it is impossible to accelerate an object across this boundary.\n\nThe mathematical by-product of this calculation is the [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula\u2014the body at rest must have energy content\n\n:<math>E_\\text{rest} = E_0 = m c^2 \\!</math>\n\nAt a low speed (''v'' \u226a ''c''), the relativistic kinetic energy is approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. This is done by [[binomial approximation]] or by taking the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] for the reciprocal square root:\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} \\approx m c^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) - m c^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2</math>\n\nSo, the total energy <math>E_k</math> can be partitioned into the rest mass energy plus the Newtonian kinetic energy at low speeds.\n\nWhen objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate. The next term in the Taylor series approximation\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} \\approx m c^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \\frac{3}{8} \\frac{v^4}{c^4}\\right) - m c^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \\frac{3}{8} m \\frac{v^4}{c^2}</math>\n\nis small for low speeds. For example, for a speed of {{convert|10|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} the correction to the Newtonian kinetic energy is 0.0417&nbsp;J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 50&nbsp;MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100&nbsp;km/s it is 417&nbsp;J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 5&nbsp;GJ/kg).\n\nThe relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is given by\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} - m c^2</math>\n\nThis can also be expanded as a [[Taylor series]], the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics:<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/qmech/Quantum/node107.html\n |title=Fine Structure of Hydrogen\n |first=Richard\n |last=Fitzpatrick\n |date=20 July 2010\n |work=Quantum Mechanics\n |accessdate=20 August 2016\n}}</ref>\n:<math>E_\\text{k} \\approx \\frac{p^2}{2 m} - \\frac{p^4}{8 m^3 c^2}.</math>\n\nThis suggests that the formulae for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but concepts emerging from the equivalence of mass and energy and the principles of relativity.\n\n===General relativity===\n{{see also|Schwarzschild geodesics}}\nUsing the convention that\n:<math>g_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, u^{\\alpha} \\, u^{\\beta} \\, = \\, - c^2</math>\n\nwhere the [[four-velocity]] of a particle is\n:<math>u^{\\alpha} \\, = \\, \\frac{d x^{\\alpha}}{d \\tau}</math>\n\nand <math>\\tau \\,</math> is the [[proper time]] of the particle, there is also an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle in [[general relativity]].\n\nIf the particle has momentum\n:<math>p_{\\beta} \\, = \\, m \\, g_{\\beta\\alpha} \\, u^{\\alpha}</math>\n\nas it passes by an observer with four-velocity ''u''<sub>obs</sub>, then the expression for total energy of the particle as observed (measured in a local inertial frame) is\n:<math>E \\, = \\, - \\, p_{\\beta} \\, u_{\\text{obs}}^{\\beta}</math>\n\nand the kinetic energy can be expressed as the total energy minus the rest energy:\n:<math>E_{k} \\, = \\, - \\, p_{\\beta} \\, u_{\\text{obs}}^{\\beta} \\, - \\, m \\, c^2 \\,.</math>\n\nConsider the case of a metric that is diagonal and spatially isotropic (''g''<sub>''tt''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ss''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ss''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ss''</sub>).

For one particle of mass ''m'', the kinetic energy operator appears as a term in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and is defined in terms of the more fundamental momentum operator <math>\\hat p</math>.
