He was the son and successor of [[Pacorus II]] ({{reign|78|110}}).\n\nVologases III's reign was marked by civil strife and warfare. At his ascension, he had to deal with the usurper [[Osroes I]] ({{reign|109|129}}), who managed to seize the western part of the empire, which left Vologases III in control of its eastern parts. After Osroes I violated the [[Treaty of Rhandeia]] with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] by appointing [[Parthamasiris of Armenia|Parthamasiris]] as the king of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] ({{reign|98|117}}) invaded the Parthian lands, briefly seizing the Parthian cities of [[Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]] and reaching as far as the [[Persian Gulf]]. These gains were short-lived; after Trajan's death in 117, all the Roman gains had been lost. Vologases III, whose eastern domains were untouched, took advantage of the weakened state of Osroes I to regain lost territory, and by 129 finally defeated him. Another contender named [[Mithridates V of Parthia|Mithridates V]] shortly appeared afterwards, but was also defeated by Vologases III, in 140.\n\nFrom 134 to 136, Vologases III had to face an invasion by the nomadic [[Alans]], while in the east, he sought to increase the political and military actions as a response to the enlargement of the [[Kushan Empire]]. Under the Roman emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] ({{reign|138|161}}), disturbance once occurred in Armenia due to the Romans appointing a new king in Armenia. Vologases III, however, did not protest, either due to not being powerful enough, or possibly because he did not want to put the thriving long-distance in jeopardy, from which the Parthian state was gaining hefty income from. In 147, Vologases III was succeeded by Mithridates V's son [[Vologases IV]].\n\n== Name ==\nVologases is the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] form of the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ''Walagash'' ({{lang|xpr|\ud802\udf45\ud802\udf4b\ud802\udf42\ud802\udf54}}).{{sfn|Chaumont|Schippmann|1988|pp=574\u2013580}} The name is also attested in [[New Persian]] as ''Bal\u0101sh'' and [[Middle Persian]] ''Ward\u0101khsh'' (also spelled ''Wal\u0101khsh'').{{sfn|Chaumont|Schippmann|1988|pp=574\u2013580}} The etymology of the name is unclear.

Sullivan died on April 24, 2001, of [[leukemia]] at a [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], hospital. He was 78.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn to Charles and Helen Sullivan in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. He was raised in a small house in a dirt alley called Washington Court in one of Charleston's poorest sections. His parents divorced when he was three years old and he grew up an only child. Sullivan has often re-told the event which set a course for the remainder of his life. At the age of twelve, he tried to purchase a [[Coca-Cola]] in a drugstore on Capitol Street. The proprietor refused to sell him the drink, saying: \"Stand on your feet, boy. You can't sit here.\" This incident inspired Sullivan's lifetime pursuit of fighting racial prejudice.\n\nSullivan also attributed much of his early influence to his grandmother:\n\n{{quote|... my grandmother Carrie, a constant and powerful presence in my life who taught me early on the importance of faith, determination, faith in God, and especially self-help.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Moving Mountains: The Principles and Purposes of Leon Sullivan\n| author=Sullivan, Leon H.\n| publisher=Judson Press\n| year=1998\n| isbn=978-0-8170-1289-2}}\n</ref>}}\n\nAs a teen-ager, Sullivan\u2014who as an adult stood 6&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in tall<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title= Leon Sullivan\n| publisher=Sunday Gazette-Mail\n| url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/africanamericans/sullivanleon02.html\n| accessdate=2007-02-11}}\n</ref>\u2014attended Charleston's Garnet High School for blacks and received a basketball and football scholarship to [[West Virginia State College]] in 1939 where he was a member of Tau chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

In 1943, during a visit to [[West Virginia]], noted black minister [[Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.|Adam Clayton Powell]] convinced Sullivan to move to [[New York City]] where he attended the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] (1943\u201345) and later [[Columbia University]] (Master's in Religion 1947). He also served as Powell's assistant minister at the [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]]. During this period, Sullivan met his wife Grace, a woman whom he referred to as \"Amazing Grace.\" The couple would eventually have three children, Hope, Julie and Howard. One of Sullivan's greater achievements during his time in New York was the recruitment of \"a hundred colored men for the police force\" in Harlem with [[Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s support and encouragement.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Build Brother Build\n| author=Sullivan, Leon H.\n| publisher=Macrae Smith Company\n| year=1969\n| isbn=978-0-8255-8460-2}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1945 Leon and Grace Sullivan moved to [[South Orange, New Jersey]], where Sullivan became pastor at First Baptist Church.

Only two companies responded positively so Sullivan, through his affiliation with other ministers, organized a boycott of various businesses which he referred to as \"Selective Patronage\". The slogan was \"Don't buy where you don't work\" and the boycott was extremely effective since blacks constituted about 20% of Philadelphia's population. Sullivan estimated the boycott produced thousands of jobs for African Americans in a period of four years. ''[[The New York Times]]'' featured the program with a front-page story, and later, ''[[Fortune magazine]]'' brought the program to greater public attention on a national scale. By 1962, the effectiveness of Sullivan's boycotts came to the attention of Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] who persuaded Sullivan to share information with them on his success. The exchange led to SCLC's economic arm, [[Operation Breadbasket]], in 1967, headed by [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title= The Black 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential African-Americans, Past and Present\n| author= Columbus Salley\n| publisher=Citadel Press\n| year=1998\n| isbn=978-0-8065-2048-3}}\n</ref>\n\n==Self-Help Movement==\nSullivan's work was built on the principle of \"[[self-help]]\", which provides people with the tools to help themselves overcome barriers of poverty and oppression. African Americans had been excluded from the types of training which led to better paying jobs. Sullivan realized that simply making jobs available was not enough. He said,\n\n{{quote|I found that we needed training. Integration without preparation is frustration.}}\n\nIn 1964, Sullivan founded [[Opportunities Industrialization Center]]s (OIC) of America in an abandoned jail house in [[North Philadelphia]]. The program took individuals with little hope and few prospects and offered them job training and instruction in life skills and then helped place them into jobs. The movement quickly spread around the nation. With sixty affiliated programs in thirty states and the District of Columbia, OIC has grown into a movement, which has served over two million disadvantaged and under-skilled people. This approach also led to the formation of the Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) in 1969.<ref>{{cite web\n| title= Founder and History\n| publisher=OIC International\n| url=http://www.oicinternational.org/index.php?page=history\n| accessdate=2007-01-26}}\n</ref>\n\nAround the same time, Sullivan established the Zion Investment Association (ZIA), a company which invested in and started new businesses. Sullivan also helped to establish more than 20 programs under the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH) (now headed by his daughter Dr. Julie Helen Sullivan), including the Global Sullivan Principles initiative. Other IFESH programs include the African-African American Summit (now renamed the Leon H. Sullivan Summit), the Peoples Investment Fund for Africa, the Self-Help Investment Program, Teachers for Africa and Schools for Africa. IFESH has placed teachers in Africa, trained African bankers, built schools, developed small businesses, disseminated books and school supplies, created literacy programs, distributed medicines to prevent river-blindness and helped to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\n==10-36 Plan==\n{{refimprove|section|date = March 2020}}\nInspired by a well-known parable from the [[Bible]], Sullivan decided to use the church as a vehicle for organizing the black community to consolidate its resources and build a [[community owned|community-owned]] economic base. In 1962, during one of his Sunday sermons, he introduced his congregation to his vision of self-help through community investment. \"One day I preached a sermon at Zion about Jesus feeding the five thousand with a few loaves and a few fish\", he recalls. \"Everybody put in their little bit and you had enough to feed everybody, and a whole lot left over. So I said, that is what I am going to do with the church and the community. I said, I am going to ask 50 people to put $10 down for 36 months of loaves and fishes and see if we could accumulate resources enough to build something that we would own ourselves.\" Although Rev. Sullivan had expected about 50 families to sign up for the 10-36 Plan, the response was overwhelming. Over 200 joined the plan that Sunday morning. His idea of bringing people together to invest in a community-owned enterprise had caught fire.\n\nThe concept of the 10-36 Plan was to create two separate legal entities. For the first 16 months of the subscription period, investors would contribute to the Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust (ZNPCT), a [[Community Development Corporation]] (CDC) that would support education, scholarships for youth, health services and other programs aimed at social uplift. For the remaining 20 months of the subscription period, investors would make payments to a for-profit corporation, Progress Investment Associates (PIA), which would undertake income-generating projects. At the end of 36 months, subscribers would receive one share of common voting stock and would be entitled to participate in yearly shareholders meetings. As William Downes, the treasurer of the 10-36 Plan and the executive director of ZNPCT explains, the idea of the voting system was to encourage community involvement in the plan.\n\nAccording to Sullivan's philosophy, it was important for people to begin by contributing to the nonprofit side of the effort in order to develop a psychology of giving before receiving.<ref name=ZNPCT>{{cite web\n| title= Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust (ZNPCT), Philadelphia, PA\n| publisher=Pratt Center for Community Development\n| url=http://www.prattcenter.net/cdc-znpct.php\n| accessdate=2007-01-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070629222112/http://www.prattcenter.net/cdc-znpct.php  |archivedate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>\nIt was also important for people to learn basic economic concepts and to see the 10-36 Plan as a long-term investment. Although stockholders were told that they would eventually receive a dividend, they were cautioned not to expect to obtain profits right away. Their most immediate monetary benefit would be a tax deduction for their contributions to the nonprofit. To participate in the 10-36 Plan, investors had to have faith in the idea of investing in a secure future for the next generation. Rev. Sullivan's vision was to use the tools of the free enterprise system to foster something that is vital to community progress - a sense of ownership and a stake in the common good.\n\nFunds accumulated rapidly under the 10-36 Plan, and were soon used to invest in numerous housing and economic development initiatives. In 1964, PIA made its first investment in an 8-unit apartment building in an all-white community. The rationale for buying this property was that it would help address a long-standing problem facing blacks - racial discrimination in housing. The leaders of the Progress Movement believed that money often has the power to speak louder than words in the struggle to improve race relations. One year after its first investment in housing, PIA built Zion Gardens, a middle-income garden apartment complex in North Philadelphia. The $1 million project was financed by using 10-36 funds to leverage a loan from the [[Federal Housing Administration]] and a grant from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).\n\nWhile pursuing these development projects, Zion continued to build an equity base through the 10-36 Plan. In 1965, the plan was opened to new subscribers from Zion's congregation, and another 450 joined. Over the years, the Progress Movement has had great success with its strategy of using equity accumulated under the 10-36 Plan to leverage funds from public and private sources, including commercial banks and insurance companies.<ref name=ZNPCT />\n\n==Progress Plaza==\nAfter establishing the OIC in the mid-1960s, Zion's next major undertaking was the fulfillment of Rev. Sullivan's dream of building the nation's first black-owned and developed shopping center, to be named [http://www.progressplaza.com Progress Plaza]. In addition to addressing his concern about the lack of black ownership of major businesses in America, the project would deal with the problem of unemployment in [[North Philadelphia]] by generating a substantial number of jobs. After convincing the city's [[Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority|Redevelopment Authority]] to donate land for the project, Rev. Sullivan set out to raise the capital needed to build the shopping center. \"So I went to the chairman of the bank and I said, I want a construction loan\", he recounts. \"He said, well Reverend, you need some equity for something like this. Think about it and come back later in two, three or four years, and let's see what we can do.\" Rev. Sullivan was already prepared for that challenge, however. \"Give me the sack\", he told Zion's treasurer, William Downes. \"I opened it up and $400,000 worth of equities came out\", he describes. \"The man's eye glasses fell off his eyes. He came around the table and took my hand and said, Reverend, we can work together.\" Rev. Sullivan's theory about the power of money to deal with persistent racial inequalities was proving to be correct. As he concludes:''\n\n{{quote|I found that $400,000 makes a difference in race relations in America!}}\n\nProgress Plaza, which is located on [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]], one of Philadelphia's main thoroughfares, was dedicated in 1968 before a crowd of 10,000 well-wishers. In some sense, the shopping center was the culmination of the Progress Movement's multiple goals. Because it was a major construction project, it created a large number of construction jobs for participants in the OIC program. Through an agreement negotiated with Progress Plaza's chain store tenants, the shopping center also made numerous management job opportunities available to African Americans. To fulfill another one of the Progress Movement's primary goals - to encourage the development of black-owned businesses - ZNPCT created an Entrepreneurial Training Center at Progress Plaza. With major funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the center was able to offer managerial and entrepreneurial skills training to hundreds of area residents. Today, over half of the 16 stores in Progress Plaza are black-owned businesses.\n\nAnother one of the Progress Movement's major goals was to address the social needs of [[North Philadelphia]]'s community residents. To this end, ZNPCT built a comprehensive Human Services Center that centralizes essential services so that they are easily accessible to area residents. Zion's role was to develop the property and lease it at below-market rent to nonprofit and governmental entities whose programs fulfill ZNPCT's charitable mission. Located adjacent to Progress Plaza, the Center currently houses a [[Social Security Administration]] office, an unemployment compensation office, a police training academy, and a health service center run by [[Temple University]].<ref name=\"ZNPCT\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, Progress Plaza was taken over by Wendell Whitlock of Progress Investment Associates, who is now the chairman emeritus.

He went on to serve on [[General Motors]]' board for over 20 years. In 1977, Sullivan developed a code of conduct for companies operating in [[South Africa]] called the [[Sullivan Principles]], as an alternative to complete [[disinvestment]]. As part of the Board of Directors at General Motors Sullivan lobbied GM and other large corporations to voluntarily withdrawal from doing business in South Africa while the [[Apartheid in South Africa|system of apartheid]] was still in effect.\n\nIn 1988, Sullivan retired from Zion Baptist Church. Sullivan was determined to provide a model of self-help and empowerment to the people of Africa. He began using his talent for bringing world leaders together to find solutions to international issues through the establishment of the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH)<ref name=\"ifesh2007\">{{cite web\n| title= IFESH\n| publisher=IFESH\n| url=http://www.ifesh.org/main.html\n| accessdate=2007-05-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207115950/http://www.ifesh.org/main.html  |archivedate = 2007-02-07}}\n</ref>\nin order to establish and maintain programs and activities in the areas of agriculture, business and economic development, democracy and governance, education and health. These programs would in turn help governments in sub-Saharan Africa reduce poverty and unemployment and build civil societies. To further expand human rights and economic development to all communities, Sullivan created the Global Sullivan Principles of Social Responsibility in 1997. In 1999, the Global Sullivan Principles were issued at the [[United Nations]]. This expanded code calls for multinational companies to take an active role in the advancement of human rights and social justice. Then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] had this to say about Sullivan's contributions:\n\n{{quote|It shows how much one individual can do to change lives and societies for the better ...

Since then, the biennial Leon H. Sullivan Summit has brought together the world's political and business leaders, delegates representing national and international civil and multinational organizations, and members of academic institutions in order to focus attention and resources on Africa's economic and social development. Their mission was inspired by Rev. Leon H. Sullivan's belief that the development of Africa is a matter of global partnerships. It was particularly important to Rev. Sullivan that Africa's Diaspora and Friends of Africa are active participants in Africa's development.<ref>{{cite web\n| title= The Leon H. Sullivan Summit\n| publisher=Leon H.

Sullivan died on April 24, 2001, of [[leukemia]] at a [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], hospital. He was 78.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn to Charles and Helen Sullivan in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. He was raised in a small house in a dirt alley called Washington Court in one of Charleston's poorest sections. His parents divorced when he was three years old and he grew up an only child. Sullivan has often re-told the event which set a course for the remainder of his life. At the age of twelve, he tried to purchase a [[Coca-Cola]] in a drugstore on Capitol Street. The proprietor refused to sell him the drink, saying: \"Stand on your feet, boy. You can't sit here.\" This incident inspired Sullivan's lifetime pursuit of fighting racial prejudice.\n\nSullivan also attributed much of his early influence to his grandmother:\n\n{{quote|... my grandmother Carrie, a constant and powerful presence in my life who taught me early on the importance of faith, determination, faith in God, and especially self-help.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Moving Mountains: The Principles and Purposes of Leon Sullivan\n| author=Sullivan, Leon H.\n| publisher=Judson Press\n| year=1998\n| isbn=978-0-8170-1289-2}}\n</ref>}}\n\nAs a teen-ager, Sullivan\u2014who as an adult stood 6&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in tall<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title= Leon Sullivan\n| publisher=Sunday Gazette-Mail\n| url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/africanamericans/sullivanleon02.html\n| accessdate=2007-02-11}}\n</ref>\u2014attended Charleston's Garnet High School for blacks and received a basketball and football scholarship to [[West Virginia State College]] in 1939 where he was a member of Tau chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

In 1943, during a visit to [[West Virginia]], noted black minister [[Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.|Adam Clayton Powell]] convinced Sullivan to move to [[New York City]] where he attended the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] (1943\u201345) and later [[Columbia University]] (Master's in Religion 1947). He also served as Powell's assistant minister at the [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]]. During this period, Sullivan met his wife Grace, a woman whom he referred to as \"Amazing Grace.\" The couple would eventually have three children, Hope, Julie and Howard. One of Sullivan's greater achievements during his time in New York was the recruitment of \"a hundred colored men for the police force\" in Harlem with [[Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s support and encouragement.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Build Brother Build\n| author=Sullivan, Leon H.\n| publisher=Macrae Smith Company\n| year=1969\n| isbn=978-0-8255-8460-2}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1945 Leon and Grace Sullivan moved to [[South Orange, New Jersey]], where Sullivan became pastor at First Baptist Church.

Only two companies responded positively so Sullivan, through his affiliation with other ministers, organized a boycott of various businesses which he referred to as \"Selective Patronage\". The slogan was \"Don't buy where you don't work\" and the boycott was extremely effective since blacks constituted about 20% of Philadelphia's population. Sullivan estimated the boycott produced thousands of jobs for African Americans in a period of four years. ''[[The New York Times]]'' featured the program with a front-page story, and later, ''[[Fortune magazine]]'' brought the program to greater public attention on a national scale. By 1962, the effectiveness of Sullivan's boycotts came to the attention of Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] who persuaded Sullivan to share information with them on his success. The exchange led to SCLC's economic arm, [[Operation Breadbasket]], in 1967, headed by [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title= The Black 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential African-Americans, Past and Present\n| author= Columbus Salley\n| publisher=Citadel Press\n| year=1998\n| isbn=978-0-8065-2048-3}}\n</ref>\n\n==Self-Help Movement==\nSullivan's work was built on the principle of \"[[self-help]]\", which provides people with the tools to help themselves overcome barriers of poverty and oppression. African Americans had been excluded from the types of training which led to better paying jobs. Sullivan realized that simply making jobs available was not enough. He said,\n\n{{quote|I found that we needed training. Integration without preparation is frustration.}}\n\nIn 1964, Sullivan founded [[Opportunities Industrialization Center]]s (OIC) of America in an abandoned jail house in [[North Philadelphia]]. The program took individuals with little hope and few prospects and offered them job training and instruction in life skills and then helped place them into jobs. The movement quickly spread around the nation. With sixty affiliated programs in thirty states and the District of Columbia, OIC has grown into a movement, which has served over two million disadvantaged and under-skilled people. This approach also led to the formation of the Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) in 1969.<ref>{{cite web\n| title= Founder and History\n| publisher=OIC International\n| url=http://www.oicinternational.org/index.php?page=history\n| accessdate=2007-01-26}}\n</ref>\n\nAround the same time, Sullivan established the Zion Investment Association (ZIA), a company which invested in and started new businesses. Sullivan also helped to establish more than 20 programs under the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH) (now headed by his daughter Dr. Julie Helen Sullivan), including the Global Sullivan Principles initiative. Other IFESH programs include the African-African American Summit (now renamed the Leon H. Sullivan Summit), the Peoples Investment Fund for Africa, the Self-Help Investment Program, Teachers for Africa and Schools for Africa. IFESH has placed teachers in Africa, trained African bankers, built schools, developed small businesses, disseminated books and school supplies, created literacy programs, distributed medicines to prevent river-blindness and helped to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\n==10-36 Plan==\n{{refimprove|section|date = March 2020}}\nInspired by a well-known parable from the [[Bible]], Sullivan decided to use the church as a vehicle for organizing the black community to consolidate its resources and build a [[community owned|community-owned]] economic base. In 1962, during one of his Sunday sermons, he introduced his congregation to his vision of self-help through community investment. \"One day I preached a sermon at Zion about Jesus feeding the five thousand with a few loaves and a few fish\", he recalls. \"Everybody put in their little bit and you had enough to feed everybody, and a whole lot left over. So I said, that is what I am going to do with the church and the community. I said, I am going to ask 50 people to put $10 down for 36 months of loaves and fishes and see if we could accumulate resources enough to build something that we would own ourselves.\" Although Rev. Sullivan had expected about 50 families to sign up for the 10-36 Plan, the response was overwhelming. Over 200 joined the plan that Sunday morning. His idea of bringing people together to invest in a community-owned enterprise had caught fire.\n\nThe concept of the 10-36 Plan was to create two separate legal entities. For the first 16 months of the subscription period, investors would contribute to the Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust (ZNPCT), a [[Community Development Corporation]] (CDC) that would support education, scholarships for youth, health services and other programs aimed at social uplift. For the remaining 20 months of the subscription period, investors would make payments to a for-profit corporation, Progress Investment Associates (PIA), which would undertake income-generating projects. At the end of 36 months, subscribers would receive one share of common voting stock and would be entitled to participate in yearly shareholders meetings. As William Downes, the treasurer of the 10-36 Plan and the executive director of ZNPCT explains, the idea of the voting system was to encourage community involvement in the plan.\n\nAccording to Sullivan's philosophy, it was important for people to begin by contributing to the nonprofit side of the effort in order to develop a psychology of giving before receiving.<ref name=ZNPCT>{{cite web\n| title= Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust (ZNPCT), Philadelphia, PA\n| publisher=Pratt Center for Community Development\n| url=http://www.prattcenter.net/cdc-znpct.php\n| accessdate=2007-01-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070629222112/http://www.prattcenter.net/cdc-znpct.php  |archivedate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>\nIt was also important for people to learn basic economic concepts and to see the 10-36 Plan as a long-term investment. Although stockholders were told that they would eventually receive a dividend, they were cautioned not to expect to obtain profits right away. Their most immediate monetary benefit would be a tax deduction for their contributions to the nonprofit. To participate in the 10-36 Plan, investors had to have faith in the idea of investing in a secure future for the next generation. Rev. Sullivan's vision was to use the tools of the free enterprise system to foster something that is vital to community progress - a sense of ownership and a stake in the common good.\n\nFunds accumulated rapidly under the 10-36 Plan, and were soon used to invest in numerous housing and economic development initiatives. In 1964, PIA made its first investment in an 8-unit apartment building in an all-white community. The rationale for buying this property was that it would help address a long-standing problem facing blacks - racial discrimination in housing. The leaders of the Progress Movement believed that money often has the power to speak louder than words in the struggle to improve race relations. One year after its first investment in housing, PIA built Zion Gardens, a middle-income garden apartment complex in North Philadelphia. The $1 million project was financed by using 10-36 funds to leverage a loan from the [[Federal Housing Administration]] and a grant from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).\n\nWhile pursuing these development projects, Zion continued to build an equity base through the 10-36 Plan. In 1965, the plan was opened to new subscribers from Zion's congregation, and another 450 joined. Over the years, the Progress Movement has had great success with its strategy of using equity accumulated under the 10-36 Plan to leverage funds from public and private sources, including commercial banks and insurance companies.<ref name=ZNPCT />\n\n==Progress Plaza==\nAfter establishing the OIC in the mid-1960s, Zion's next major undertaking was the fulfillment of Rev. Sullivan's dream of building the nation's first black-owned and developed shopping center, to be named [http://www.progressplaza.com Progress Plaza]. In addition to addressing his concern about the lack of black ownership of major businesses in America, the project would deal with the problem of unemployment in [[North Philadelphia]] by generating a substantial number of jobs. After convincing the city's [[Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority|Redevelopment Authority]] to donate land for the project, Rev. Sullivan set out to raise the capital needed to build the shopping center. \"So I went to the chairman of the bank and I said, I want a construction loan\", he recounts. \"He said, well Reverend, you need some equity for something like this. Think about it and come back later in two, three or four years, and let's see what we can do.\" Rev. Sullivan was already prepared for that challenge, however. \"Give me the sack\", he told Zion's treasurer, William Downes. \"I opened it up and $400,000 worth of equities came out\", he describes. \"The man's eye glasses fell off his eyes. He came around the table and took my hand and said, Reverend, we can work together.\" Rev. Sullivan's theory about the power of money to deal with persistent racial inequalities was proving to be correct. As he concludes:''\n\n{{quote|I found that $400,000 makes a difference in race relations in America!}}\n\nProgress Plaza, which is located on [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]], one of Philadelphia's main thoroughfares, was dedicated in 1968 before a crowd of 10,000 well-wishers. In some sense, the shopping center was the culmination of the Progress Movement's multiple goals. Because it was a major construction project, it created a large number of construction jobs for participants in the OIC program. Through an agreement negotiated with Progress Plaza's chain store tenants, the shopping center also made numerous management job opportunities available to African Americans. To fulfill another one of the Progress Movement's primary goals - to encourage the development of black-owned businesses - ZNPCT created an Entrepreneurial Training Center at Progress Plaza. With major funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the center was able to offer managerial and entrepreneurial skills training to hundreds of area residents. Today, over half of the 16 stores in Progress Plaza are black-owned businesses.\n\nAnother one of the Progress Movement's major goals was to address the social needs of [[North Philadelphia]]'s community residents. To this end, ZNPCT built a comprehensive Human Services Center that centralizes essential services so that they are easily accessible to area residents. Zion's role was to develop the property and lease it at below-market rent to nonprofit and governmental entities whose programs fulfill ZNPCT's charitable mission. Located adjacent to Progress Plaza, the Center currently houses a [[Social Security Administration]] office, an unemployment compensation office, a police training academy, and a health service center run by [[Temple University]].<ref name=\"ZNPCT\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, Progress Plaza was taken over by Wendell Whitlock of Progress Investment Associates, who is now the chairman emeritus.

He went on to serve on [[General Motors]]' board for over 20 years. In 1977, Sullivan developed a code of conduct for companies operating in [[South Africa]] called the [[Sullivan Principles]], as an alternative to complete [[disinvestment]]. As part of the Board of Directors at General Motors Sullivan lobbied GM and other large corporations to voluntarily withdrawal from doing business in South Africa while the [[Apartheid in South Africa|system of apartheid]] was still in effect.\n\nIn 1988, Sullivan retired from Zion Baptist Church. Sullivan was determined to provide a model of self-help and empowerment to the people of Africa. He began using his talent for bringing world leaders together to find solutions to international issues through the establishment of the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH)<ref name=\"ifesh2007\">{{cite web\n| title= IFESH\n| publisher=IFESH\n| url=http://www.ifesh.org/main.html\n| accessdate=2007-05-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207115950/http://www.ifesh.org/main.html  |archivedate = 2007-02-07}}\n</ref>\nin order to establish and maintain programs and activities in the areas of agriculture, business and economic development, democracy and governance, education and health. These programs would in turn help governments in sub-Saharan Africa reduce poverty and unemployment and build civil societies. To further expand human rights and economic development to all communities, Sullivan created the Global Sullivan Principles of Social Responsibility in 1997. In 1999, the Global Sullivan Principles were issued at the [[United Nations]]. This expanded code calls for multinational companies to take an active role in the advancement of human rights and social justice. Then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] had this to say about Sullivan's contributions:\n\n{{quote|It shows how much one individual can do to change lives and societies for the better ... He was known and respected throughout the world for the bold and innovative role he played in the global campaign to dismantle the system of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite news\n| last = Wilson\n| first = Kendall\n| title = Leon Sullivan's Living Legacy\n| publisher = The Philadelphia Tribune\n| date = 2001-04-27}}\n</ref>}}\n\n==Leon H. Sullivan Summit==\nSullivan organized the first Summit in [[Abidjan]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] in 1991 as a result of a number of requests and conversations he had with African leaders seeking an honest dialog among and between leaders of African countries and government officials and leaders from developed countries. Since then, the biennial Leon H. Sullivan Summit has brought together the world's political and business leaders, delegates representing national and international civil and multinational organizations, and members of academic institutions in order to focus attention and resources on Africa's economic and social development. Their mission was inspired by Rev. Leon H. Sullivan's belief that the development of Africa is a matter of global partnerships. It was particularly important to Rev. Sullivan that Africa's Diaspora and Friends of Africa are active participants in Africa's development.<ref>{{cite web\n| title= The Leon H. Sullivan Summit\n| publisher=Leon H.

{"title_page": "Cimarron (novel)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[Image:CimarronNovel.JPG|thumb|First edition ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]]) ]]\n'''''Cimarron''''' is a novel by [[Edna Ferber]], published in April [[1930 in literature|1930]] and based on development in Oklahoma after the Land Rush. The book was adapted into a critically acclaimed [[Cimarron (1931 film)|film]] of the same name in [[1931 in film|1931]] through [[RKO Pictures]]. In [[1960 in film|1960]], the story was again adapted for the screen by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], to meager success.\n\n==Background==\n\n===The Land Rush===\n{{main article|Oklahoma Land Race}}\nThe [[Land Rush of 1889|Oklahoma Land Rush]] (also called the Oklahoma Land Race and [[Cherokee Strip]] [[Land Run]]) plays a pivotal role in both the novel and film adaptations. \"[[Manifest destiny]]\" and the desperation of the settlers involved in the rush provides the opening drama and sets the stage for the twists and turns in the book. Every settler is desperate to stake his claim on the best piece of land (near water).\n\n[[Image:OkLandRush.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Photograph of the 1893 [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Land Race|Land Rush]], depicted in Ferber's book and films.]]\n\n''Cimarron'' involves two land runs. [[Land Run of 1889|The first]], for the [[Unassigned Lands]], occurred on April 22, 1889. [[Land Run of 1893|The second]], for the Cherokee Outlet (commonly called the Cherokee Strip) occurred in 1893.  The piece of land in question had been allotted to the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] as part of the 1828 [[Treaty of New Echota]], while the rest of the [[Oklahoma Territory]] had been opened to settlers. As commerce grew across the area of [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]], cattlemen became increasingly annoyed by the presence of the [[Cherokee]] on prime land that they wanted to use to drive cattle from northern ranches to [[Texas]]. Some of this annoyance with the Native people can be attributed to the decision made by the Cherokees to side with the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  In the 1880s, the government attempted to lease the land for cattle ranching, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] refused. Eventually, the Cherokee people did sell the land to the government.\n\nThroughout the remaining years of the 1880s various cattle associations and ranches fought over the land. Disputes even turned deadly, as large cattle companies and small ranchers both claimed the land as their own. This eventually led to a ban on cattle ranching in the area, and in 1893 the land, 58 miles (93&nbsp;km) wide by 225 miles (362&nbsp;km) long, was opened to homesteaders. The land was divided into 42,000 claims, and each [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] had to literally stake (put a stake with a white flag attached) their claim, and pick up a certificate back at the starting place. Nearly 100,000 people arrived for the rush, and over half of them would be sent back home after the day was through.\n\n==The novel==\n''Cimarron'' derives its name from the [[Cimarron Territory]]. The Cimarron Territory was an unrecognized name for the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|No Man's Land]], an unsettled area of the West and Midwest, especially lands once inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]] such as the [[Cherokee]] and [[Sioux]]. In 1886 the government declared such lands open to settlement. At the time of the novel's opening, [[Oklahoma]] is one such \"Cimarron Territory,\" though in actuality the historical setting of the novel is somewhere in the [[Cherokee Outlet]], also known as the [[Cherokee Strip]], and probably the city of [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe novel is set in the Oklahoma of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It follows the lives of Yancey and Sabra Cravat, beginning with Yancey's tale of his participation in the [[Oklahoma Land Race|1893 land rush]]. They emigrate from [[Wichita, Kansas]], to the fictional town of Osage, Oklahoma with their son Cim and\u2014unknowingly\u2014a black boy named Isaiah. In Osage, the Cravats print their newspaper, the ''Oklahoma Wigwam'', and build their fortune amongst Indian disputes, outlaws, and the discovery of oil in [[Oklahoma]].\n\nUpon its publication, ''Cimarron'' was a sensation in America and came to epitomize an era in [[American history]]. It was the best selling novel of 1930,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahnscorner.com/2013/06/1930-cimarron-by-edna-ferber.html|title=1930: Cimarron by Edna Ferber|last=Kahn|first=Matt|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> as it provided readers an outlet to escape their present suffering in the [[Great Depression]]. This novel became Ferber's third successful novel and paved the way for many more Ferber-penned historical epics, and it was published as an [[Armed Services Edition]] during WWII.\n\nWhile it became seen as a triumphant feminist story detailing Sabra Cravat's growth from a traditional American housewife into a successful leader and politician, Ferber has stated in her autobiography, ''[[A Peculiar Treasure]]'', that the novel was originally intended as a satirical criticism of American womanhood and American sentimentality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Ann R. |last2= |first2= |date=2002 |title=Edna Ferber, Jewish American Feminist |url= |journal=Shofar |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=52-60 |doi= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ferber |first=Edna |date=1938 |title=A Peculiar Treasure |url= |location= |publisher=Doubleday, Doran, & Co. |page=330 |isbn= |author-link= Edna Ferber }}</ref> Throughout the novel, Sabra's practice of imperial domesticity can be seen in her attempts to \"civilize\" Native Americans by forcing them to adopt white values, and her fixation on expanding her own sphere of influence, which as a woman, was traditionally her home.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zink |first1=Amanda |last2= |first2= |date=2012 |title=Peyote in the Kitchen: Gendered Identities and Imperial Domesticity in Edna Ferber's Cimarron |url= |journal=Western American Literature |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=66-86 |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThe character of Yancey Cravat is based on [[Temple Lea Houston]], last child of Texas icon [[Sam Houston]]. Temple Houston was a brilliant trial lawyer known for his flamboyant courtroom theatrics. He was also a competent gunfighter who killed at least one man in a stand-up shootout.\n\n===The author===\n{{main article|Edna Ferber}}\nBorn on August 15, 1885, in [[Michigan]], Ferber had lived through the latter development of the West. She grew up on the stories of her parents and grandparents, who had moved west from [[New York (state)|New York]] many years before her birth.\n\nHer writing career began as a journalist, and Ferber published her first novel in 1911. Ferber's early works were mostly light romance. Her ''So Big'' (1924) brought Ferber more recognition as a novelist.  This novel about love and sacrifice in the Midwest earned Ferber a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. She immersed herself in writing historical epics, including ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'', set on and around the [[Mississippi River]], and ''Cimarron'' in 1930.\n\n==Films==\n\n===1931 film===\n{{main article|Cimarron (1931 film)}}\n\n[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] had long since taken notice of writer Edna Ferber's talents. The first Ferber adaptation came in [[1918 in film|1918]] with the silent ''Our Mrs. McChesney'', based on a play Ferber had written. ''So Big'' was released as a film the same year it was published as a novel, and adaptations of ''Gigolo'' and ''Show Boat'' also followed. With the advent of sound, Ferber adaptations had even more promise. Immediately following its publication, many production companies courted Ferber. Ferber ended up selling the film rights to [[RKO Pictures]] in [[1930 in film|1930]] for a record $125,000 (a large sum even for today).\n\nDespite America being in the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], RKO immediately prepared for a big-budget picture, investing more than $1.5 million into Ferber's novel ''Cimarron''. Director [[Wesley Ruggles]] would direct stars [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] and [[Irene Dunne]] with a script written by [[Howard Estabrook]]. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at the [[Jasmin Quinn Ranch]] outside of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The film was a massive production, especially the land rush scenes, which recalled the epic scenes of ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]'' some fifteen years earlier. More than 5,000 extras, twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers were used to capture scenes of wagons racing across grassy hills and prairies. Cinematographer [[Edward Cronjager]] spent overtime planning out every scene in accordance to Ferber's descriptions.\n\nThe film was premiered in [[New York City]] on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and a Los Angeles premiere followed on February 6. Three days later the film was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the high budget and ongoing Great Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO could not recoup their investment in the film.\n\n===1960 film===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cimarron1960.jpg|110px|framed|right|Movie poster for 1960 film.]] -->\n{{main article|Cimarron (1960 film)}}\n\nThe remake of ''Cimarron'' included many changes from the Ferber novel and especially from the 1931 film. With the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gaining momentum, the script, written by [[Arnold Schulman]], took a kinder approach to Native Americans. Schulman gave the people more dignity and recognized that they were losing land that was rightfully theirs through the 1893 land rush that was the film's centerpiece. He also introduced several minor characters, such as journalist Sam Pegler ([[Robert Keith (actor)|Robert Keith]]) and Wes Jennings ([[Vic Morrow]]), a prominent member of Cherokee Kid's ([[Russ Tamblyn]]) gang.\n\nIn 1961 the film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] (art directors [[George Davis (art director)|George W. Davis]] and [[Addison Hehr]]) and [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]], but failed to win either. ''Cimarron'' marked the end of the Ferber adaptations.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*  ''[[Far and Away]]'' (1992), starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman\n*  ''[[Oklahoma Land Race]]'' (1893)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{cite book | author=Bart, Peter | title=Fade Out: The Calamitous Final Days of MGM | publisher=Anchor Books | year=1991 | isbn=0-385-41892-2}}\n* {{cite book | author=Ferber, Edna | title=Cimarron | publisher=Grosset & Dunlap | year=1930 | isbn=1-199-73350-4}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Jewell, Richard B. |author2=Harbin, Vernon | title=The RKO Story | publisher=Arlington House | year=1982 | isbn=0-517-54656-6}}\n* {{cite book | author=Neibaur, James L. | title=The RKO Features | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2005 | isbn=0-7864-2166-5}}\n\n==Book Reviews==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140130053403/http://anotherlookbook.com/cimarron-edna-ferber/ Another look book] (Archived)\n*[http://www.kahnscorner.com/2013/06/1930-cimarron-by-edna-ferber.html Kahn's Corner]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202191218/http://qcpages.qc.edu/Biology/LahtiSites/greatlit/contempus/ferber/cimarron.htm Reflections on Great Literature]\n\n{{Edna Ferber}}\n[[Category:1930 American novels]]\n[[Category:American historical novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Doubleday (publisher) books]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1890s]]\n[[Category:Western (genre) novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n[[Image:CimarronNovel.JPG|thumb|First edition ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]]) ]]\n'''''Cimarron''''' is a novel by [[Edna Ferber]], published in April [[1930 in literature|1930]] and based on development in Oklahoma after the Land Rush.

To reach another person on the Internet, you need to type an address \u2013 a name or number \u2013 into your computer or other device. That address must be unique so computers know where to find each other. <abbr>ICANN</abbr> helps coordinate and support these unique identifiers across the world.  \n\nICANN follows a bottom-up, multistakeholder model in which individuals, non-commercial stakeholder groups, industry, and governments play important roles in its community-based, consensus-driven, policymaking approach. ICANN\u2019s multistakeholder community is a volunteer-based, open collection of global stakeholders that work together through a bottom-up process to give advice, make policy recommendations, conduct reviews, and propose implementation solutions for common problems within ICANN\u2019s mission and scope.\n\nPolicy recommendations are developed and refined by the ICANN community through its Supporting Organizations (SOs) and influenced by Advisory Committees (ACs). The community is made up of volunteers from across the world and from many different backgrounds, including businesses, Internet engineers, technical experts, civil society, governments, end users, and many others.\n\nMuch of its work has concerned the Internet's global [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), including policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic [[top-level domains]] (TLDs), and the operation of [[root name server]]s.  The numbering facilities ICANN manages include the [[Internet Protocol]] address spaces for [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]], and assignment of address blocks to [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]]. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.\n\nICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]], consensus-based processes.<ref name=\"Memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Commerce and Internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers\"/>\n\nICANN's creation was announced publicly on September 17, 1998,<ref>{{cite web|last=Postel|first=Jonathan|title=A Brief Explanation of the Joint IANA and NSI Documents Defining the New Internet Corporation|url=http://www.netsol.com:80/policy/icann/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219132906/http://www.netsol.com:80/policy/icann/|archive-date=1999-02-19}}</ref> and it formally came into being on September 30, 1998, incorporated in the U.S. state of California.<ref name=\"kepler.ss.ca.gov\"/> Originally headquartered in [[Marina del Rey]] in the same building as the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI), its offices are now in the [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles|Playa Vista]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\n==History==\nBefore the establishment of ICANN, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function of administering registries of Internet protocol identifiers (including the distributing top-level domains and IP addresses) was performed by [[Jon Postel]], a Computer Science researcher who had been involved in the creation of [[ARPANET]], first at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and then at USC-ISI.<ref name=\"V.

After an open letter from ICANN issuing an ultimatum to VeriSign, later endorsed by the [[Internet Architecture Board]],<ref name=\"Wildcard entries in DNS entries\"/> the company voluntarily ended the service on October 4, 2003. After this action, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN on February 27, 2004, claiming that ICANN had exceeded its authority. By this lawsuit, VeriSign sought to reduce ambiguity about ICANN's authority. The antitrust component of VeriSign's claim was dismissed during August 2004. VeriSign's challenge that ICANN overstepped its contractual rights is currently outstanding. A proposed settlement already approved by ICANN's board would resolve VeriSign's challenge to ICANN in exchange for the right to increase pricing on .com domains. At the meeting of ICANN in Rome, which took place from March 2 to 6, 2004, ICANN agreed to ask approval of the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] for the [[Waiting List Service]] of VeriSign.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nOn May 17, 2004, ICANN published a proposed budget for the year 2004\u201305. It included proposals to increase the openness and professionalism of its operations, and greatly increased its proposed spending from US$8.27&nbsp;million to $15.83&nbsp;million. The increase was to be funded by the introduction of new [[top-level domain]]s, charges to [[Domain name registry|domain registries]], and a fee for some domain name registrations, renewals and transfers (initially USD 0.20 for all domains within a country-code top-level domain, and USD 0.25 for all others).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries]] (CENTR), which represents the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|Internet registries]] of 39 countries, rejected the increase, accusing ICANN of a lack of financial prudence and criticizing what it describes as ICANN's \"unrealistic political and operational targets\". Despite the criticism, the registry agreement for the top-level domains <tt>jobs</tt> and <tt>travel</tt> includes a US$2 fee on every domain the licensed companies sell or renew.<ref name=\"theregister\"/>\n\nAfter a second round of negotiations during 2004, the TLDs <tt>[[.eu|eu]]</tt>, <tt>[[.asia|{{not a typo|asia}}]]</tt>, <tt>[[.travel|travel]]</tt>, <tt>[[.jobs|jobs]]</tt>, <tt>[[.mobi|mobi]]</tt>, and <tt>[[.cat|cat]]</tt> were introduced during 2005.\n\n[[Image:Cerf's Up-marquee-20071031.jpg|thumb|ICANN meeting, Los Angeles USA, 2007.

However, the KnujOn report details how various registrars have not complied with their contractual obligations under the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).<ref name=\"icann2\"/> The main point of the KnujOn research was to demonstrate the relationships between compliance failure, illicit product traffic, and spam. The report demonstrated that out of 900 ICANN accredited registrars, fewer than 20 held 90% of the web domains advertised in spam. These same registrars were also most frequently cited by KnujOn as failing to resolve complaints made through the Whois Data Problem Reporting System (WDPRS).\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the ICANN Board started a [[.events|new process of TLD naming policy]] to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.\" This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well a new application and implementation process.<ref name=\"32nd International Public ICANN Meeting\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 2008, ICANN issued breach notices against Joker and Beijing Innovative Linkage Technology Ltd.<ref name=\"icann3\"/> after further researching reports and complaints issued by KnujOn.

As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.<ref name=\"participation\"/>\n\nICANN [[List of ICANN meetings|holds periodic public meetings]] rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time. However, there are criticisms from ICANN constituencies including the Noncommercial Users Constituency (NCUC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gnso.icann.org/about/stakeholders-constituencies/ncsg/ncuc|title=Non-Commercial Users \u2013 Generic Names Supporting Organization|website=gnso.icann.org}}</ref> and the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC) that there is not enough [[Freedom of information legislation|public disclosure]] and that too many discussions and decisions take place out of sight of the public.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nDuring the early 2000s, there had been speculation that the United Nations might assume control of ICANN,<ref name=\"U.N. Summit to Focus on Internet\"/> followed by a negative reaction from the U.S. government<ref name=\"2005-07-us\"/> and worries about a division of the Internet.<ref name=\"Power grab could split the net\"/> The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunisia during November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to establish an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently established to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.<ref name=\"icann_gac\"/>\n\nSome have attempted to argue that ICANN was never given the authority to decide policy, e.g., choose new TLDs or exclude other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Activities==\n===Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)===\nOne task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, domain registrants must agree to be bound by the UDRP\u2014they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.\n\nExamination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some<ref name=\"vjolt\"/> to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.\n\n===Proposed elimination of public DNS whois===\nIn 2013, the initial report of ICANN's Expert Working Group has recommended that the present form of [[Whois]], a utility that allows anyone to know who has registered a domain name on the Internet, should be \"abandoned\". It recommends it be replaced with a system that keeps most registration information secret (or \"gated\") from most Internet users, and only discloses information for \"permissible purposes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/groups/other/gtld-directory-services/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|publisher=ICANN Expert Working Group|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin|title=Whois \"killer\" is a recipe for a clusterfuck|url=http://domainincite.com/16855-whois-killer-is-a-recipe-for-a-clusterfuck|accessdate=June 21, 2014|publisher=Domain Incite|date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain name research, domain name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.<ref>[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ Intellectual Property Solutions & Legal Support Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054828/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ |date=September 21, 2013 }}.

As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.<ref name=\"participation\"/>\n\nICANN [[List of ICANN meetings|holds periodic public meetings]] rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time.

Summit to Focus on Internet\"/> followed by a negative reaction from the U.S. government<ref name=\"2005-07-us\"/> and worries about a division of the Internet.<ref name=\"Power grab could split the net\"/> The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunisia during November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to establish an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently established to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.<ref name=\"icann_gac\"/>\n\nSome have attempted to argue that ICANN was never given the authority to decide policy, e.g., choose new TLDs or exclude other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Activities==\n===Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)===\nOne task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, domain registrants must agree to be bound by the UDRP\u2014they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.\n\nExamination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some<ref name=\"vjolt\"/> to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.\n\n===Proposed elimination of public DNS whois===\nIn 2013, the initial report of ICANN's Expert Working Group has recommended that the present form of [[Whois]], a utility that allows anyone to know who has registered a domain name on the Internet, should be \"abandoned\". It recommends it be replaced with a system that keeps most registration information secret (or \"gated\") from most Internet users, and only discloses information for \"permissible purposes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/groups/other/gtld-directory-services/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|publisher=ICANN Expert Working Group|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin|title=Whois \"killer\" is a recipe for a clusterfuck|url=http://domainincite.com/16855-whois-killer-is-a-recipe-for-a-clusterfuck|accessdate=June 21, 2014|publisher=Domain Incite|date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain name research, domain name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.<ref>[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ Intellectual Property Solutions & Legal Support Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054828/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ |date=September 21, 2013 }}.
