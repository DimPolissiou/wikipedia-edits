Although they outnumbered the Christians both in numbers and in property, they submitted in 1126 to the victorious King [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]], who showed himself favorably disposed toward them.\n\nIn 1160 many of them settled in the neighboring city of [[Palencia]].\n\nThe Jewish community of Carrion was so large in 1290 that it paid 92,000 [[maravedi]]s in taxes, not much less than the amount paid by the community of Burgos. In Carrion, as elsewhere, the Jews were persecuted.

In 1960, the council published its first report, named after Coldstrean, which proposed and set out requirements for a new Diploma in Art and Design (Dip.A.D.), such as written essays and written examinations, and \"helped to change the structure of art school teaching in Britain\".<ref name=\"Importance of writing\"/><ref name=\"ODArt\">{{cite book|author=Ian Chilvers|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Art|isbn=0-19-860476-9}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the study carried out by Lockheart, and her own experience as a practitioner or studio artist \u2013 rather than a theorist \u2013 however, the recommendation of academic writing for practitioners contained in the ''Coldstream Reports'' were misread and, as a result, strong and \u2013 according to Lockheart, unfounded \u2013 beliefs were formed among academics and those in managerial positions throughout the [[Higher Education]] (HE) sector.<ref name=\"Importance of writing\"/>\n\nLockheart posits that \"upholding these institutional assumptions may have an impact on how writing is used as a component of examination and therefore aligned with the need for academic parity across the HE sector, rather than as a tool for understanding\nand articulating practice.\"<ref name=\"Importance of writing\"/> \"As a result,\" she continues, \"this article calls for the reinstatement of a unified HE art and design curriculum to be filled with a diversity of [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] [teaching] approaches, including writing practices, that are complementary to and inform the purposes of creative practice.\"<ref name=\"Importance of writing\"/>\n\nAs a result of this controversial mis-reading of the first report and a later report published in 1970, in 1970 \"the Department of Education and Science ... recommended the humanities style academic thesis or dissertation as a part of the move from the [old] Diploma in Design to ...\" the new Diploma in Art and Design (Dip.A.D.), and these mis-readings have \"caused writing to be used as an examinable measure rather than as a tool for learning\", to its detriment.<ref name=\"Importance of writing\"/>\n\n=== Academic literacies ===\nIn a paper co-written with J.

Lockheart argues that while academic literacies and writing practices are well-established in older, traditional academic disciplines, more recent disciplines such as art and design have been forced to adopt these existing academic practices or to justify their own distinctive practices, and this has been a contentious issue in the discipline of art and design (which includes diverse fields, each with their diferences and their own requirements, such as fine arts, graphic design and fashion design).<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and Design\"/>\n\nIt is in this spirit that Lockheart teaches Contextual Practice, and primarily for this reason that she co-founded an academic network, Writing-PAD, to provide a platform for these new ideas and practices (see below).<ref

\"to promote discussion about the necessary balance of consensus and dissensus that art and design fields require to remain vibrant.\"<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and

These include self-navigated game drives, a large picnic area, fishing, swimming and kayaking on the Breede River, mountain biking (along reserve's gravel roads, or a dedicated 9&nbsp;km MTB trail) and several marked walking/hiking trails.\n\nThree hiking trails start near the rest camp (accessible for day visitors from a dedicated parking area, or via a short link path from the overnight camp):\n - The Acacia Trail is a circular route of approximately 1.6&nbsp;km which is mostly flat, circling through acacia veldt\n - The Aloe Hill Trail is a circular route of approximately 3.3&nbsp;km (2.7&nbsp;km if leaving from the rest camp) which passes the original building of Lang Elsie's Kraal (c. 1734-1800) before climbing a small hill, returning along the river with a few easy rocky scrambles\n - The Bushbuck Trail, a 5.4&nbsp;km out-and-return route along the river from the trailhead to Die Stroom (the picnic area) and return\nFurther inland from the river, the Blue Crane Trail is a 3.2&nbsp;km route along a jeep track, passing some of the small dams.  A fifth circular trail of about 6&nbsp;km, the Termite Loop, commences near Die Stroom and climbs a long gentle incline before crossing Western Drive and descending back to the river.\n\nThe Park is a good location for birding, with over 200 species recorded.  Large species commonly see here are the Denham's (Stanley's) Bustard, Blue Crane, Spur-winged Goose and Secretary Bird.  Other noteworthy species are [[Malachite Sunbird|Malachite]] and [[Southern Double-Collared Sunbird]], [[Fiscal Flycatcher]], [[Klaas's Cuckoo]], [[Acacia Pied Barbet]], [[Red-faced Mousebird]] and [[Pearl-breasted Swallow]].\n\nDay visitors can access all areas of the park except for the Lang Elsies Kraal Rest Camp.  However, a dedicated picnic area at Die Stroom has ablutions, braai (barbecue) facilities, a children's play area, and access to the river to swim, fish or kayak.\n\n==Accommodation in the Park==\n\nAll accommodation is located at the Lang Elsie's Kraal Rest Camp, on the banks of the Breede River.  Fourteen one- and two- bedroom wooden cottages are complemented by multiple camping stands, available with or without electricity points.  Stands suitable for caravans are also available.  All accommodation booking is through SANParks.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n* [http://www.sanparks.org/parks/bontebok/ South African National Parks (official site)]\n\n{{South African National Parks}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:IUCN Category II]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1961]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of the Western Cape]]\n[[Category:National parks of South Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|National park near Swellendam in the Western Cape, South Africa}}\n{{Infobox protected area\n| name = Bontebok National Park\n| photo = Bontebok PA020073 .JPG\n| photo_caption = [[Bontebok]]\n| map = South Africa\n| relief = 1\n| map_caption = Location of the park\n| location = [[Western Cape]], [[South Africa]]\n| nearest_city = [[Swellendam]]\n| coordinates = {{coords|34|04|S|20|27|E|region:ZA-WC|display=inline, title}}\n| area = {{convert|27.86|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| established = 1931\n| governing_body = [[South African National Parks]]\n| url = http://www.sanparks.org/parks/bontebok/\n}}\n\n'''Bontebok National Park''' is a species-specific [[national park]] in [[South Africa]].

These include self-navigated game drives, a large picnic area, fishing, swimming and kayaking on the Breede River, mountain biking (along reserve's gravel roads, or a dedicated 9 km MTB trail) and several marked walking/hiking trails.\n\nThree hiking trails start near the rest camp (accessible for day visitors from a dedicated parking area, or via a short link path from the overnight camp):\n - The Acacia Trail is a circular route of approximately 1.6 km which is mostly flat, circling through acacia veldt\n - The Aloe Hill Trail is a circular route of approximately 3.3 km (2.7 km if leaving from the rest camp) which passes the original building of Lang Elsie's Kraal (c. 1734-1800) before climbing a small hill, returning along the river with a few easy rocky scrambles\n - The Bushbuck Trail, a 5.4 km out-and-return route along the river from the trailhead to Die Stroom (the picnic area) and return\nFurther inland from the river, the Blue Crane Trail is a 3.2 km route along a jeep track, passing some of the small dams.  A fifth circular trail of about 6 km, the Termite Loop, commences near Die Stroom and climbs a long gentle incline before crossing Western Drive and descending back to the river. \n\n\nThe Park is a good location for birding, with over 200 species recorded.  Large species commonly see here are the Denham's (Stanley's) Bustard, Blue Crane, Spur-winged Goose and Secretary Bird.  Other noteworthy species are [[Malachite Sunbird|Malachite]] and [[Southern Double-Collared Sunbird]], [[Fiscal Flycatcher]], [[Klaas's Cuckoo]], [[Acacia Pied Barbet]], [[Red-faced Mousebird]] and [[Pearl-breasted Swallow]].\n\nDay visitors can access all areas of the park except for the Lang Elsies Kraal Rest Camp.  However, a dedicated picnic area at Die Stroom has ablutions, braai (barbecue) facilities, a children's play area, and access to the river to swim, fish or kayak.\n\n==Accommodation in the Park==\n\nAll accommodation is located at the Lang Elsie's Kraal Rest Camp, on the banks of the Breede River.  Fourteen one- and two- bedroom wooden cottages are complemented by multiple camping stands, available with or without electricity points.  Stands suitable for caravans are also available.  All accommodation booking is through SANParks.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n* [http://www.sanparks.org/parks/bontebok/ South African National Parks (official site)]\n\n{{South African National Parks}}\n\n[[Category:IUCN Category II]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1961]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of the Western Cape]]\n[[Category:National parks of South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bontebok_National_Park"}

It lies in the [[Puna de Atacama]], a region of tall volcanic peaks on a high [[plateau]] close to the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the driest places in the world. It is the [[List of volcanoes by elevation|second highest active volcano in the world]] after [[Ojos del Salado]].\n\nLlullaillaco formed during two different phases in the [[Pleistocene]]-[[Holocene]] out of [[dacitic]] [[lava flow]]s. The oldest rocks are about 1.5 million years old. About 150,000 years ago, the volcano's southeastern flank collapsed, generating a [[debris avalanche]] that reached as far as {{convert|25|km}} from the summit. The youngest dated rocks were erupted 5,600 \u00b1 250 years ago in the summit region, but there are reports of activity from the 19th century.\n\nThe mountain's first recorded climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs and a number of archeological sites were found on the mountain and at its feet; Llullaillaco marks the highest archeological site in the world. In 1999, the [[mummy|mummified]] remains of three children, known as the [[Children of Llullaillaco]], were found at its summit. They are presumed to have been [[human sacrifice]]s. The occurrence of mice in the summit region has been reported as well.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe name ''Llullaillaco'' is derived from the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] word {{transl|que|llulla}} meaning \"false\", \"lie\" or \"deceitful\" and {{transl|que|yaku}} or {{transl|que|llaco}} meaning \"water\".{{sfn|Vitry|2016|p=5}} This name probably refers to the [[meltwater]] from snow, which flows down the slopes but then is absorbed into the soil.<ref name=\"Cienfuegos1899\" /> Normally such mountains are sources for water.{{sfn|Vitry|2016|p=5}} Another translation in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] is \"hot water\".<ref name=\"Bobylyova2016\" />\n\n== Geography and geology ==\n\nVolcanism in the Andes is caused by the [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Antarctic Plate]] beneath the [[South America Plate]]. The Nazca Plate subducts at a speed of {{convert|7|-|9|cm/yr}} and the Antarctic Plate at a speed of {{convert|2|cm/yr}}. Volcanism does not occur along a continuous chain; there are four separate regions named: the [[Northern Volcanic Zone]], the [[Central Volcanic Zone]], the [[Southern Volcanic Zone]], and the [[Austral Volcanic Zone]]. The formation of [[magma]] results from the release of [[water]] and other [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile]] material from the subducting plate, which is then injected into the above-lying [[mantle wedge]]. The volcanic zones are separated by areas where the subducting plate subducts at a flatter angle and volcanism is absent. The Peruvian [[Flat-slab subduction|flat slab]] between the Northern and the Central Volcanic Zones is associated with the subduction of the [[Nazca Ridge]], the Pampean flat slab between the Central and the Southern Volcanic Zone is associated with the subduction of the [[Juan Fernandez Ridge]], and the Patagonian volcanic gap between the Southern and the Austral Volcanic Zone is associated with the [[Chile Triple Junction]].<ref name=\"Stern2004\" />\n\nAbout 178 volcanoes are found in the [[Andes]], 60 of which have been active in historical times. In addition, large [[caldera]]s and [[Monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic]] volcanoes exist in the Andes.<ref name=\"Stern2004\" />\n\n=== Local setting ===\n\nLlullaillaco is part of the Central Volcanic Zone.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=89}} At least 44 volcanic centres with historical activity and 18 large caldera-forming volcanoes have been identified in the Central Volcanic Zone.<ref name=\"Stern2004\" /> Volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone mostly occurs on the [[Altiplano]] and the [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]]. A number of volcanoes there reach heights of over {{convert|6000|m}} above sea level.

Elsewhere these layers are buried by [[Cenozoic]] rocks.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=91}} There are several [[fault (geology)|fault]]s in the region, such as the Imilac-Salina del Fraile [[lineament]] whose movement has influenced the activity of Llullaillaco.<ref name=\"Naranjo2018\" />\n\n=== Composition ===\n\nLlullaillaco has mostly erupted dacites with medium [[potassium]] content, with rocks becoming more [[felsic]] the younger they are.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=93}} Rock samples taken from Llullaillaco are mostly [[porphyritic]] or [[Vitrophyre|vitrophyric]], with a glassy or microcrystalline [[matrix (geology)|matrix]]. [[Phenocryst]]s are mostly [[plagioclase]], with [[mafic]] phenocrysts being dominated by [[orthopyroxene]] and smaller amounts of [[biotite]], [[clinopyroxene]], and [[hornblende]].

Richards and M. Villeneuve has allowed the determination of the geological history of the region. Had volcanism during the [[Eocene]] and Oligocene been centered on the [[Precordillera]], increased subduction of the Nazca Plate during the late Oligocene caused the [[volcanic arc]] to broaden to about {{convert|250|km}}. 25 million years ago, the \"Quechua event\" triggered the uplift of the Puna-Altiplano, a highland covering a surface area of {{convert|500000|km2}} and reaching an altitude of {{convert|3700|m}}. In the late Miocene-Pliocene a phase of strong ignimbrite volcanism occurred. About 2 million years ago, the \"Diaguita deformation\" was characterized by a change in the deformation regimen from [[crustal shortening]] to [[strike-slip fault]]ing and of volcanism from voluminous felsic eruptions to isolated stratovolcanoes and [[back-arc]] mafic volcanism. A slowdown in the subduction may have caused this change. Nowadays most volcanism occurs at the western edge of the Puna, where volcanoes such as [[Lascar (volcano)|Lascar]] and Llullaillaco formed.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=89}}{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2002|p=173}}\n\n== Climate, glaciers and biota ==\n\nThe climate at Llullaillaco is cold and dry.<ref name=\"Mignone2010\" /> The average temperature is about {{convert|-13|C}},{{sfn|Previgliano|Ceruti|Reinhard|Araoz|2003|p=1473}} with temperature maximums ranging {{convert|-8|-|-13|C}} between summer and winter.{{sfn|Lazar|2005|p=181}} Ground temperatures however can reach {{convert|12.5|C}} during the day in summer.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=239}} The temperature of the ground fluctuates strongly during the day.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=238}} The climate is extremely sunny on account of the lack of a [[cloud cover]], the high altitude, and the close coincidence between [[summer solstice]] with the [[perihelion|day where Earth is closest to the Sun]].{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=236}} [[Snowfall]] can occur down to altitudes of {{convert|4000|m}}.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=246}} Precipitation is episodic to the point that it is difficult to give average values.{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=9}} It is most often associated with either [[convective]] or [[cyclone|cyclonic]] activity during summer and winter respectively.{{sfn|Lazar|2005|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Llullaillaco del sur (25932614263).jpg|thumb|Snow patches on Llullaillaco]]\nSmall glaciers are found above {{convert|6000|m}} altitude.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=79}} Other sources contend there are no glaciers on Llullaillaco, which would make it the highest mountain in the world without one;{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=4}} although the existence of an ice slab on the western slope was reported in 1958.{{sfn|Hastenrath|1971|p=257}} However, Llullaillaco has snow fields.{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=5}} {{convert|1|-|1.5|m}} high [[penitente (snow formation)|penitente]]s occur above {{convert|5000|m}} altitude,{{sfn|Vimercati|Solon|Krinsky|Ar\u00e1n|2019|p=191}} especially in more sheltered areas.{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=13}} {{convert|1|m}} high penitentes were observed in 1954.<ref name=\"Lliboitry1954\" /> [[Snow]] covers the terrain above {{convert|5400|-|5800|m}} altitude.<ref name=\"Mignone2010\" /> [[Gully|Gullies]] that are found in the area probably result from meltwater runoff.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2002|p=175}} The snowfields on Llullaillaco supply water to the Salar de Punta Negra.<ref name=\"Lynch1986\" />\n\nThe existence of a [[cirque]] on the northwestern slope has been postulated.{{sfn|Hastenrath|1971|p=262}} It was once believed that Llullaillaco had experienced three large glaciations,{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=251}} but the \"[[moraine]]s\" are actually [[mudflow]] deposits.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=253}} However, during the Pleistocene glaciers reached down to {{convert|5100|m}} altitude on the northwestern slope.

It lies in the [[Puna de Atacama]], a region of tall volcanic peaks on a high [[plateau]] close to the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the driest places in the world. It is the [[List of volcanoes by elevation|second highest active volcano in the world]] after [[Ojos del Salado]].\n\nLlullaillaco formed during two different phases in the [[Pleistocene]]-[[Holocene]] out of [[dacitic]] [[lava flow]]s. The oldest rocks are about 1.5 million years old. About 150,000 years ago, the volcano's southeastern flank collapsed, generating a [[debris avalanche]] that reached as far as {{convert|25|km}} from the summit. The youngest dated rocks were erupted 5,600 \u00b1 250 years ago in the summit region, but there are reports of activity from the 19th century.\n\nThe mountain's first recorded climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs and a number of archeological sites were found on the mountain and at its feet; Llullaillaco marks the highest archeological site in the world. In 1999, the [[mummy|mummified]] remains of three children, known as the [[Children of Llullaillaco]], were found at its summit. They are presumed to have been [[human sacrifice]]s. The occurrence of mice in the summit region has been reported as well.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe name ''Llullaillaco'' is derived from the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] word {{transl|que|llulla}} meaning \"false\", \"lie\" or \"deceitful\" and {{transl|que|yaku}} or {{transl|que|llaco}} meaning \"water\".{{sfn|Vitry|2016|p=5}} This name probably refers to the [[meltwater]] from snow, which flows down the slopes but then is absorbed into the soil.<ref name=\"Cienfuegos1899\" /> Normally such mountains are sources for water.{{sfn|Vitry|2016|p=5}} Another translation in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] is \"hot water\".<ref name=\"Bobylyova2016\" />\n\n== Geography and geology ==\n\nVolcanism in the Andes is caused by the [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Antarctic Plate]] beneath the [[South America Plate]]. The Nazca Plate subducts at a speed of {{convert|7|-|9|cm/yr}} and the Antarctic Plate at a speed of {{convert|2|cm/yr}}. Volcanism does not occur along a continuous chain; there are four separate regions named: the [[Northern Volcanic Zone]], the [[Central Volcanic Zone]], the [[Southern Volcanic Zone]], and the [[Austral Volcanic Zone]]. The formation of [[magma]] results from the release of [[water]] and other [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile]] material from the subducting plate, which is then injected into the above-lying [[mantle wedge]]. The volcanic zones are separated by areas where the subducting plate subducts at a flatter angle and volcanism is absent. The Peruvian [[Flat-slab subduction|flat slab]] between the Northern and the Central Volcanic Zones is associated with the subduction of the [[Nazca Ridge]], the Pampean flat slab between the Central and the Southern Volcanic Zone is associated with the subduction of the [[Juan Fernandez Ridge]], and the Patagonian volcanic gap between the Southern and the Austral Volcanic Zone is associated with the [[Chile Triple Junction]].<ref name=\"Stern2004\" />\n\nAbout 178 volcanoes are found in the [[Andes]], 60 of which have been active in historical times.

Richards and M. Villeneuve has allowed the determination of the geological history of the region. Had volcanism during the [[Eocene]] and Oligocene been centered on the [[Precordillera]], increased subduction of the Nazca Plate during the late Oligocene caused the [[volcanic arc]] to broaden to about {{convert|250|km}}. 25 million years ago, the \"Quechua event\" triggered the uplift of the Puna-Altiplano, a highland covering a surface area of {{convert|500000|km2}} and reaching an altitude of {{convert|3700|m}}. In the late Miocene-Pliocene a phase of strong ignimbrite volcanism occurred. About 2 million years ago, the \"Diaguita deformation\" was characterized by a change in the deformation regimen from [[crustal shortening]] to [[strike-slip fault]]ing and of volcanism from voluminous felsic eruptions to isolated stratovolcanoes and [[back-arc]] mafic volcanism. A slowdown in the subduction may have caused this change. Nowadays most volcanism occurs at the western edge of the Puna, where volcanoes such as [[Lascar (volcano)|Lascar]] and Llullaillaco formed.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=89}}{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2002|p=173}}\n\n== Climate, glaciers and biota ==\n\nThe climate at Llullaillaco is cold and dry.<ref name=\"Mignone2010\" /> The average temperature is about {{convert|-13|C}},{{sfn|Previgliano|Ceruti|Reinhard|Araoz|2003|p=1473}} with temperature maximums ranging {{convert|-8|-|-13|C}} between summer and winter.{{sfn|Lazar|2005|p=181}} Ground temperatures however can reach {{convert|12.5|C}} during the day in summer.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=239}} The temperature of the ground fluctuates strongly during the day.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=238}} The climate is extremely sunny on account of the lack of a [[cloud cover]], the high altitude, and the close coincidence between [[summer solstice]] with the [[perihelion|day where Earth is closest to the Sun]].{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=236}} [[Snowfall]] can occur down to altitudes of {{convert|4000|m}}.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=246}} Precipitation is episodic to the point that it is difficult to give average values.{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=9}} It is most often associated with either [[convective]] or [[cyclone|cyclonic]] activity during summer and winter respectively.{{sfn|Lazar|2005|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Llullaillaco del sur (25932614263).jpg|thumb|Snow patches on Llullaillaco]]\nSmall glaciers are found above {{convert|6000|m}} altitude.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2001|p=79}} Other sources contend there are no glaciers on Llullaillaco, which would make it the highest mountain in the world without one;{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=4}} although the existence of an ice slab on the western slope was reported in 1958.{{sfn|Hastenrath|1971|p=257}} However, Llullaillaco has snow fields.{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=5}} {{convert|1|-|1.5|m}} high [[penitente (snow formation)|penitente]]s occur above {{convert|5000|m}} altitude,{{sfn|Vimercati|Solon|Krinsky|Ar\u00e1n|2019|p=191}} especially in more sheltered areas.{{sfn|Schroder|Makki|2000|p=13}} {{convert|1|m}} high penitentes were observed in 1954.<ref name=\"Lliboitry1954\" /> [[Snow]] covers the terrain above {{convert|5400|-|5800|m}} altitude.<ref name=\"Mignone2010\" /> [[Gully|Gullies]] that are found in the area probably result from meltwater runoff.{{sfn|Richards|Villeneuve|2002|p=175}} The snowfields on Llullaillaco supply water to the Salar de Punta Negra.<ref name=\"Lynch1986\" />\n\nThe existence of a [[cirque]] on the northwestern slope has been postulated.{{sfn|Hastenrath|1971|p=262}} It was once believed that Llullaillaco had experienced three large glaciations,{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=251}} but the \"[[moraine]]s\" are actually [[mudflow]] deposits.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|Schmidt|1997|p=253}} However, during the Pleistocene glaciers reached down to {{convert|5100|m}} altitude on the northwestern slope.

This allows the tyre to quickly displace the water between the ground and the rubber on the tyre. If this water is not displaced, the car will experience an effect known as [[Hydroplaning (tyres)|hydroplaning]] as the rubber will not be in contact with the ground. These grooves do not help the car grip contrary to popular belief, however if these grooves are too shallow, the grip will be impaired in wet conditions as the rubber will not be able to make good contact with the ground. The patterns are designed to displace water as quickly as possible to the edges of the tyre or into specially cut channels in the centre of the tyre. Not all groove patterns are the same. Optimal patterns depend on the car and the conditions. The grooves are also designed to generate heat when lateral forces are applied to the tyre.\n\n===Rubber===\n\nRain tyres are also made from softer [[Natural rubber|rubber]] compounds to help the car grip in the slippery conditions and to build up heat in the tyre. These tyres are so soft that running them on a dry track would cause them to deteriorate within minutes. Softer rubber means that the rubber contains more oils and other chemicals which cause a racing tyre to become sticky when it is hot. The softer a tyre, the stickier it becomes, and conversely with hard tyres.\n\nWhen rain has stopped falling, and a track is in the process of drying, it is not unusual to see drivers intentionally driving through wet puddles and damp portions of the course, in order to cool the rubber and stave off tyre deterioration.

Former Formula One tyre supplier [[Bridgestone]] referred to the \"intermediate\" tyre as the \"wet\" tyre, and to what are known as \"full wets\" as \"monsoon tyres\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Tires}}\n\n[[Category:Tires]]\n[[Category:Vehicle modifications]]\n", "name_user": "NASCARfan0548", "label": "safe", "comment": "Addingshort description: \"Tyres used in wet weather\" (Shortdesc helper)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_tyre"}

He is the current manager of [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]] club [[NK Tabor Se\u017eana|Tabor Se\u017eana]].\n\nCamoranesi began his career in Argentina in 1995, where he played for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Aldosivi|Aldosivi]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Banfield|Banfield]], also having spells in Mexico with [[Santos Laguna]] and [[Cruz Azul]], and in Uruguay with [[Montevideo Wanderers|Wanderers]]. In 2000, he moved to Italy, joining [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Verona]], where his performances earned him a transfer to defending [[Serie A]] champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2002. Camoranesi won the league title and the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] in his first season with the club, also reaching the Champions League final; he spent most of his career with the Turin side, also winning a second Supercoppa Italiana during his eight seasons with the ''Bianconeri''. In 2010, he joined German side [[VfB Stuttgart]] for a season, before returning to Argentina to play for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas|Lan\u00fas]], and subsequently [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]], where he retired in 2014. Following his retirement, Camoranesi began his managerial career later that year, and has since coached Mexican club [[Coras de Tepic]] and Argentine side [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Tigre|Tigre]].\n\nBorn and raised in Argentina, Camoranesi represented [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at international level, making his debut in 2003. With Italy, he took part at [[UEFA Euro 2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008]], and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]; he also took part in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], and was a member of Italy's winning squad at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nCamoranesi had always been a big fan of the Argentinian club [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] growing up, but as a youngster, he played in the squad of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Aldosivi]]. Aldosivi is situated in [[Mar del Plata]] just 100 miles away from Camoranesi's birthplace of [[Tandil]]. However, he moved to [[Mexico]] to begin his professional playing career at [[Santos Laguna]] during the 1995&ndash;96 season and scored one goal in 13 games for the team; Santos Laguna fans nicknamed him \"El Cholo\".<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Banfield===\nMore travels came for the young Argentine the following year, as he moved to Uruguayan club [[Montevideo Wanderers F.C.|Montevideo Wanderers]] briefly, before returning to his homeland to play for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Banfield|Banfield]] in 1997, solidifying himself as an impressive attacking right midfielder, while playing 38 games with 16 goals.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Cruz Azul===\nThe following season, Camoranesi returned to Mexico as a member of club [[Cruz Azul]], where he played from 1998 to 2000, making over 60 appearances and scoring 20 goals.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Verona===\nHe caught the attention of Italian [[Serie A]] side [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Verona]] by scoring 21 goals in 79 games with Cruz Azul, an impressive achievement for a midfielder. He moved to Italy in 2000, signing with Verona where he played for two years, helping the club avoid relegation in his [[2000\u201301 Serie A|first season]] with 4 goals in 22 appearances.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Juventus===\n[[File:Mauro Germ\u00e1n Camoranesi - Juventus Football Club.jpg|thumbnail|Camoranesi wearing Juventus' shirt in 2008]]\nIn 2002, Camoranesi was signed by Juventus on a [[co-ownership (football)|co-ownership deal]]; initially Juventus agreed a price of \u20ac1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/wps/wcm/connect/5d92d56d-a37b-45fc-91c3-49912284c194/28_ott_2003_eng.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=5d92d56d-a37b-45fc-91c3-49912284c194|title=Reports and Financial Statements at 30 June 2003|date=28 October 2003|accessdate=8 May 2012|publisher=Juventus FC|language=Italian}}</ref> in cash plus player deal (which [[Max Vieri]] was sold for \u20ac517,000 (or 1 billion lire) plus \u20ac2.324 million cash (or 4.5 billion lire cash)) On 26 June 2003, he was signed outright by the ''Bianconeri'' on a permanent basis for an additional fee of \u20ac5 million; this was the same day Juventus signed [[Marco Di Vaio]] in similar deal.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nCamoranesi soon established himself into the starting line-up on the right wing, following an injury to [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], and in his first season with the club, he won the [[2002\u201303 Serie A]] title, and the [[2002 Supercoppa Italiana]], also reaching the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]]; the following season, he also added the [[2003 Supercoppa Italiana]] to his trophy cabinet. Camoranesi also won two more Serie A titles with Juventus in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2005\u201306]] seasons, but Juventus were stripped of both of those titles as result of their involvement in the [[2006 Italian football scandal]], and relegated to [[Serie B]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nDespite his agent Sergio Fortunato linking the player to clubs such as [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] over the summer of 2006, following Juventus's relegation, Camoranesi made an announcement himself in September, pledging loyalty to Juventus \"''In January, I will not ask to be sold; I'm happy to stay here.\"'',<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravo.co.uk/footballitalia/newsdetail.php?n=694&p=1 |title=Football Italia @ Bravo |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608213547/http://www.bravo.co.uk/footballitalia/newsdetail.php?n=694&p=1 |archivedate=8 June 2008 }}</ref> he stated.\n\nCamoranesi put on some notable performances and contributed to a number of notable goals for Juventus during the [[2006\u201307 Serie B]] season, scoring 4 in total, as Juventus won the title and earned promotion back to the Italian top flight.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/> Against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in April 2007, he performed an impressive piece of skill similar to a [[Cruyff turn]], turning the ball through a defender's legs on the wing, before retrieving it to help set up Juventus's first goal of the match.

He is the current manager of [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]] club [[NK Tabor Se\u017eana|Tabor Se\u017eana]].\n\nCamoranesi began his career in Argentina in 1995, where he played for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Aldosivi|Aldosivi]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Banfield|Banfield]], also having spells in Mexico with [[Santos Laguna]] and [[Cruz Azul]], and in Uruguay with [[Montevideo Wanderers|Wanderers]]. In 2000, he moved to Italy, joining [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Verona]], where his performances earned him a transfer to defending [[Serie A]] champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2002. Camoranesi won the league title and the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] in his first season with the club, also reaching the Champions League final; he spent most of his career with the Turin side, also winning a second Supercoppa Italiana during his eight seasons with the ''Bianconeri''. In 2010, he joined German side [[VfB Stuttgart]] for a season, before returning to Argentina to play for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas|Lan\u00fas]], and subsequently [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]], where he retired in 2014. Following his retirement, Camoranesi began his managerial career later that year, and has since coached Mexican club [[Coras de Tepic]] and Argentine side [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Tigre|Tigre]].\n\nBorn and raised in Argentina, Camoranesi represented [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at international level, making his debut in 2003. With Italy, he took part at [[UEFA Euro 2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008]], and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]; he also took part in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], and was a member of Italy's winning squad at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nCamoranesi had always been a big fan of the Argentinian club [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] growing up, but as a youngster, he played in the squad of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Aldosivi]]. Aldosivi is situated in [[Mar del Plata]] just 100 miles away from Camoranesi's birthplace of [[Tandil]]. However, he moved to [[Mexico]] to begin his professional playing career at [[Santos Laguna]] during the 1995&ndash;96 season and scored one goal in 13 games for the team; Santos Laguna fans nicknamed him \"El Cholo\".<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Banfield===\nMore travels came for the young Argentine the following year, as he moved to Uruguayan club [[Montevideo Wanderers F.C.|Montevideo Wanderers]] briefly, before returning to his homeland to play for [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Banfield|Banfield]] in 1997, solidifying himself as an impressive attacking right midfielder, while playing 38 games with 16 goals.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Cruz Azul===\nThe following season, Camoranesi returned to Mexico as a member of club [[Cruz Azul]], where he played from 1998 to 2000, making over 60 appearances and scoring 20 goals.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Verona===\nHe caught the attention of Italian [[Serie A]] side [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Verona]] by scoring 21 goals in 79 games with Cruz Azul, an impressive achievement for a midfielder. He moved to Italy in 2000, signing with Verona where he played for two years, helping the club avoid relegation in his [[2000\u201301 Serie A|first season]] with 4 goals in 22 appearances.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n===Juventus===\n[[File:Mauro Germ\u00e1n Camoranesi - Juventus Football Club.jpg|thumbnail|Camoranesi wearing Juventus' shirt in 2008]]\nIn 2002, Camoranesi was signed by Juventus on a [[co-ownership (football)|co-ownership deal]]; initially Juventus agreed a price of \u20ac1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/wps/wcm/connect/5d92d56d-a37b-45fc-91c3-49912284c194/28_ott_2003_eng.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=5d92d56d-a37b-45fc-91c3-49912284c194|title=Reports and Financial Statements at 30 June 2003|date=28 October 2003|accessdate=8 May 2012|publisher=Juventus FC|language=Italian}}</ref> in cash plus player deal (which [[Max Vieri]] was sold for \u20ac517,000 (or 1 billion lire) plus \u20ac2.324 million cash (or 4.5 billion lire cash)) On 26 June 2003, he was signed outright by the ''Bianconeri'' on a permanent basis for an additional fee of \u20ac5 million; this was the same day Juventus signed [[Marco Di Vaio]] in similar deal.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nCamoranesi soon established himself into the starting line-up on the right wing, following an injury to [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], and in his first season with the club, he won the [[2002\u201303 Serie A]] title, and the [[2002 Supercoppa Italiana]], also reaching the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]]; the following season, he also added the [[2003 Supercoppa Italiana]] to his trophy cabinet. Camoranesi also won two more Serie A titles with Juventus in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2005\u201306]] seasons, but Juventus were stripped of both of those titles as result of their involvement in the [[2006 Italian football scandal]], and relegated to [[Serie B]].<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nDespite his agent Sergio Fortunato linking the player to clubs such as [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] over the summer of 2006, following Juventus's relegation, Camoranesi made an announcement himself in September, pledging loyalty to Juventus \"''In January, I will not ask to be sold; I'm happy to stay here.\"'',<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravo.co.uk/footballitalia/newsdetail.php?n=694&p=1 |title=Football Italia @ Bravo |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608213547/http://www.bravo.co.uk/footballitalia/newsdetail.php?n=694&p=1 |archivedate=8 June 2008 }}</ref> he stated.\n\nCamoranesi put on some notable performances and contributed to a number of notable goals for Juventus during the [[2006\u201307 Serie B]] season, scoring 4 in total, as Juventus won the title and earned promotion back to the Italian top flight.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/> Against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in April 2007, he performed an impressive piece of skill similar to a [[Cruyff turn]], turning the ball through a defender's legs on the wing, before retrieving it to help set up Juventus's first goal of the match.

He scored 5 goals in 22 appearances, and also won the [[Guerin d'Oro]] award, as the player with the highest average rating, for his performances throughout the season.<ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\nCamoranesi changed back to number 16 jersey ahead of the [[2008\u201309 Serie A]] season, and also extended his contract for another year.
