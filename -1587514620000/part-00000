R<sub>ST</sub> is based on the number of repeat differences between [[allele]]s at each [[microsatellite]] [[locus (genetics)|locus]] and is proposed to be better for most typical sample sizes, when data consist of variation at microsatellite [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or of [[nucleotide sequence]] ([[haplotype]]) information, the method may be unreliable unless a large number of loci are used. A nonsignificant test suggests that F<sub>ST</sub> should be preferred or when there is high gene flow within populations, F<sub>ST</sub> calculations are based on allele identity, it is likely to perform better than counterparts based on allele size information, the method depends on mutation rate, sometimes can likely provide biased estimate, but R<sub>ST</sub> will not perform necessarily better. A Bulgarian and other population studies observed concluded that when there is not much differiation, both statistical means show similar results, otherwise R<sub>ST</sub> is often superior to the F<sub>ST</sub>.

Being the dominant group in the Ottoman Empire for the next five centuries, they played an important part in the economic and cultural life of the land. Waves of impoverished Turks settled fertile lands, while Bulgarian families left their strategic settlements and resettled in more remote places. According to the historian Halil Inalcik, the Ottomans ensured significant Turkish presence in forward urban outposts such as [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], [[Kyustendil]], [[Silistra]], [[Trikala]], [[Skopje]] and [[Vidin]] and their vicinity.

That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt [[Christian name]]s and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign was unclear; however, many experts believed that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor.<ref name=autogenerated1>Glenn E.

During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would be issued only in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity removed. Mosques were closed or demolished. Turkish names on gravestones were replaced with Bulgarian names. According to estimates reported by the Federal Research Division of the US Library of Congress, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were sent to labor camps or were forcibly resettled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/bu/bulgariacountrys00curt_0/bulgariacountrys00curt_0.pdf|title=Bulgaria: A country study|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|year=1993|editor-first=Glenn E.|editor-last=Curtis|page=82|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe fall of communism in Bulgaria led to a reversal of the state's policy towards its citizens of Turkish descent.

Ravenstein.]]\n[[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|The conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans]] set in motion important population movements, which modified the ethnic and religious composition of the conquered territories. This demographic restructuring was accomplished through colonization of strategic areas of the Balkans with Turks brought or exiled from [[Anatolia]], establishing a firm Turkish [[Muslim]] base for further conquests in [[Europe]]. [[The Ottomans|Ottoman Empire]] used colonization as a very effective method to consolidate their position and power in the Balkans. The colonizers that were brought to the [[Balkans]] consisted of diverse elements, including groups uneasy for the state, soldiers, nomads, farmers, artisans and merchants, [[dervishes]], preachers and other religious functionaries, and administrative personnel. Among the earliest arrivals were large numbers of pastoral peoples such as the [[Y\u00fcr\u00fcks]], [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]] ([[Oghuz Turks]]), [[Tatars]] from Anatolia and [[Crimean Tatars]] ([[Qarai Turks|Qaraei or Kara Tatar]]s) led by their chieftain [[Aktav]].<ref name=\"unm.edu\">Hooper, Paul Lovell: Forced Population Transfers in Early Ottoman Imperial Strategy, Princeton University, May 2003 [http://www.unm.edu/~phooper/thesis_condensed.pdf]</ref> As the [[Ottomans]] expanded their conquests in the Balkans, they brought nomads from [[Anatolia]] and settled them along the main highways and in the surrounding mountain regions. Densely populated Turkish colonies were established in the frontier regions of [[Thrace]], the [[Maritsa]] and the [[Tundzha]] valleys. The colonization policies already begun under Orhan were continued by his successors [[Murat I]] (1360\u201384) and [[Bayezit I]] (1389\u20131402). Additional colonists, mostly nomads again, were established along key transportation and communication routes in Thrace, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Thessaly]]. The Ottoman authorities maintained these nomads in their tribal organization through the 16th century and began to settle them only during the 17th century.\n\nIn addition to voluntary migrations, the Ottoman authorities used mass deportations (''s\u00fcrg\u00fcn'') as a method of control over potentially rebellious elements in the Balkans and in [[Anatolia]]. Far away from their home bases, the potential threat of such elements was considerably reduced as in the case of the followers of the rebellious Karamani [[Pir Ahmed]]. Tribal resistance was followed by large-scale transfers of [[Karamanids|Karamanid]] and [[Oghuz Turks|T\u00fcrkmen]] nomads to [[Deliorman]] and [[Rumelia]]. Deportations in both directions occurred throughout the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.<ref name=\"unm.edu\"/>\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Bayezid I]] at the [[battle of Ankara]] by the forces of [[Tamerlane]] in 1402, the Ottomans abandoned their [[Anatolia]]n domains for a while and considered the Balkans their real home, making [[Adrianople]] ([[Edirne]]) their new capital. The Timurid invasions and other upheavals in [[Anatolia]] brought additional Turkish settlers into the Balkans. Numerous Turkish colonists were settled as farmers in new villages. ''[[Vak\u0131f]]'' deeds and reg\u0131sters of the 15th century show that there was a wide movement of colonization, with western Anatolian peasantry settling in [[Thrace]] and the eastern Balkans and founding hundreds of new villages. Some other settlers came in search of military and administrative service, and still others to establish Islamic religious institutions. Muslims were settled densely along the two great historical routes of the [[Balkan Peninsula|Peninsula]], one going through Thrace and Macedonia to the [[Adriatic]] and the other passing through the [[Maritsa]] and [[Tundzha]] valleys to the [[Danube]]. The [[Y\u00fcr\u00fcks]] were settled mostly in the mountainous parts of the area. A census conducted between 1520 and 1530 showed that 19% of the Balkan population was [[Muslim]].<ref>Ira Marvin Lapidus: \"A history of Islamic societies\" 2002 pp.252</ref>\n\nThe greatest impact of Ottoman colonization in the Balkans, however, was felt in the urban centers. Many towns became major centers for [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] control and administration, with most Christians gradually withdrawing to the mountains. Historical evidence shows that the Ottomans embarked on a systematic policy of creating new towns and repopulating older towns that had suffered significant population decline and economic dislocation during the two centuries of incessant wars preceding the Ottoman conquest, as well as the ravages of the Ottoman conquest itself. Often re-colonization of old towns and the establishment of new towns were accompanied by bodily transplanting settlers from other areas of the [[Ottoman Empire|Empire]] or with Muslim refugees from other lands.<ref>Eminov 1997</ref>\nRecords show that by the end of the 14th century, Muslim Turks formed the absolute majority in large urban towns in Upper Thrace such as [[Plovdiv]] (Filibe) and [[Pazardzhik]] (Tatar Pazarcik).<ref>{{citation |author=Grigor Boykov |title=Demographic features of Ottoman Upper Thrace: A case study on Filibe, Tatar Pazarc\u0131k and \u0130stanimaka (1472\u20131614) |publisher=Department of History, Bilkent University, Ankara |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0002749.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman Architecture in Bulgaria===\n[[File:Banya-bashi-imagesfrombulgaria.JPG|thumb|left|100px|[[Banya Bashi Mosque]] in [[Sofia]]]]\n[[File:Tombul Djamia Shumen.JPG|right|thumb|150px|[[Tombul Mosque]] in [[Shumen]]]]\n[[File:Filibe cami.JPG|right|thumb|150px|[[Plovdiv Cuma Mosque]] in [[Plovdiv]]]]\n[[File:Straat in Oud Plovdiv 1.jpeg|right|thumb|150px|Old [[Plovdiv]]]]\n[[Ottoman architecture]] has shaped and left visible marks on the [[Balkan]] urban landscape. Two distinct crafts are evident in Ottoman urban culture that of the architect and that of the master builder (''maistores'' in Macedonia and Epirus, ''kalfa'' in Anatolia and sometimes\nin Bulgaria) who shared the responsibilities and tasks for the design and construction of all sorts of building projects. During [[Mimar Sinan]]'s period as a chief imperial architect until the second half of the 16th century between forty and seventy architects produced designs for a very large labour force, controlled the construction of military and civil facilities, water and road infrastructure from [[Budapest]] to [[Cairo]]. The centralized ''has'' or ''hassa'' (sultan's property and service) system had allowed a small number of architects to control all significant imperial and most vakif building sites over the vast territories of the empire. In the 18th century the empire was opened to Western influence. By the late 18th century a growing number of Ottoman Christians were recruited. Until the very end of the Ottoman state the master builders maintained a cultural equilibrium between the Ottoman spirit and architectural innovation both in the Balkans and Anatolia. Turkish, Slavic, and Greek masters combining Western styles with Ottoman views extended the architectural landscape with one of the best examples being the [[Filibe]]-[[Plovdiv]] symmetrical house. Innovations were derived from the Ottoman house and market (''\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131'') buildings in Anatolia, Macedonia, and Bulgaria.<ref>Cerasi, Maurice: \"Late Ottoman architects and master builders\"</ref>\n\n===From Liberation to Communist Rule (1878 to 1946)===\n[[File:Bulgaria Census Chart 1880 1910.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Population of Bulgaria between 1880 and 1910]]\n\nThe estimates of the number of Turks in the current Bulgarian territories prior to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish war of 1878]] vary.

Under the new ''(\"foreign\")'' Bulgarian administration the Turkish intellectuals felt the need to communicate the new laws and regulations to the Turkish population by first providing translations of the Bulgarian State Gazette. During the years the number of Turkish newspapers and publications published in the Principality of Bulgaria rose to 90.\n\nThe Turkish Press in Bulgaria was faced with many difficulties and a significant amount of newspapers operated on the verge of being banned and their journalists being expelled from the country. Turkish journalists and teachers organised by establishing the Islamic Teachers Community in Bulgaria ''(Bulgaristan Muallimi Isl\u00e2miye Cemiyeti)'' and the Union of Turan Communities in Bulgaria ''(Turan Cemiyetleri Birli\u011fi)'' which was a youth organisation. The leaders of these organisations met during National Congresses held each year in different locations in Bulgaria. The largest National Congress was held in Sofia in 1929 with over 1000 participants.\n\nBetween 1895 and 1945 there were several well known Turkish newspapers in Bulgaria:\n\n'''Gayret''':\nThe newspaper was founded in [[Plovdiv]] in 1895 and printed by Filibeli R\u0131za Pa\u015fa.\nIn 1896 the famous Turkish thinker and intellectual \u00dcbeydullah Efendi wrote columns in Gayret and in a later stage became the newspaper's head columnist.\n\n'''Muvazene''':\nThe weekly newspaper was first published in 20 August 1897 in [[Plovdiv]] by the graduates of the ''Mektebi M\u00fclkiye Ulumu Siyasie'' and printed by Filibeli R\u0131za Pa\u015fa. The newspaper's operations temporarily moved to [[Varna]] before returning to back to [[Plovdiv]]. One of the most known writers in Muvazene was Ali Fefhmi Bey who promoted the unionisation of the Turkish teachers in Bulgaria and was the instigator of the first Turkish teacher's congress in [[Shumen]]. During the congress the Islamic Teachers Community in Bulgaria ''(Bulgaristan Muallimi Isl\u00e2miye Cemiyeti)'' was founded.\n\n'''Rumeli \u2013 Balkan''':\nFounded in 1904 by Etem Ruhi Balkan. After the first three editions the newspaper's name was changed to Balkan. Daily editions were published until the eruption of the Balkan Wars in 1912. The newspaper was also printed by Maullimi Mehmet Mahri and Halil Zeki Bey. Since Etem Ruhi was often imprisoned the management of the newspaper shifted to H\u00fcsn\u00fc Mahmut in 1912 and 1917 Halil Ibrahim became the head editor. The newspaper ended its publications in 1920.\n\n'''UHUVVET''':\nFounded by unknown group of journalists in 24 May 1904 the weekly newspaper was printed in [[Rousse]] and focused on politics and daily events. In 1905 Mehmet Tefti\u015f became the manager of the newspaper.\n\n'''Tuna''':\nFounded in 1 September 1905 by Mehmet Tefti\u015f, Tuna was a daily newspaper printed in [[Rousse]]. After 415 editions the newspaper ended its operations, however on 13 October 1908 the publications of Tuna resumed after a group of intellectual Turks established a separate company designated to meet the needs for a Turkish daily newspaper in the region. The main contributors in the new Tuna newspaper were Tahir L\u00fctfi Bey, Haf\u0131z Abdullah Me\u00e7ik and Kizanlikli Ali Haydar.\n\n'''Terbiye Oca\u011f\u0131''':\nEstablished in 1921 by the Islamic Teachers Community in Bulgaria ''(Bulgaristan Muallimi Isl\u00e2miye Cemiyeti'') and printed in Varna between 1923 and 1925. Known contributors in Terbiye Oca\u011f\u0131 were Osman Nuri Peremeci, Haf\u0131z Abdullah Me\u00e7ik, Hasip Ahmet Aytuna, Mustafa \u015eerif Alyanak, Mehmet Mahsum, Osmanpazarli Ibrahim Hakki O\u011fuz, Ali Avni, Ebu\u015finasi Hasan Sabri, H\u00fcseyin Edip and Tayyarzade Cemil Bey.\n\n'''Yolda\u015f''':\nFounded in 1921 by Haf\u0131z Abdullah Me\u00e7ik and published every second week in [[Shumen]]. Yolda\u015f was one of the first Turkish children's publications in Bulgaria.\n\n'''DEL\u0130ORMAN''':\nOwned by Mahmut Necmettin Deliorman the newspaper started its publications in 21 October 1922 in Razgrad with Ahmet Ihsan as its head editor. Between 1923 and 1925 Mustafa \u015eerif Alyanak took on the job of head editor with weekly editions. Deliorman also functioned as the main publication for the Turkish Union of Sport's Clubs in Bulgaria. Turkish columnists such as Hasip Saffeti, Ahmet Aytuna, Hafiz Ismail Hakki, Yahya Hayati, H\u00fcsmen Celal, \u00c7etin Ebu\u015finasi and Hasan Sabri were household names in Deliorman.\n\n'''Turan''':\nFounded on 6 May 1928 in [[Vidin]], Turan was a channel for the Union of Turkish Youth Communities in Bulgaria. The newspaper was also printed in [[Kardzhali]] and Varna until it was closed in 1934.\n\n'''Tebligat''':\nFounded in 1929 and published by the office of the Grand Mufti and Islamic Foundations in Sofia.\n\n'''Rodop''':\nFounded in April 1929 in [[Kardzhali]] by L\u00fctfi Takano\u011flu. Rodop focused on the rights, freedoms and national matters of the Turkish population in Bulgaria. Most known writers in Rodop were Mustafa \u015eerif Alyanak and \u00d6mer Ka\u015fif Nalbando\u011flu. As many other Turkish newspapers in Bulgaria Rodop was forced to stop its operations during 1934 and its writers were either expelled or forced to seek refuge in Turkey.\n\nProfessor [[Ali Eminov]] from Wayne State College has compiled an extensive list:<ref>{{cite web|author=Ali Eminov |url=http://academic.wsc.edu/faculty/alemino1/biblios-select_works_by_native_turks.html |title=Select Works by Native Turks in Bulgaria |publisher=Academic.wsc.edu |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://academic.wsc.edu/faculty/alemino1/biblios-select_works_by_native_turks.html|title=Select Works by Native Turks in Bulgaria|work=wsc.edu|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith the right-wing coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934, Turkish-language press was suppressed. Only in the course of the first year, ten of the newspapers were closed down (including ''Deliorman'' and ''Turan''), and by 1939, a single newspaper ''Havadis'' (\"The News\") survived, only to be closed down in turn in 1941. The explanation cited was that the newspapers were disseminating Kemalist (i.e. Turkish nationalist) propaganda.<ref name=\"bghelsinki.org\">[http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508224135/http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc|date=8 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Transfer of Land====\nThe transfer of land from [[Turkish people|Turkish]] to [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] ownership which was the most important effect of Turkish emigration was a complex process. Such transfers had taken place before 1878, for example parts in the [[Pazardzhik|Tatar Pazardzhik]] district, where Bulgarian landowners had been unknown in 1840 {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, some two thousand plots had been bought by them between 1872 and 1875. In 1877 and in the following years the process of transfer took place on an immensely greater scale, both here and elsewhere.<ref>Crampton 1983, pp.178</ref> In 1875 some 50% of the land in [[Rumelia]] was owned by Turks.<ref>Crampton, R. J, \"Bulgaria\" Oxford University Press, 2007, pp.288</ref> A decade after 1878 as much as a quarter of the arable land in Bulgaria transferred from Turkish to Bulgarian ownership.<ref>Crampton, R. J., \"A Short History of Modern Bulgaria\" Cambridge University Press, 1987, pp.71</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78|war]] some [[Turkish people|Turks]] sold their property, mostly to wealthy local Bulgarians. Other Turks rented their lands, usually to dependable local Bulgarians, on the understanding that it would be handed back if and when the owners returned. Most departing Turks, however, simply abandoned their land and fled, the fall of [[Pleven]] had made it clear that the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] were to win the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|War]]. As the Turks fled many Bulgarians seized some of the land now made vacant.<ref>Stephen K. Wegren: \"Land reform in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe\" 1998 pp.209</ref> The incidence of seizure varied regionally. In the north-east the Turks were numerous and, feeling safety in numbers, few of them had left and those remaining were therefore strong enough to discourage seizures by Bulgarians. In the north and south-west on the other hand almost all Turks had fled and their lands were immediately taken over by local Bulgarians who often divided up the large estates found in these areas. In the remainder of northern Bulgaria transfers, often under the cloak of renting, took place in approximately one third of the communities. In the [[Veliko Tarnovo Province|Turnovo]] province, for example, there were seventy-seven Turkish mixed Turkish-Bulgarian villages of which twenty-four (31.0%) were seized by Bulgarians, twenty two (28.5%) were later repossessed by returning Turkish refugees, and another twenty-two remained unaffected; the fate of the remaining nine is unknown. In the south-west there was much more tension and violence. Here there was no provisions about renting and there were cases of Bulgarian peasants not only seizing land but also destroying buildings.<ref>Crampton 1983, pp.179</ref>\n\nIn the vast majority of cases it was local Bulgarians who seized the vacant land but Bulgarians from other parts of Bulgaria where there had been little Turkish emigration and Bulgarian refugees from Ottoman repressions in Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]] also took part in the seizures. In later months the publication of the terms of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] naturally intensified the flow of refugees from these areas and according to the prefect of [[Burgas]] province as helping themselves to \u00e9migr\u00e9 land \"in a most arbitrary fashion\" {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\nIn [[Burgas]] and the rest of [[Eastern Rumelia]] the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] intensified the land struggle by making Bulgarians more determined to seize sufficient land before Ottoman sovereignty was restored. It also encouraged the former Turkish owners to return. With these problems the Russian Provisional Administration had to contend.\n\nThe Provisional Administration did not have the power, even if it had had the will, to prevent so popular a movement as the seizure of vacant Turkish land, but nor could the Administration allow this movement to go completely unchecked for this would give the Turks and the British the excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of the liberated territories. Given these dangers the Russians handled the agrarian problem with considerable skill. In the summer of 1877 Bulgarian refugees from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]] and Ottoman [[Rumelia]] had been allowed to harvest the crops left by Turkish \u00e9migr\u00e9s and in September all Bulgarians, the incoming refugees and the indigenous, were allowed to sow vacant Turkish land, though it was insisted that this did not in any way signify a transfer of ownership. With the mass exodus of Turks after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] the Provisional Administration had little choice but to allow the [[Bulgarians]] to work the vacant land with rent, set at half the value of the harvest, to be paid to the legal owner. In many cases the Bulgarians simply refused to pay this rent and the Russians were not over-zealous in collecting it.\n\nWhen the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] guaranteed Turkish property rights and restored southern Bulgaria to the [[Sultan|Sultan's]] sovereignty at least 80,000 of the 150,000 Turkish \u00e9migr\u00e9s had returned by September 1878. This caused enormous problems including housing the returning Turks whose property had been taken over by Bulgarians or destroyed. In September local authorities ordered that any houses taken over by Bulgarians were to be restored to their former owners on the latter's demand, whilst other returning [[Turkish people|Turks]] were given [[Tatar]] or [[Circassians|Circassian]] land.\n\nThese problems were insignificant compared to those raised when the returning Turks demanded the restitution of their lost lands.\n\nIn July 1878 the Russian Provisional Administration had come to an agreement with the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] by which Turkish refugees were allowed to return under military escort, if necessary, and were to have their lands back on condition that they surrendered all their weapons. In August 1878 it was decreed that those returning would not be immune from prosecution and anyone against whom any charges were substantiated would be deprived of his lands. This decree, more than anything else, discouraged the return of more Turks and from the date of this enactment the flow of returning refugees began gradually to diminish. There were, however, many claims still to be dealt with and in November 1878 mixed Turkish and Bulgarian commissions were established in all provinces to examine these claims. The decisions were to be made in accordance with rules drawn up by the Russian embassy in [[Constantinople]] in consultation with the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], and under them Bulgarians could secure the legal right to a piece of land if they could produce the authentic title-deeds, tapii, and thereby prove that the land at dispute had originally been taken from them forcibly or fraudulently.\n\nAfter the departure of the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] in the spring of 1879 the administration in Plovdiv ordered to enforce court decisions returning land to the Turks. Only half of the courts had recorded such decisions. Other actions were even less emotive and in 1880 the position of the Bulgarians in [[Eastern Rumelia]] had improved. The [[Plovdiv]] government introduced new methods for authenticating claims, allowing local courts to issue new title deeds if they were satisfied that existing documentation proved ownership, or if local communal councils had issued certificates attesting ownership. Most local councils were entirely Bulgarian or were dominated by [[Bulgarians]] and decided in favour of their co-nationals far more often than did the mixed commissions with whom the prerogative of adjunction had previously rested. In many instances, too, [[Bulgarians]] refused to relinquish land they had seized and as late as 1884 there were still Turkish landlords demanding the implementation of court orders restoring their property.\n\nThe [[Bulgarians]] in [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] were also helped from 1880 onwards because the [[Turkish People|Turks]] began to drift once more into exile. This was very much the result of disappointed hopes for a full restoration of Turkish power south of the Balkan range. By 1880 the [[Bulgarians]] had gained complete control of the province and to this many Turks, and particularly the richer and previously more influential ones, could not adapt. The Turks had never allowed the [[Bulgarians]] social or legal equality. Now they were forced to concede their superiority and for many Turks this was too much to bear and they gratefully accepted offers of land from the Sultan and returned to the more familiar atmosphere of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThe [[Turkish People|Turks]] were also encouraged to emigrate from [[Bulgaria]] by regulations which affected the cultivation of rice \u2013 which was originally introduced to the region by the Turks. This was part of a project to eradicate malaria that included also draining of swamps in the Tundzha, Arda, and Maritsa Basins. The project succeeded in eradicating malaria, however, it also exacerbated droughts in those regions. Rice was a staple crop for the Turks and in its prohibition many of them saw yet another sign of unacceptable Bulgarian domination. An even more important impulse to Turkish emigration was the Bulgarian land tax of 1882. By [[Moslem]] law all land was owned by [[God]] but after the abolition of feudalism in the 1830s use of that land conferred temporary wardship upon the user, and thus the tithe which had been the main levy on land until 1882 conformed to traditional Moslem codes of thought and practice. The land tax did not. Furthermore, land tax applied to all land in a man's possession not, as under the tithe, merely to that part which had been cultivated. This hit the Turks hard for they customarily left a large proportion, in many cases as much as half, of their land fallow. Taxation now fell on the fallow land too but production and earnings could not be increased by the same proportion and as a result many of the remaining Turkish owners of large estates left Rumelia. Significantly 1882 was the peak year for the sale of larger Turkish properties in Rumelia, though the sale of such properties continued steadily throughout the first half of the 1880s. From the end of the war to the summer of 1880 only six large Turkish chifliks in [[Eastern Rumelia]] had been sold but the five years before union with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885 saw the sale of about a hundred. That most of the larger Turkish owners and many smaller ones left [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] was undoubtedly an important factor in the easy attainment of Bulgarian supremacy in [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] during the early 1880s.\n\nIn [[Principality of Bulgaria]] as in [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] the chaos of war had allowed a number of seizures to go unrecorded meaning that the new occupiers were to be left in untroubled possession of their land. The Constituent Assembly had considered a proposal to legislate such illegal transfers but no action had been taken as [[Lyuben Karavelov|Karavelov]] had easily persuaded the Assembly that it was pointless to legislate about so widespread a phenomenon. The [[Bulgarians]] in the [[Principality of Bulgaria|Principality]] could afford such bold stance as there was little danger of direct Ottoman intervention over the land question. There was a constant stream of emigration by Turks from Bulgaria and by the early 1890s so many Turks had left the former Turkish stronghold of north-eastern Bulgaria that the government in [[Sofia]] began to fear that the area would be seriously under-populated. In 1891 the Minister of Finance reported to the Subranie that there were 26,315 vacant plots in the country, many of them in the north-east and most of them under twenty dekars in extent.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the government also took possession of Turkish land which had been vacant for three years. A number of returning Turkish refugees who demanded restitution of or compensation for their lands were denied both on the grounds that they had without duress left their property unworked for three years.<ref>Crampton 1983, pp.183</ref> Land rights of Muslim owners were largely disregarded despite of being guaranteed by the powers.

The official Turkish language became the language of a minority. In 1875 there were 2,700 Turkish primary schools, 40 secondary schools and 150 ''medreses'' in the [[Danube Vilayet]]. By 1913 the number of Turkish schools was reduced to 1,234 all of which had to be financed by the Turkish community.\n\nFollowing the First World War the Bulgarian government provided financial assistance to the Turkish schools and their number grew to 1,712 with 60,481 pupils. As the fascist regime gained power in 1934, Turkish school, which had adopted the Latin alphabet following the reforms in Turkey, were forced to teach in the Arabic script. This was in order to reduce the nationalistic influences coming from Turkey.\n\nAs the Communists took control in Bulgaria in 1944 they delivered on their promises for more liberties for the ethnic minorities. Turkish schools were reopened and the usage of the Latin script allowed. The new regime however nationalised the schools and took them under state control. In 1944 there were 84,603 Turkish children in school age, 40,388 of whom did not attend school. According to the law, graduates from Turkish schools were considered as illiterate.\n\nIn 1956 the number of Turkish schools is put at 1,149 with 100,843 pupils and 4,527 teachers. After 1958 the Turkish language in these schools was replaced with Bulgarian as the official language and Turkish became an elected subject. After 1970 teaching Turkish in schools was abolished and by 1984 the use of the Turkish language itself was deemed illegal. The only two remaining bi-lingual journals ''Yeni I\u015f\u0131k'' and ''Yeni Hayat'' were printed in Bulgarian only.<ref>Suleiman, Yasir, . \"Language and identity in the Middle East and North Africa \", Cornwall, Great Britain 1996, pp.104\u2013105</ref>\n\n===During Communist rule (1945 to 1989)===\n\n==== Initial improvements (1944\u20131956) ====\nAfter the Communist takeover in 1944, the new regime declared itself in favour of all minorities and inter-ethnic equality and fraternity (in accordance with the classic doctrine of [[proletarian internationalism]]) and annulled all the \"[[fascist]]\" anti-Muslim decisions of the previous government.<ref name=helsinki35>[http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee: The Human Rights of Muslims in Bulgaria in Law and Politics since 1878] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007234907/http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc |date=7 October 2006 }} (p.35)</ref> This included banning the \"Rodina\" organization,<ref name=helsinki35/> re-establishing the closed Turkish minority schools and founding new ones.

By 1984 other Muslims, mostly the [[Muslim Roma]] and the [[Pomaks]] had already been forced to give up their [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Muslim]] names for [[Christian name]]s. The government had been encouraging the educated Turks to voluntarily adopt Bulgarian names.\n\nThe exact reasons for Zhivkov's mass-scale assimilation programme are unclear, but it is believed that one of the main factors was the projection that by 1990 the Bulgarian population would experience a zero or negative population growth resulting in increasing Muslim population and declining Bulgarian population.<ref>Eminov, Ali: Turkish and Other Muslim Minorities of Bulgaria, 1997, pp.92</ref>\n\nIn June 1984, the Politburo voted a policy named \"For the further unification and inclusion of Turks into the cause of socialism and the policies of the Bulgarian Communist Party\".

Bulgarians came to be seen as occupiers and oppressors and protest demonstrations took place in some of the bigger villages in the southern and northern Turk enclaves.

On 29 December, the government allowed the Turks of Bulgaria to resume use of their Turkish names. This decision was recognized by law in March 1990. By 1991, some 600&nbsp;thousand applications were received for the reinstatement of Turkish birth given names. Also in 1991, the Institutition of the Spiritual leader of the Muslims in Bulgaria, the Grand Mufti's Office was founded. In 1991 a new Constitution was adopted granting citizens of non-Bulgarian origin a wide range of rights and lifting the legislative ban on teaching in Turkish. In January of the same year another law was adopted allowing the Turks to change their names or \"strike out\" their Slavonic endings like \"ov\", \"ova\", \"ev\", \"eva\" within three years.<ref name=\"noravank1\">[http://www.noravank.am/file/article/257_en.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229172208/http://www.noravank.am/file/article/257_en.pdf|date=29 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAs in other parts of [[Eastern Europe]], the repeal of single-party rule in Bulgaria exposed the long-standing grievances of an ethnic minority. The urban intelligentsia that participated in the 1990 reform movement pushed the post-[[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] governments toward restoring constitutionally guaranteed human rights to the Turks. But abrogation of Zhivkov's assimilation program soon after his fall brought massive protests by ethnic Bulgarians.\n\nIn January 1990, the Social Council of Citizens, a national body representing all political and ethnic groups, reached a compromise that guaranteed the Turks freedom of religion, choice of names, and unimpeded practice of cultural traditions and use of Turkish within the community. In turn the Bulgarians were promised that Bulgarian would remain the official language and that no movement for autonomy or separatism would be tolerated. Especially in areas where Turks outnumbered Bulgarians, the latter feared progressive \"Islamification\" or even invasion and annexation by Turkey\u2014a fear that was based on the traditional enmity after the Ottoman rule and had been stirred up after the 1974 invasion of Cyprus. This had been part of the propaganda during by the Zhivkov assimilation campaign and was revived by politicians in post-Communist Bulgaria. Because radical elements of the Turkish population did advocate separatism, however, the non-annexation provision of the compromise was vital.\n\nThe Bulgarian governments that followed Zhivkov tried to realize the conditions of the compromise as quickly as possible. In the multiparty election of 1990, the Turks won representation in the National Assembly by twenty-three candidates of the predominantly Turkish [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] (MRF). At that point, ethnic Bulgarians, many remaining from the Zhivkov regime, still held nearly all top jobs in government and industry, even in the predominantly Turkish Kurdzhali Province. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Parts of Bulgarian society felt threatened by the rise of the MRF. The Bulgarian National Radical Party (BNRP) threatened to surround the Bulgarian Parliament building on the day of the newly elected legislature was scheduled to convene. The BNRP protested the participation of ethnic Turks in the National Assembly and the teaching of Turkish language as a standard curriculum in secondary school with large numbers of Turkish students.<ref>Janusz Bugajski: \"Political parties of Eastern Europe: a guide to politics in the post\" 2002 pp.804</ref>\n\nThe [[Patriotic Party of Labour]] (OPT) was established as the political wing of the National Committee for Defense of National Interests (CDNI). According to its own historiography the OPT emerged due to pressure from ordinary Bulgarian citizens who were outraged by the fact that the MRF was allowed to participate in the 1990 elections. CDNI members were mainly small-shop owners, artisans, farmers and elements of the local [[communist]] nomenklatura. The CDNI did not limit itself to rhetoric but also arranged protests against ethnic Turks returning to Bulgaria to claim back their names and property. In October 1991 violent outbreaks occurred between Bulgarian nationalists and Turkish activists in [[Razgrad]].<ref name=\"Janusz Bugajski pp.805-807\">Janusz Bugajski: \"Political parties of Eastern Europe: a guide to politics in the post\" 2002 pp.805\u2013807</ref>\n\nBulgarian nationalist forces tried to take advantage of the country's hard economic and uncertain political conditions. In November 1990 massive protests were staged by Bulgarian nationalists in [[Razgrad]] area inhabited by a large number of Turks. The nationalists declared an \"independent Bulgarian republic\" and refused to recognize Sofia's authority over the region.

In 1991 the most important issue of the controversy was restoring Turkish language teaching in the schools of Turkish ethnic districts. In 1991 the Popov government took initial steps in this direction, but long delays brought massive Turkish protests, especially in Kurdzhali. In mid-1991 continuing strikes and protests on both sides of the issue had brought no new discussions of compromise.

The leader of the movement, [[Ahmed Dogan]], was imprisoned in 1986. Founded in 1990 to represent the interests of the Turkish ethnic minority, the MRF gained twenty three seats in the first parliamentary election that year, giving it the fourth-largest parliamentary voting bloc. Its agenda precluded mass media coverage or building coalitions with other parties, because of the strong anti-Turkish element in Bulgaria's political culture. By mid-1991, the UDF had held only one joint demonstration with the MRF; their failure to reconcile differences was considered a major weakness in the opposition to the majority BSP. In early 1990, the MRF protested vigorously but unsuccessfully its exclusion from national round table discussions among the major Bulgarian parties.\n\nIn 1991 the MRF broadened its platform to embrace all issues of civil rights in Bulgaria, aiming \"to contribute to the unity of the Bulgarian people and to the full and unequivocal compliance with the rights and freedoms of mankind and of all ethnic, religious, and cultural communities in Bulgaria.\" The MRF took this step partly to avoid the constitutional prohibition of political parties based on ethnic or religious groups. The group's specific goals were ensuring that the new constitution protect ethnic minorities adequately; introducing Turkish as an optional school subject; and bringing to trial the leaders of the assimilation campaign in the 1980s. To calm Bulgarian concerns, the MRF categorically renounced Islamic fundamentalism, terrorism, and ambitions for autonomy within Bulgaria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/55.htm |title=Bulgaria \u2013 The Public And Political Decision Making |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BG Parliamentary 2013 pie EN.png|250px|right|thumb|2013 Parliamentary election, distribution of votes by constituency (Movement for Rights and Freedoms in purple)]]\n[[File:BG Parliamentary 2013 grid.png|250px|right|thumb|Distribution of seats by constituency from the election]]\n\nIn the first general [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|elections in 1990]] after the communist regime which the Muslims boycotted, the party won 6.0% of the popular vote and 24 out of 400 seats and became the fourth largest party in the parliament. In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|parliamentary elections in 1991]] it won 7.6% of the vote and remained with 24 seats in \u0430 240-seat parliament. In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1994|elections in 1994]] it won 5.4% of the vote and its seats decreased to 15.

It won in the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2001|elections in 2001]] 7.5% of the vote and 21 out of 240 seats. Subsequently, for the first time the party joined a coalition government, which was led by the winner of the elections ([[NDSV]]). Under the control of the party were 2 out of 17 [[Government of Bulgaria|Bulgarian ministries]] \u2013 the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Food (Bulgaria)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forests]] and the [[Minister without portfolio]], the rest 15 remained under the control of [[NDSV]].\n\nAt the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 elections]] it increased to 12.8% of vote and 34 out of 240 seats and kept in power as a part of the coalition led by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|BSP]] and [[NDSV]] party. The ministries under the control of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms increased to 3 out of 18. In the budget of 2008, MRF directed a large parts of the subsidies for agriculture to tobacco growers (which are predominantly Turks, Pomaks, and Romani) leaving staple crops, like wheat, without subsidies for buying the seed for sowing. This evoked protests by farmers in the regions of Vratsa, Knezha, and Dobrudzha.\n\nAt the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 elections]] it increased to 14.0% of vote and 37 out of 240 seats. Following the election, the government was totally occupied by the decisive winner, the [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]] party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms returned to opposition after being part of coalition governments two consecutive terms between 2001 and 2009. At the [[2009 European Parliament election in Bulgaria|2009 European Parliament elections]] the party won 14.1% of the vote and 3 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] out of 18. Two of the MEPs are ethnic Turks ([[Filiz Husmenova]] and [[Metin Kazak]]) and one ([[Vladko Panayotov]]) is [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]].\n\nAccording to exit polls of the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|Bulgarian parliamentary election in 2013]], the Movement for Rights and Freedoms gained 11.3% of the vote, it keeps 36 seats and remains the third largest voting bloc. The party won the elections in five regions where the Muslim population resides \u2013  Kardzhali, Razgrad, Silistra, Targovishte and Shumen provinces; the party also wins abroad with 49% of the vote, in general the most polling stations and voters in a foreign country wherever were in Turkey, from where the party included 50,000 votes more to its result of 350,000 votes. Another Turkish party, founded in 2011 and headed by [[Korman Ismailov]] \u2013 [[People's Party Freedom and Dignity]] (PPFD) in a coalition with [[NDSV]] won 1.531% of the vote and therefore did not cross the 4% threshold to enter the parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/pi2013/rezultati/index.html |title=\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 :: \u0418\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 2013 |publisher=Results.cik.bg |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> Another political party founded in 1998 and representing a smaller fraction of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria is the National Movement for Rights and Freedoms (NMRF), which do not participate in the parliamentary elections.

R<sub>ST</sub> is based on the number of repeat differences between [[allele]]s at each [[microsatellite]] [[locus (genetics)|locus]] and is proposed to be better for most typical sample sizes, when data consist of variation at microsatellite [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or of [[nucleotide sequence]] ([[haplotype]]) information, the method may be unreliable unless a large number of loci are used. A nonsignificant test suggests that F<sub>ST</sub> should be preferred or when there is high gene flow within populations, F<sub>ST</sub> calculations are based on allele identity, it is likely to perform better than counterparts based on allele size information, the method depends on mutation rate, sometimes can likely provide biased estimate, but R<sub>ST</sub> will not perform necessarily better. A Bulgarian and other population studies observed concluded that when there is not much differiation, both statistical means show similar results, otherwise R<sub>ST</sub> is often superior to the F<sub>ST</sub>.

Being the dominant group in the Ottoman Empire for the next five centuries, they played an important part in the economic and cultural life of the land. Waves of impoverished Turks settled fertile lands, while Bulgarian families left their strategic settlements and resettled in more remote places. According to the historian Halil Inalcik, the Ottomans ensured significant Turkish presence in forward urban outposts such as [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], [[Kyustendil]], [[Silistra]], [[Trikala]], [[Skopje]] and [[Vidin]] and their vicinity. Ottoman Muslims constituted the majority in and around strategic routes primarily in the southern Balkans leading from [[Thrace]] towards [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Adriatic]] and again from the [[Maritsa]] and [[Tundzha]] valleys towards the [[Danube]] region.<ref>Inalcik, Halil., \"Osmanlilar\", Istanbul 2010, p.85</ref> According to Aubaret, the French Consul in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] in 1876 in the [[Danube Vilayet]] (which then included the territory of the post-1878 Bulgarian principality and [[Northern Dobruja]]) alone there were 1,120,000 Muslims, of whom 774,000 (33%) were Turks and 1,233,500 non-Muslims of whom 1,150,000 were Bulgarian.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suleiman|first1=Yasir|title=Language and Identity in the Middle East and North Africa|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136787843|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugVeAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102|page=102|date=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=ENG\u0130N DEN\u0130Z TANIR|title=THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY OTTOMAN BULGARIA FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF THE FRENCH TRAVELERS A THESIS SUBMITTED TO THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES OF MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY BY|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/188315570/THE-MID-NINETEENTH-CENTURY-OTTOMAN-BULGARIA-FROM-THE-VIEWPOINTS-OF-THE-FRENCH-TRAVELERS-pdf|page=52}}</ref> The Ottoman officer [[Stanislas Saint Clair]] in 1876 based on Ottoman [[passport|teskere]] estimated roughly the same proportions and that Turkish males in the Danube Vilayet represent 36% of the male population.<ref>[http://spisaniestatistika.nsi.bg/page/bg/details.php?article_id=84&tab=en \u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432. \u0418\u0417\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0415\u041d\u0418\u042f \u0412 \u0411\u0420\u041e\u042f \u041d\u0410 \u041d\u0410\u0421\u0415\u041b\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415\u0422\u041e \u041f\u041e \u0411\u042a\u041b\u0413\u0410\u0420\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0422\u0415 \u0417\u0415\u041c\u0418 \u0412 \u0421\u042a\u0421\u0422\u0410\u0412\u0410 \u041d\u0410 \u041e\u0421\u041c\u0410\u041d\u0421\u041a\u0410\u0422\u0410 \u0418\u041c\u041f\u0415\u0420\u0418\u042f] National Statistical Institute</ref> Between 1876 and 1878, through emigration, massacres, epidemics and hunger a large portion of the Turkish population vanished.

During the 20th century Bulgaria also practiced forced deportations and expulsions, which also targeted the Muslim [[Pomak]] population.<ref>Suleiman, Yasir, . \"Language and identity in the Middle East and North Africa \", Cornwall, Great Britain 1996, pp.102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe biggest wave of Turkish emigration occurred in 1989, when 360,000 left Bulgaria as a result of the [[communist]] [[Todor Zhivkov]] regime's assimilation campaign, but around 150,000 returned between 1989 and 1990. That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt [[Christian name]]s and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign was unclear; however, many experts believed that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor.<ref name=autogenerated1>Glenn E.

During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would be issued only in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity removed. Mosques were closed or demolished. Turkish names on gravestones were replaced with Bulgarian names. According to estimates reported by the Federal Research Division of the US Library of Congress, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were sent to labor camps or were forcibly resettled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/bu/bulgariacountrys00curt_0/bulgariacountrys00curt_0.pdf|title=Bulgaria: A country study|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|year=1993|editor-first=Glenn E.|editor-last=Curtis|page=82|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe fall of communism in Bulgaria led to a reversal of the state's policy towards its citizens of Turkish descent.

In 1991 a new law gave anyone affected by the name-changing campaign three years to officially restore original names and the names of children born after the name change.

Ravenstein.]]\n[[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|The conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans]] set in motion important population movements, which modified the ethnic and religious composition of the conquered territories. This demographic restructuring was accomplished through colonization of strategic areas of the Balkans with Turks brought or exiled from [[Anatolia]], establishing a firm Turkish [[Muslim]] base for further conquests in [[Europe]]. [[The Ottomans|Ottoman Empire]] used colonization as a very effective method to consolidate their position and power in the Balkans. The colonizers that were brought to the [[Balkans]] consisted of diverse elements, including groups uneasy for the state, soldiers, nomads, farmers, artisans and merchants, [[dervishes]], preachers and other religious functionaries, and administrative personnel. Among the earliest arrivals were large numbers of pastoral peoples such as the [[Y\u00fcr\u00fcks]], [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]] ([[Oghuz Turks]]), [[Tatars]] from Anatolia and [[Crimean Tatars]] ([[Qarai Turks|Qaraei or Kara Tatar]]s) led by their chieftain [[Aktav]].<ref name=\"unm.edu\">Hooper, Paul Lovell: Forced Population Transfers in Early Ottoman Imperial Strategy, Princeton University, May 2003 [http://www.unm.edu/~phooper/thesis_condensed.pdf]</ref> As the [[Ottomans]] expanded their conquests in the Balkans, they brought nomads from [[Anatolia]] and settled them along the main highways and in the surrounding mountain regions. Densely populated Turkish colonies were established in the frontier regions of [[Thrace]], the [[Maritsa]] and the [[Tundzha]] valleys. The colonization policies already begun under Orhan were continued by his successors [[Murat I]] (1360\u201384) and [[Bayezit I]] (1389\u20131402). Additional colonists, mostly nomads again, were established along key transportation and communication routes in Thrace, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Thessaly]]. The Ottoman authorities maintained these nomads in their tribal organization through the 16th century and began to settle them only during the 17th century.\n\nIn addition to voluntary migrations, the Ottoman authorities used mass deportations (''s\u00fcrg\u00fcn'') as a method of control over potentially rebellious elements in the Balkans and in [[Anatolia]]. Far away from their home bases, the potential threat of such elements was considerably reduced as in the case of the followers of the rebellious Karamani [[Pir Ahmed]]. Tribal resistance was followed by large-scale transfers of [[Karamanids|Karamanid]] and [[Oghuz Turks|T\u00fcrkmen]] nomads to [[Deliorman]] and [[Rumelia]]. Deportations in both directions occurred throughout the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.<ref name=\"unm.edu\"/>\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Bayezid I]] at the [[battle of Ankara]] by the forces of [[Tamerlane]] in 1402, the Ottomans abandoned their [[Anatolia]]n domains for a while and considered the Balkans their real home, making [[Adrianople]] ([[Edirne]]) their new capital. The Timurid invasions and other upheavals in [[Anatolia]] brought additional Turkish settlers into the Balkans. Numerous Turkish colonists were settled as farmers in new villages. ''[[Vak\u0131f]]'' deeds and reg\u0131sters of the 15th century show that there was a wide movement of colonization, with western Anatolian peasantry settling in [[Thrace]] and the eastern Balkans and founding hundreds of new villages. Some other settlers came in search of military and administrative service, and still others to establish Islamic religious institutions. Muslims were settled densely along the two great historical routes of the [[Balkan Peninsula|Peninsula]], one going through Thrace and Macedonia to the [[Adriatic]] and the other passing through the [[Maritsa]] and [[Tundzha]] valleys to the [[Danube]]. The [[Y\u00fcr\u00fcks]] were settled mostly in the mountainous parts of the area. A census conducted between 1520 and 1530 showed that 19% of the Balkan population was [[Muslim]].<ref>Ira Marvin Lapidus: \"A history of Islamic societies\" 2002 pp.252</ref>\n\nThe greatest impact of Ottoman colonization in the Balkans, however, was felt in the urban centers. Many towns became major centers for [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] control and administration, with most Christians gradually withdrawing to the mountains. Historical evidence shows that the Ottomans embarked on a systematic policy of creating new towns and repopulating older towns that had suffered significant population decline and economic dislocation during the two centuries of incessant wars preceding the Ottoman conquest, as well as the ravages of the Ottoman conquest itself. Often re-colonization of old towns and the establishment of new towns were accompanied by bodily transplanting settlers from other areas of the [[Ottoman Empire|Empire]] or with Muslim refugees from other lands.<ref>Eminov 1997</ref>\nRecords show that by the end of the 14th century, Muslim Turks formed the absolute majority in large urban towns in Upper Thrace such as [[Plovdiv]] (Filibe) and [[Pazardzhik]] (Tatar Pazarcik).<ref>{{citation |author=Grigor Boykov |title=Demographic features of Ottoman Upper Thrace: A case study on Filibe, Tatar Pazarc\u0131k and \u0130stanimaka (1472\u20131614) |publisher=Department of History, Bilkent University, Ankara |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0002749.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman Architecture in Bulgaria===\n[[File:Banya-bashi-imagesfrombulgaria.JPG|thumb|left|100px|[[Banya Bashi Mosque]] in [[Sofia]]]]\n[[File:Tombul Djamia Shumen.JPG|right|thumb|150px|[[Tombul Mosque]] in [[Shumen]]]]\n[[File:Filibe cami.JPG|right|thumb|150px|[[Plovdiv Cuma Mosque]] in [[Plovdiv]]]]\n[[File:Straat in Oud Plovdiv 1.jpeg|right|thumb|150px|Old [[Plovdiv]]]]\n[[Ottoman architecture]] has shaped and left visible marks on the [[Balkan]] urban landscape. Two distinct crafts are evident in Ottoman urban culture that of the architect and that of the master builder (''maistores'' in Macedonia and Epirus, ''kalfa'' in Anatolia and sometimes\nin Bulgaria) who shared the responsibilities and tasks for the design and construction of all sorts of building projects. During [[Mimar Sinan]]'s period as a chief imperial architect until the second half of the 16th century between forty and seventy architects produced designs for a very large labour force, controlled the construction of military and civil facilities, water and road infrastructure from [[Budapest]] to [[Cairo]]. The centralized ''has'' or ''hassa'' (sultan's property and service) system had allowed a small number of architects to control all significant imperial and most vakif building sites over the vast territories of the empire. In the 18th century the empire was opened to Western influence. By the late 18th century a growing number of Ottoman Christians were recruited. Until the very end of the Ottoman state the master builders maintained a cultural equilibrium between the Ottoman spirit and architectural innovation both in the Balkans and Anatolia. Turkish, Slavic, and Greek masters combining Western styles with Ottoman views extended the architectural landscape with one of the best examples being the [[Filibe]]-[[Plovdiv]] symmetrical house.

Under the new ''(\"foreign\")'' Bulgarian administration the Turkish intellectuals felt the need to communicate the new laws and regulations to the Turkish population by first providing translations of the Bulgarian State Gazette. During the years the number of Turkish newspapers and publications published in the Principality of Bulgaria rose to 90.\n\nThe Turkish Press in Bulgaria was faced with many difficulties and a significant amount of newspapers operated on the verge of being banned and their journalists being expelled from the country. Turkish journalists and teachers organised by establishing the Islamic Teachers Community in Bulgaria ''(Bulgaristan Muallimi Isl\u00e2miye Cemiyeti)'' and the Union of Turan Communities in Bulgaria ''(Turan Cemiyetleri Birli\u011fi)'' which was a youth organisation. The leaders of these organisations met during National Congresses held each year in different locations in Bulgaria. The largest National Congress was held in Sofia in 1929 with over 1000 participants.\n\nBetween 1895 and 1945 there were several well known Turkish newspapers in Bulgaria:\n\n'''Gayret''':\nThe newspaper was founded in [[Plovdiv]] in 1895 and printed by Filibeli R\u0131za Pa\u015fa.\nIn 1896 the famous Turkish thinker and intellectual \u00dcbeydullah Efendi wrote columns in Gayret and in a later stage became the newspaper's head columnist.\n\n'''Muvazene''':\nThe weekly newspaper was first published in 20 August 1897 in [[Plovdiv]] by the graduates of the ''Mektebi M\u00fclkiye Ulumu Siyasie'' and printed by Filibeli R\u0131za Pa\u015fa. The newspaper's operations temporarily moved to [[Varna]] before returning to back to [[Plovdiv]]. One of the most known writers in Muvazene was Ali Fefhmi Bey who promoted the unionisation of the Turkish teachers in Bulgaria and was the instigator of the first Turkish teacher's congress in [[Shumen]]. During the congress the Islamic Teachers Community in Bulgaria ''(Bulgaristan Muallimi Isl\u00e2miye Cemiyeti)'' was founded.\n\n'''Rumeli \u2013 Balkan''':\nFounded in 1904 by Etem Ruhi Balkan. After the first three editions the newspaper's name was changed to Balkan. Daily editions were published until the eruption of the Balkan Wars in 1912. The newspaper was also printed by Maullimi Mehmet Mahri and Halil Zeki Bey. Since Etem Ruhi was often imprisoned the management of the newspaper shifted to H\u00fcsn\u00fc Mahmut in 1912 and 1917 Halil Ibrahim became the head editor. The newspaper ended its publications in 1920.\n\n'''UHUVVET''':\nFounded by unknown group of journalists in 24 May 1904 the weekly newspaper was printed in [[Rousse]] and focused on politics and daily events. In 1905 Mehmet Tefti\u015f became the manager of the newspaper.\n\n'''Tuna''':\nFounded in 1 September 1905 by Mehmet Tefti\u015f, Tuna was a daily newspaper printed in [[Rousse]]. After 415 editions the newspaper ended its operations, however on 13 October 1908 the publications of Tuna resumed after a group of intellectual Turks established a separate company designated to meet the needs for a Turkish daily newspaper in the region. The main contributors in the new Tuna newspaper were Tahir L\u00fctfi Bey, Haf\u0131z Abdullah Me\u00e7ik and Kizanlikli Ali Haydar.\n\n'''Terbiye Oca\u011f\u0131''':\nEstablished in 1921 by the Islamic Teachers Community in Bulgaria ''(Bulgaristan Muallimi Isl\u00e2miye Cemiyeti'') and printed in Varna between 1923 and 1925. Known contributors in Terbiye Oca\u011f\u0131 were Osman Nuri Peremeci, Haf\u0131z Abdullah Me\u00e7ik, Hasip Ahmet Aytuna, Mustafa \u015eerif Alyanak, Mehmet Mahsum, Osmanpazarli Ibrahim Hakki O\u011fuz, Ali Avni, Ebu\u015finasi Hasan Sabri, H\u00fcseyin Edip and Tayyarzade Cemil Bey.\n\n'''Yolda\u015f''':\nFounded in 1921 by Haf\u0131z Abdullah Me\u00e7ik and published every second week in [[Shumen]]. Yolda\u015f was one of the first Turkish children's publications in Bulgaria.\n\n'''DEL\u0130ORMAN''':\nOwned by Mahmut Necmettin Deliorman the newspaper started its publications in 21 October 1922 in Razgrad with Ahmet Ihsan as its head editor. Between 1923 and 1925 Mustafa \u015eerif Alyanak took on the job of head editor with weekly editions. Deliorman also functioned as the main publication for the Turkish Union of Sport's Clubs in Bulgaria. Turkish columnists such as Hasip Saffeti, Ahmet Aytuna, Hafiz Ismail Hakki, Yahya Hayati, H\u00fcsmen Celal, \u00c7etin Ebu\u015finasi and Hasan Sabri were household names in Deliorman.\n\n'''Turan''':\nFounded on 6 May 1928 in [[Vidin]], Turan was a channel for the Union of Turkish Youth Communities in Bulgaria. The newspaper was also printed in [[Kardzhali]] and Varna until it was closed in 1934.\n\n'''Tebligat''':\nFounded in 1929 and published by the office of the Grand Mufti and Islamic Foundations in Sofia.\n\n'''Rodop''':\nFounded in April 1929 in [[Kardzhali]] by L\u00fctfi Takano\u011flu. Rodop focused on the rights, freedoms and national matters of the Turkish population in Bulgaria. Most known writers in Rodop were Mustafa \u015eerif Alyanak and \u00d6mer Ka\u015fif Nalbando\u011flu. As many other Turkish newspapers in Bulgaria Rodop was forced to stop its operations during 1934 and its writers were either expelled or forced to seek refuge in Turkey.\n\nProfessor [[Ali Eminov]] from Wayne State College has compiled an extensive list:<ref>{{cite web|author=Ali Eminov |url=http://academic.wsc.edu/faculty/alemino1/biblios-select_works_by_native_turks.html |title=Select Works by Native Turks in Bulgaria |publisher=Academic.wsc.edu |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://academic.wsc.edu/faculty/alemino1/biblios-select_works_by_native_turks.html|title=Select Works by Native Turks in Bulgaria|work=wsc.edu|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith the right-wing coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934, Turkish-language press was suppressed. Only in the course of the first year, ten of the newspapers were closed down (including ''Deliorman'' and ''Turan''), and by 1939, a single newspaper ''Havadis'' (\"The News\") survived, only to be closed down in turn in 1941. The explanation cited was that the newspapers were disseminating Kemalist (i.e. Turkish nationalist) propaganda.<ref name=\"bghelsinki.org\">[http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508224135/http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc|date=8 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Transfer of Land====\nThe transfer of land from [[Turkish people|Turkish]] to [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] ownership which was the most important effect of Turkish emigration was a complex process. Such transfers had taken place before 1878, for example parts in the [[Pazardzhik|Tatar Pazardzhik]] district, where Bulgarian landowners had been unknown in 1840 {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, some two thousand plots had been bought by them between 1872 and 1875. In 1877 and in the following years the process of transfer took place on an immensely greater scale, both here and elsewhere.<ref>Crampton 1983, pp.178</ref> In 1875 some 50% of the land in [[Rumelia]] was owned by Turks.<ref>Crampton, R. J, \"Bulgaria\" Oxford University Press, 2007, pp.288</ref> A decade after 1878 as much as a quarter of the arable land in Bulgaria transferred from Turkish to Bulgarian ownership.<ref>Crampton, R. J., \"A Short History of Modern Bulgaria\" Cambridge University Press, 1987, pp.71</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78|war]] some [[Turkish people|Turks]] sold their property, mostly to wealthy local Bulgarians. Other Turks rented their lands, usually to dependable local Bulgarians, on the understanding that it would be handed back if and when the owners returned. Most departing Turks, however, simply abandoned their land and fled, the fall of [[Pleven]] had made it clear that the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] were to win the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|War]]. As the Turks fled many Bulgarians seized some of the land now made vacant.<ref>Stephen K. Wegren: \"Land reform in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe\" 1998 pp.209</ref> The incidence of seizure varied regionally. In the north-east the Turks were numerous and, feeling safety in numbers, few of them had left and those remaining were therefore strong enough to discourage seizures by Bulgarians. In the north and south-west on the other hand almost all Turks had fled and their lands were immediately taken over by local Bulgarians who often divided up the large estates found in these areas. In the remainder of northern Bulgaria transfers, often under the cloak of renting, took place in approximately one third of the communities. In the [[Veliko Tarnovo Province|Turnovo]] province, for example, there were seventy-seven Turkish mixed Turkish-Bulgarian villages of which twenty-four (31.0%) were seized by Bulgarians, twenty two (28.5%) were later repossessed by returning Turkish refugees, and another twenty-two remained unaffected; the fate of the remaining nine is unknown. In the south-west there was much more tension and violence. Here there was no provisions about renting and there were cases of Bulgarian peasants not only seizing land but also destroying buildings.<ref>Crampton 1983, pp.179</ref>\n\nIn the vast majority of cases it was local Bulgarians who seized the vacant land but Bulgarians from other parts of Bulgaria where there had been little Turkish emigration and Bulgarian refugees from Ottoman repressions in Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]] also took part in the seizures. In later months the publication of the terms of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] naturally intensified the flow of refugees from these areas and according to the prefect of [[Burgas]] province as helping themselves to \u00e9migr\u00e9 land \"in a most arbitrary fashion\" {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.\n\nIn [[Burgas]] and the rest of [[Eastern Rumelia]] the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] intensified the land struggle by making Bulgarians more determined to seize sufficient land before Ottoman sovereignty was restored. It also encouraged the former Turkish owners to return. With these problems the Russian Provisional Administration had to contend.\n\nThe Provisional Administration did not have the power, even if it had had the will, to prevent so popular a movement as the seizure of vacant Turkish land, but nor could the Administration allow this movement to go completely unchecked for this would give the Turks and the British the excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of the liberated territories. Given these dangers the Russians handled the agrarian problem with considerable skill. In the summer of 1877 Bulgarian refugees from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]] and Ottoman [[Rumelia]] had been allowed to harvest the crops left by Turkish \u00e9migr\u00e9s and in September all Bulgarians, the incoming refugees and the indigenous, were allowed to sow vacant Turkish land, though it was insisted that this did not in any way signify a transfer of ownership. With the mass exodus of Turks after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] the Provisional Administration had little choice but to allow the [[Bulgarians]] to work the vacant land with rent, set at half the value of the harvest, to be paid to the legal owner. In many cases the Bulgarians simply refused to pay this rent and the Russians were not over-zealous in collecting it.\n\nWhen the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] guaranteed Turkish property rights and restored southern Bulgaria to the [[Sultan|Sultan's]] sovereignty at least 80,000 of the 150,000 Turkish \u00e9migr\u00e9s had returned by September 1878. This caused enormous problems including housing the returning Turks whose property had been taken over by Bulgarians or destroyed. In September local authorities ordered that any houses taken over by Bulgarians were to be restored to their former owners on the latter's demand, whilst other returning [[Turkish people|Turks]] were given [[Tatar]] or [[Circassians|Circassian]] land.\n\nThese problems were insignificant compared to those raised when the returning Turks demanded the restitution of their lost lands.\n\nIn July 1878 the Russian Provisional Administration had come to an agreement with the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] by which Turkish refugees were allowed to return under military escort, if necessary, and were to have their lands back on condition that they surrendered all their weapons. In August 1878 it was decreed that those returning would not be immune from prosecution and anyone against whom any charges were substantiated would be deprived of his lands. This decree, more than anything else, discouraged the return of more Turks and from the date of this enactment the flow of returning refugees began gradually to diminish. There were, however, many claims still to be dealt with and in November 1878 mixed Turkish and Bulgarian commissions were established in all provinces to examine these claims. The decisions were to be made in accordance with rules drawn up by the Russian embassy in [[Constantinople]] in consultation with the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], and under them Bulgarians could secure the legal right to a piece of land if they could produce the authentic title-deeds, tapii, and thereby prove that the land at dispute had originally been taken from them forcibly or fraudulently.\n\nAfter the departure of the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] in the spring of 1879 the administration in Plovdiv ordered to enforce court decisions returning land to the Turks. Only half of the courts had recorded such decisions. Other actions were even less emotive and in 1880 the position of the Bulgarians in [[Eastern Rumelia]] had improved. The [[Plovdiv]] government introduced new methods for authenticating claims, allowing local courts to issue new title deeds if they were satisfied that existing documentation proved ownership, or if local communal councils had issued certificates attesting ownership. Most local councils were entirely Bulgarian or were dominated by [[Bulgarians]] and decided in favour of their co-nationals far more often than did the mixed commissions with whom the prerogative of adjunction had previously rested. In many instances, too, [[Bulgarians]] refused to relinquish land they had seized and as late as 1884 there were still Turkish landlords demanding the implementation of court orders restoring their property.\n\nThe [[Bulgarians]] in [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] were also helped from 1880 onwards because the [[Turkish People|Turks]] began to drift once more into exile. This was very much the result of disappointed hopes for a full restoration of Turkish power south of the Balkan range. By 1880 the [[Bulgarians]] had gained complete control of the province and to this many Turks, and particularly the richer and previously more influential ones, could not adapt. The Turks had never allowed the [[Bulgarians]] social or legal equality. Now they were forced to concede their superiority and for many Turks this was too much to bear and they gratefully accepted offers of land from the Sultan and returned to the more familiar atmosphere of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThe [[Turkish People|Turks]] were also encouraged to emigrate from [[Bulgaria]] by regulations which affected the cultivation of rice \u2013 which was originally introduced to the region by the Turks. This was part of a project to eradicate malaria that included also draining of swamps in the Tundzha, Arda, and Maritsa Basins. The project succeeded in eradicating malaria, however, it also exacerbated droughts in those regions. Rice was a staple crop for the Turks and in its prohibition many of them saw yet another sign of unacceptable Bulgarian domination. An even more important impulse to Turkish emigration was the Bulgarian land tax of 1882. By [[Moslem]] law all land was owned by [[God]] but after the abolition of feudalism in the 1830s use of that land conferred temporary wardship upon the user, and thus the tithe which had been the main levy on land until 1882 conformed to traditional Moslem codes of thought and practice. The land tax did not. Furthermore, land tax applied to all land in a man's possession not, as under the tithe, merely to that part which had been cultivated. This hit the Turks hard for they customarily left a large proportion, in many cases as much as half, of their land fallow. Taxation now fell on the fallow land too but production and earnings could not be increased by the same proportion and as a result many of the remaining Turkish owners of large estates left Rumelia. Significantly 1882 was the peak year for the sale of larger Turkish properties in Rumelia, though the sale of such properties continued steadily throughout the first half of the 1880s. From the end of the war to the summer of 1880 only six large Turkish chifliks in [[Eastern Rumelia]] had been sold but the five years before union with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885 saw the sale of about a hundred. That most of the larger Turkish owners and many smaller ones left [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] was undoubtedly an important factor in the easy attainment of Bulgarian supremacy in [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] during the early 1880s.\n\nIn [[Principality of Bulgaria]] as in [[Eastern Rumelia|Rumelia]] the chaos of war had allowed a number of seizures to go unrecorded meaning that the new occupiers were to be left in untroubled possession of their land. The Constituent Assembly had considered a proposal to legislate such illegal transfers but no action had been taken as [[Lyuben Karavelov|Karavelov]] had easily persuaded the Assembly that it was pointless to legislate about so widespread a phenomenon. The [[Bulgarians]] in the [[Principality of Bulgaria|Principality]] could afford such bold stance as there was little danger of direct Ottoman intervention over the land question. There was a constant stream of emigration by Turks from Bulgaria and by the early 1890s so many Turks had left the former Turkish stronghold of north-eastern Bulgaria that the government in [[Sofia]] began to fear that the area would be seriously under-populated. In 1891 the Minister of Finance reported to the Subranie that there were 26,315 vacant plots in the country, many of them in the north-east and most of them under twenty dekars in extent.\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] the government also took possession of Turkish land which had been vacant for three years. A number of returning Turkish refugees who demanded restitution of or compensation for their lands were denied both on the grounds that they had without duress left their property unworked for three years.<ref>Crampton 1983, pp.183</ref> Land rights of Muslim owners were largely disregarded despite of being guaranteed by the powers.

The official Turkish language became the language of a minority. In 1875 there were 2,700 Turkish primary schools, 40 secondary schools and 150 ''medreses'' in the [[Danube Vilayet]]. By 1913 the number of Turkish schools was reduced to 1,234 all of which had to be financed by the Turkish community.\n\nFollowing the First World War the Bulgarian government provided financial assistance to the Turkish schools and their number grew to 1,712 with 60,481 pupils. As the fascist regime gained power in 1934, Turkish school, which had adopted the Latin alphabet following the reforms in Turkey, were forced to teach in the Arabic script. This was in order to reduce the nationalistic influences coming from Turkey.\n\nAs the Communists took control in Bulgaria in 1944 they delivered on their promises for more liberties for the ethnic minorities. Turkish schools were reopened and the usage of the Latin script allowed. The new regime however nationalised the schools and took them under state control. In 1944 there were 84,603 Turkish children in school age, 40,388 of whom did not attend school. According to the law, graduates from Turkish schools were considered as illiterate.\n\nIn 1956 the number of Turkish schools is put at 1,149 with 100,843 pupils and 4,527 teachers. After 1958 the Turkish language in these schools was replaced with Bulgarian as the official language and Turkish became an elected subject. After 1970 teaching Turkish in schools was abolished and by 1984 the use of the Turkish language itself was deemed illegal. The only two remaining bi-lingual journals ''Yeni I\u015f\u0131k'' and ''Yeni Hayat'' were printed in Bulgarian only.<ref>Suleiman, Yasir, . \"Language and identity in the Middle East and North Africa \", Cornwall, Great Britain 1996, pp.104\u2013105</ref>\n\n===During Communist rule (1945 to 1989)===\n\n==== Initial improvements (1944\u20131956) ====\nAfter the Communist takeover in 1944, the new regime declared itself in favour of all minorities and inter-ethnic equality and fraternity (in accordance with the classic doctrine of [[proletarian internationalism]]) and annulled all the \"[[fascist]]\" anti-Muslim decisions of the previous government.<ref name=helsinki35>[http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee: The Human Rights of Muslims in Bulgaria in Law and Politics since 1878] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007234907/http://www.bghelsinki.org/upload/resources/2003_Muslims_fm.doc |date=7 October 2006 }} (p.35)</ref> This included banning the \"Rodina\" organization,<ref name=helsinki35/> re-establishing the closed Turkish minority schools and founding new ones.

With this explicit policy, enacted between 1984 and 1989, the Bulgarian government forced Bulgaria's Turkish community \u2013 900,000 people or 10 percent of the country's population, to change their names. The people affected were all ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]]. By 1984 other Muslims, mostly the [[Muslim Roma]] and the [[Pomaks]] had already been forced to give up their [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Muslim]] names for [[Christian name]]s. The government had been encouraging the educated Turks to voluntarily adopt Bulgarian names.\n\nThe exact reasons for Zhivkov's mass-scale assimilation programme are unclear, but it is believed that one of the main factors was the projection that by 1990 the Bulgarian population would experience a zero or negative population growth resulting in increasing Muslim population and declining Bulgarian population.<ref>Eminov, Ali: Turkish and Other Muslim Minorities of Bulgaria, 1997, pp.92</ref>\n\nIn June 1984, the Politburo voted a policy named \"For the further unification and inclusion of Turks into the cause of socialism and the policies of the Bulgarian Communist Party\".

On 29 December, the government allowed the Turks of Bulgaria to resume use of their Turkish names. This decision was recognized by law in March 1990. By 1991, some 600&nbsp;thousand applications were received for the reinstatement of Turkish birth given names. Also in 1991, the Institutition of the Spiritual leader of the Muslims in Bulgaria, the Grand Mufti's Office was founded. In 1991 a new Constitution was adopted granting citizens of non-Bulgarian origin a wide range of rights and lifting the legislative ban on teaching in Turkish. In January of the same year another law was adopted allowing the Turks to change their names or \"strike out\" their Slavonic endings like \"ov\", \"ova\", \"ev\", \"eva\" within three years.<ref name=\"noravank1\">[http://www.noravank.am/file/article/257_en.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229172208/http://www.noravank.am/file/article/257_en.pdf|date=29 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAs in other parts of [[Eastern Europe]], the repeal of single-party rule in Bulgaria exposed the long-standing grievances of an ethnic minority. The urban intelligentsia that participated in the 1990 reform movement pushed the post-[[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] governments toward restoring constitutionally guaranteed human rights to the Turks. But abrogation of Zhivkov's assimilation program soon after his fall brought massive protests by ethnic Bulgarians.\n\nIn January 1990, the Social Council of Citizens, a national body representing all political and ethnic groups, reached a compromise that guaranteed the Turks freedom of religion, choice of names, and unimpeded practice of cultural traditions and use of Turkish within the community. In turn the Bulgarians were promised that Bulgarian would remain the official language and that no movement for autonomy or separatism would be tolerated. Especially in areas where Turks outnumbered Bulgarians, the latter feared progressive \"Islamification\" or even invasion and annexation by Turkey\u2014a fear that was based on the traditional enmity after the Ottoman rule and had been stirred up after the 1974 invasion of Cyprus. This had been part of the propaganda during by the Zhivkov assimilation campaign and was revived by politicians in post-Communist Bulgaria. Because radical elements of the Turkish population did advocate separatism, however, the non-annexation provision of the compromise was vital.\n\nThe Bulgarian governments that followed Zhivkov tried to realize the conditions of the compromise as quickly as possible. In the multiparty election of 1990, the Turks won representation in the National Assembly by twenty-three candidates of the predominantly Turkish [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] (MRF). At that point, ethnic Bulgarians, many remaining from the Zhivkov regime, still held nearly all top jobs in government and industry, even in the predominantly Turkish Kurdzhali Province. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Parts of Bulgarian society felt threatened by the rise of the MRF. The Bulgarian National Radical Party (BNRP) threatened to surround the Bulgarian Parliament building on the day of the newly elected legislature was scheduled to convene. The BNRP protested the participation of ethnic Turks in the National Assembly and the teaching of Turkish language as a standard curriculum in secondary school with large numbers of Turkish students.<ref>Janusz Bugajski: \"Political parties of Eastern Europe: a guide to politics in the post\" 2002 pp.804</ref>\n\nThe [[Patriotic Party of Labour]] (OPT) was established as the political wing of the National Committee for Defense of National Interests (CDNI). According to its own historiography the OPT emerged due to pressure from ordinary Bulgarian citizens who were outraged by the fact that the MRF was allowed to participate in the 1990 elections. CDNI members were mainly small-shop owners, artisans, farmers and elements of the local [[communist]] nomenklatura. The CDNI did not limit itself to rhetoric but also arranged protests against ethnic Turks returning to Bulgaria to claim back their names and property. In October 1991 violent outbreaks occurred between Bulgarian nationalists and Turkish activists in [[Razgrad]].<ref name=\"Janusz Bugajski pp.805-807\">Janusz Bugajski: \"Political parties of Eastern Europe: a guide to politics in the post\" 2002 pp.805\u2013807</ref>\n\nBulgarian nationalist forces tried to take advantage of the country's hard economic and uncertain political conditions. In November 1990 massive protests were staged by Bulgarian nationalists in [[Razgrad]] area inhabited by a large number of Turks. The nationalists declared an \"independent Bulgarian republic\" and refused to recognize Sofia's authority over the region.

In 1991 the most important issue of the controversy was restoring Turkish language teaching in the schools of Turkish ethnic districts. In 1991 the Popov government took initial steps in this direction, but long delays brought massive Turkish protests, especially in Kurdzhali. In mid-1991 continuing strikes and protests on both sides of the issue had brought no new discussions of compromise.

The leader of the movement, [[Ahmed Dogan]], was imprisoned in 1986. Founded in 1990 to represent the interests of the Turkish ethnic minority, the MRF gained twenty three seats in the first parliamentary election that year, giving it the fourth-largest parliamentary voting bloc. Its agenda precluded mass media coverage or building coalitions with other parties, because of the strong anti-Turkish element in Bulgaria's political culture. By mid-1991, the UDF had held only one joint demonstration with the MRF; their failure to reconcile differences was considered a major weakness in the opposition to the majority BSP. In early 1990, the MRF protested vigorously but unsuccessfully its exclusion from national round table discussions among the major Bulgarian parties.\n\nIn 1991 the MRF broadened its platform to embrace all issues of civil rights in Bulgaria, aiming \"to contribute to the unity of the Bulgarian people and to the full and unequivocal compliance with the rights and freedoms of mankind and of all ethnic, religious, and cultural communities in Bulgaria.\" The MRF took this step partly to avoid the constitutional prohibition of political parties based on ethnic or religious groups. The group's specific goals were ensuring that the new constitution protect ethnic minorities adequately; introducing Turkish as an optional school subject; and bringing to trial the leaders of the assimilation campaign in the 1980s. To calm Bulgarian concerns, the MRF categorically renounced Islamic fundamentalism, terrorism, and ambitions for autonomy within Bulgaria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/55.htm |title=Bulgaria \u2013 The Public And Political Decision Making |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BG Parliamentary 2013 pie EN.png|250px|right|thumb|2013 Parliamentary election, distribution of votes by constituency (Movement for Rights and Freedoms in purple)]]\n[[File:BG Parliamentary 2013 grid.png|250px|right|thumb|Distribution of seats by constituency from the election]]\n\nIn the first general [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|elections in 1990]] after the communist regime which the Muslims boycotted, the party won 6.0% of the popular vote and 24 out of 400 seats and became the fourth largest party in the parliament. In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|parliamentary elections in 1991]] it won 7.6% of the vote and remained with 24 seats in \u0430 240-seat parliament. In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1994|elections in 1994]] it won 5.4% of the vote and its seats decreased to 15.

It won in the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2001|elections in 2001]] 7.5% of the vote and 21 out of 240 seats. Subsequently, for the first time the party joined a coalition government, which was led by the winner of the elections ([[NDSV]]). Under the control of the party were 2 out of 17 [[Government of Bulgaria|Bulgarian ministries]] \u2013 the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Food (Bulgaria)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forests]] and the [[Minister without portfolio]], the rest 15 remained under the control of [[NDSV]].\n\nAt the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 elections]] it increased to 12.8% of vote and 34 out of 240 seats and kept in power as a part of the coalition led by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|BSP]] and [[NDSV]] party. The ministries under the control of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms increased to 3 out of 18. In the budget of 2008, MRF directed a large parts of the subsidies for agriculture to tobacco growers (which are predominantly Turks, Pomaks, and Romani) leaving staple crops, like wheat, without subsidies for buying the seed for sowing. This evoked protests by farmers in the regions of Vratsa, Knezha, and Dobrudzha.\n\nAt the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 elections]] it increased to 14.0% of vote and 37 out of 240 seats. Following the election, the government was totally occupied by the decisive winner, the [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]] party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms returned to opposition after being part of coalition governments two consecutive terms between 2001 and 2009. At the [[2009 European Parliament election in Bulgaria|2009 European Parliament elections]] the party won 14.1% of the vote and 3 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] out of 18. Two of the MEPs are ethnic Turks ([[Filiz Husmenova]] and [[Metin Kazak]]) and one ([[Vladko Panayotov]]) is [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]].\n\nAccording to exit polls of the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|Bulgarian parliamentary election in 2013]], the Movement for Rights and Freedoms gained 11.3% of the vote, it keeps 36 seats and remains the third largest voting bloc. The party won the elections in five regions where the Muslim population resides \u2013  Kardzhali, Razgrad, Silistra, Targovishte and Shumen provinces; the party also wins abroad with 49% of the vote, in general the most polling stations and voters in a foreign country wherever were in Turkey, from where the party included 50,000 votes more to its result of 350,000 votes. Another Turkish party, founded in 2011 and headed by [[Korman Ismailov]] \u2013 [[People's Party Freedom and Dignity]] (PPFD) in a coalition with [[NDSV]] won 1.531% of the vote and therefore did not cross the 4% threshold to enter the parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/pi2013/rezultati/index.html |title=\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 :: \u0418\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 2013 |publisher=Results.cik.bg |accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> Another political party founded in 1998 and representing a smaller fraction of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria is the National Movement for Rights and Freedoms (NMRF), which do not participate in the parliamentary elections.

The village contains Algarve style whitewashed houses, traditional [[chimney]]s, and cobbled alleys. The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet [[C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro]] was born in Alte, in 1871.\n\n== Church of Our Lady of the Assumption ==\n\nThe Mother Church of Alte or Church of Our Lady of the Assumption is located at the centre of the village of Alte on Largo da Igreja. The first church built here was constructed in the 13th century but this church was rebuilt at the start of the 16th century. The architecture of the church is in the Manueline style.\nThe main west facing fa\u00e7ade has a fine doorway with carved stone architraves. Through this door is the Nave. The chancel is decorated with 18th century tiles. There are important works of art in the church which include the Baroque altarpiece in the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmel), and the altarpieces on the side altars which are in the Rococo style. There is also a fine collection of statues, including an ivory statue of Our Lady of Santa Margarida (St Margaret), of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmel) and of the dead Christ, all dating from the 18th century. There is also a small museum where there are two Mannerist pictures and a number of 17th century statues.\n\n== C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro ==\n\nThe [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro was born in a house located on Rua Poeta C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro, Alte on the 3 December 1871. His full name was '''Francisco Xavier C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro''' He was a post-symbolist poet, playwright and a Lawyer. He graduated in Law from the University of Coimbra in 1907. He practiced as a notary in Loul\u00e9  and in Faro. He also became president of the Municipalities of Loul\u00e9 and Faro in the period between 1923 and 1941.

The village contains Algarve style whitewashed houses, traditional [[chimney]]s, and cobbled alleys. The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet [[C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro]] was born in Alte, in 1871.\n\n== Church of Our Lady of the Assumption ==\n\nThe Mother Church of Alte or Church of Our Lady of the Assumption is located at the centre of the village of Alte on Largo da Igreja. The first church built here was constructed in the 13th century but this church was rebuilt at the start of the 16th century. The architecture of the church is in the Manueline style.\nThe main west facing fa\u00e7ade has a fine doorway with carved stone architraves. Through this door is the Nave. The chancel is decorated with 18th century tiles. There are important works of art in the church which include the Baroque altarpiece in the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmel), and the altarpieces on the side altars which are in the Rococo style. There is also a fine collection of statues, including an ivory statue of Our Lady of Santa Margarida (St Margaret), of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmel) and of the dead Christ, all dating from the 18th century. There is also a small museum where there are two Mannerist pictures and a number of 17th century statues.\n\n== C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro ==\n\nThe [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro was born in a house located on Rua Poeta C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro, Alte on the 3 December 1871. His full name was '''Francisco Xavier C\u00e2ndido Guerreiro''' He was a post-symbolist poet, playwright and a Lawyer. He graduated in Law from the University of Coimbra in 1907. He practiced as a notary in Loul\u00e9  and in Faro. He also became president of the Municipalities of Loul\u00e9 and Faro in the period between 1923 and 1941.

The clearing and logging that proceeded along the territory, and from the agrarian structure and morphology of the land, settlement must have progressed from east to west, until the parish of Raminho (which was then known as Folhadais) was last to be settled.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nDue the island's date of colonization and the progress of settlement along the north, the first occupation occurred around 1460, resulting in the foundation by the end of the 15th century. The fertility of the soils supported the establishment of agriculture and [[woad]] commerce (today remembered in the name of the ''Canada dos Engenhos'') which helped establish the wealth of many of the Terceirense families. Referring to agriculture in Altares, Gaspar Frutuoso affirmed:\n:''Until the Church of S\u00e3o Roque the land is flat, almost half a league from the square, and weak, providing little wheat and much, thin woad, that which has lowest price among all the others, to have mixed \"bagacina\", almost like pumice; pastel costs little to do and less weeding for the land give little grass.''<ref>Gaspar Frutuoso (1590), p.16.</ref>\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, the first important settlers arrived on the island, such as Jo\u00e3o Valad\u00e3o, Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares Pamplona (founder of Arrochela), Manuel Borges da Costa (descendant of Jo\u00e3o Borges \"The Older\", one of the first inhabitants on the island) and Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Homem (relative of \u00c1lvaro Martins Homem), founder of the city of Angra.<ref>Alfredo Lucas, Ermidas da Ilha Terceira, Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (1976)</ref> One of Jo\u00e3o Valad\u00e3o daughters married Martim Sim\u00e3o (later identified with the toponymy of the parish, for example ''Pico de Matias Sim\u00e3o'' or ''Pico de Martim Sim\u00e3o'').\n\nIt is unclear when the settlement was elevated to the status of parish, but it may have occurred before 1480, associated with a reference to a parish priest.<ref>Francisco Ferreira Drumond (1489), Vol.I, Cap.V</ref> The limits of the parish were relatively undefined, but included the northwest of the island, from Faj\u00e3 (today an uninhabited site below Mata da Serreta and territory in the parish of Serreta) to the locality of Ponta Negra, including a part of Arrochela (today part of Biscoitos).\n\nThe centre of the parish, dominated by parochial church, was founded on the margins of the ''Ribeira de S\u00e3o Roque'', in the immediate confluence of the ''Ribeira das Lajinhas'', an area covered in vegetation and dominated by a large, evergreen bog. The settlement was supported by ravines and natural springs that ran from the mountainous ''Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara'', some {{convert|4|km|mi}} from the settlement.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Altares Azores.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Seaside farms in Altares]]\nThe parish is located in the northwestern part of the island, about 19 kilometres from the city of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo. It is bounded on the east by the parish of [[Biscoitos]], which belongs to the municipality of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]], on the west by the parish of [[Raminho]], on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south and southwest by the caldera of the Santa B\u00e1rbara volcano and by the [[Santa B\u00e1rbara (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo)|parish also called Santa B\u00e1rbara]].\n\nAltares is located along the northern flanks of the ''Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara'' massif, extending from the northern and western edges of the [[caldera]] of Santa Barbara volcano to the seaside cliffs on the north coast of the island. Topographically, the civil parish is bounded on the east by the course of the ''Ribeira do Pamplona'' (''Pamplona Ravine''), which also serves as the border to the municipality of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, and on the west by a line drawn from the {{convert|827|m|ft}} summit of ''Pico Rachado'' to the sea. This line follows the course of the ''Ribeira dos Gatos'' (''Ravine of the Cats''), but then it diverts to the west to include the hamlet of ''Cerro da Ribeira dos Gatos'', a ridge of hills and miscellaneous buildings.\n\nThe territory of the parish rises gradually from the coast, first as a relatively gentle slope, but at an increasingly rugged grade as one approaches the heights of the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara, where five streams have their sources: the ''Riberia dos Gatos'', the ''Ribeira de S\u00e3o Roque'', the ''Ribeira das Lajinhas'', the ''Ribeira da Lapa'', and the ''Ribeira do Pamplona''. Although crossed by various river courses, the parish is actually poor in hydrographic resources, since surface water is intermittent. In fact, ravine water is primarily from intense precipitation in the foothills, lasting a short time normally.<ref name=\"JFregusia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jfaltares.pt/turismo/freguesia.php |location=Altares (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo), Portugal |language=Portuguese |title=A Freguesia |editor=Junta Freguesia |publisher=Junta Freguesia de Altares |accessdate=28 May 2012 |year=2011}}</ref> This was not the case during the period of early colonization, since the forest and tuber vegetation would regulate waterflow, resulting in light continuously flowing streams throughout the year.<ref name=JFregusia/> From east to west, the following ravines are the primarily affluent in the parish:\n* ''Ribeira do Pamplona'', apart from delimiting the parish, it is also the frontier of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo;\n* ''Ribeira de Lapa'', one of the more intensely flowing watercourses;\n* ''Ribeira da Luz'';\n* ''Ribeira de S\u00e3o Roque'', alongside the parochial church (in the centre of the parish), and to its left the ''Ribeira das Lajinhas'';\n* ''Ribeira dos Gatos''\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:Igr s roque altares 1.jpg|thumb|235px|The single-nave parochial Church of S\u00e3o Roque dating to the 15th century]]\n[[File:Imperio altares 2.jpg|thumb|235px|The Imp\u00e9rio of the Holy Spirit, a modern ''imp\u00e9rio'' used in religious celebrations annually]]\nFor many years after settlement, small nuclei coalesced around the roadways parallel the coast dominated by chapels and hermitages, transforming into centre of the religious cults: the Hermitage of Santa Catarina of the Pamplona family (constructed in 1525) centre of the locality of Arrochela;<ref>To this hermitage were transferred the remains of General [[Manuel In\u00e1cio Martins Pamplona Corte Real, 1st Count of Subserra|Manuel In\u00e1cio Martins Pamplona]], who was a ''Ministro Assistente ao Despacho'' in the government of King D.

The clearing and logging that proceeded along the territory, and from the agrarian structure and morphology of the land, settlement must have progressed from east to west, until the parish of Raminho (which was then known as Folhadais) was last to be settled.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nDue the island's date of colonization and the progress of settlement along the north, the first occupation occurred around 1460, resulting in the foundation by the end of the 15th century. The fertility of the soils supported the establishment of agriculture and [[woad]] commerce (today remembered in the name of the ''Canada dos Engenhos'') which helped establish the wealth of many of the Terceirense families. Referring to agriculture in Altares, Gaspar Frutuoso affirmed:\n:''Until the Church of S\u00e3o Roque the land is flat, almost half a league from the square, and weak, providing little wheat and much, thin woad, that which has lowest price among all the others, to have mixed \"bagacina\", almost like pumice; pastel costs little to do and less weeding for the land give little grass.''<ref>Gaspar Frutuoso (1590), p.16.</ref>\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, the first important settlers arrived on the island, such as Jo\u00e3o Valad\u00e3o, Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares Pamplona (founder of Arrochela), Manuel Borges da Costa (descendant of Jo\u00e3o Borges \"The Older\", one of the first inhabitants on the island) and Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Homem (relative of \u00c1lvaro Martins Homem), founder of the city of Angra.<ref>Alfredo Lucas, Ermidas da Ilha Terceira, Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (1976)</ref> One of Jo\u00e3o Valad\u00e3o daughters married Martim Sim\u00e3o (later identified with the toponymy of the parish, for example ''Pico de Matias Sim\u00e3o'' or ''Pico de Martim Sim\u00e3o'').\n\nIt is unclear when the settlement was elevated to the status of parish, but it may have occurred before 1480, associated with a reference to a parish priest.<ref>Francisco Ferreira Drumond (1489), Vol.I, Cap.V</ref> The limits of the parish were relatively undefined, but included the northwest of the island, from Faj\u00e3 (today an uninhabited site below Mata da Serreta and territory in the parish of Serreta) to the locality of Ponta Negra, including a part of Arrochela (today part of Biscoitos).\n\nThe centre of the parish, dominated by parochial church, was founded on the margins of the ''Ribeira de S\u00e3o Roque'', in the immediate confluence of the ''Ribeira das Lajinhas'', an area covered in vegetation and dominated by a large, evergreen bog. The settlement was supported by ravines and natural springs that ran from the mountainous ''Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara'', some {{convert|4|km|mi}} from the settlement.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Altares Azores.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Seaside farms in Altares]]\nThe parish is located in the northwestern part of the island, about 19 kilometres from the city of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo. It is bounded on the east by the parish of [[Biscoitos]], which belongs to the municipality of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]], on the west by the parish of [[Raminho]], on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south and southwest by the caldera of the Santa B\u00e1rbara volcano and by the [[Santa B\u00e1rbara (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo)|parish also called Santa B\u00e1rbara]].\n\nAltares is located along the northern flanks of the ''Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara'' massif, extending from the northern and western edges of the [[caldera]] of Santa Barbara volcano to the seaside cliffs on the north coast of the island. Topographically, the civil parish is bounded on the east by the course of the ''Ribeira do Pamplona'' (''Pamplona Ravine''), which also serves as the border to the municipality of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, and on the west by a line drawn from the {{convert|827|m|ft}} summit of ''Pico Rachado'' to the sea. This line follows the course of the ''Ribeira dos Gatos'' (''Ravine of the Cats''), but then it diverts to the west to include the hamlet of ''Cerro da Ribeira dos Gatos'', a ridge of hills and miscellaneous buildings.\n\nThe territory of the parish rises gradually from the coast, first as a relatively gentle slope, but at an increasingly rugged grade as one approaches the heights of the Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara, where five streams have their sources: the ''Riberia dos Gatos'', the ''Ribeira de S\u00e3o Roque'', the ''Ribeira das Lajinhas'', the ''Ribeira da Lapa'', and the ''Ribeira do Pamplona''. Although crossed by various river courses, the parish is actually poor in hydrographic resources, since surface water is intermittent. In fact, ravine water is primarily from intense precipitation in the foothills, lasting a short time normally.<ref name=\"JFregusia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jfaltares.pt/turismo/freguesia.php |location=Altares (Angra do Hero\u00edsmo), Portugal |language=Portuguese |title=A Freguesia |editor=Junta Freguesia |publisher=Junta Freguesia de Altares |accessdate=28 May 2012 |year=2011}}</ref> This was not the case during the period of early colonization, since the forest and tuber vegetation would regulate waterflow, resulting in light continuously flowing streams throughout the year.<ref name=JFregusia/> From east to west, the following ravines are the primarily affluent in the parish:\n* ''Ribeira do Pamplona'', apart from delimiting the parish, it is also the frontier of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo;\n* ''Ribeira de Lapa'', one of the more intensely flowing watercourses;\n* ''Ribeira da Luz'';\n* ''Ribeira de S\u00e3o Roque'', alongside the parochial church (in the centre of the parish), and to its left the ''Ribeira das Lajinhas'';\n* ''Ribeira dos Gatos''\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:Igr s roque altares 1.jpg|thumb|235px|The single-nave parochial Church of S\u00e3o Roque dating to the 15th century]]\n[[File:Imperio altares 2.jpg|thumb|235px|The Imp\u00e9rio of the Holy Spirit, a modern ''imp\u00e9rio'' used in religious celebrations annually]]\nFor many years after settlement, small nuclei coalesced around the roadways parallel the coast dominated by chapels and hermitages, transforming into centre of the religious cults: the Hermitage of Santa Catarina of the Pamplona family (constructed in 1525) centre of the locality of Arrochela;<ref>To this hermitage were transferred the remains of General [[Manuel In\u00e1cio Martins Pamplona Corte Real, 1st Count of Subserra|Manuel In\u00e1cio Martins Pamplona]], who was a ''Ministro Assistente ao Despacho'' in the government of King D.
