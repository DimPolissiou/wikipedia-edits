He founded [[extreme metal]] band [[Strapping Young Lad]] and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist from 1994 to 2007, and has an extensive career as a solo artist.\nAfter performing in a number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in [[education in Canada|high school]], Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and asked to perform lead vocals on [[Steve Vai]]'s album ''[[Sex & Religion]]''. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'' in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.\n\nTownsend's solo albums, a mix of [[hard rock]], [[progressive metal]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[New-age music|new-age]], have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed the Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again, and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. The project began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011, each written in a different style. Townsend continued to record and tour under the new moniker until January 2018.\n\nAcross all his bands and projects, Townsend has released twenty-three studio albums and four live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked [[wall of sound]], has been compared to the styles of [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. His vocal delivery ranges from [[screaming (music)|screaming]] to an opera-esque [[clean vocals|singing]]. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early musical career (1972\u20131994)===\nDevin Townsend was born in [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], on May 5, 1972.<ref name=\"Devin Townsend Biography\">{{cite web |title=Devin Townsend Biography |publisher=HevyDevy Records |author=Turner, Tracy |url=http://www.hevydevy.com/hdr_biography.html |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626183214/http://www.hevydevy.com/hdr_biography.html |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}</ref> Townsend picked up the banjo when he was five, and began playing guitar when he was 12.<ref name=\"allmusic-biography\">\"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p220909|pure_url=yes}} Devin Townsend Overview].\" ''[[AllMusic]]''.

[[Relativity Records]] responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, ''Promise''.<ref name=\"diperna-199309\" /> Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician [[Steve Vai]].

The band, known as [[IR8 vs. Sexoturica|IR8]], featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and [[Tom Hunting]] of [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. \"People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true,\" he explains. \"People took this project way too seriously.\"<ref name=\"hard-rock-interview-1995\" /> A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the [[IR8 vs. Sexoturica]] compilation.\n\nThough Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. \"I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality,\" he later reflected. \"This combination was appalling.\"<ref name=\"lageat-2001\" /> He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music.

Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym [[Strapping Young Lad]]. He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. \"At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have,\" he later explained. \"I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music.\"<ref name=\"lageat-2001\" /> Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', which was released in April 1995.\n\nFollowing the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded his first solo album in 1996 entitled ''[[Punky Br\u00fcster \u2013 Cooked on Phonics]]''. Written and recorded in under a month, the album was produced as a parody of [[punk rock]] bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success. Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album. Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'', including prolific metal drummer [[Gene Hoglan]], along with Townsend's former bandmates [[Jed Simon]] on guitar and [[Byron Stroud]] on bass.

The album, initially entitled ''Biomech'', was recorded in 1995 and originally queued for release later that year in December on [[HevyDevy Records]], a label created by Townsend solely for material he releases on his own. Due to unknown reasons, ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'' was put off for release until late 1996, but when the time came to finally release it, Townsend had become unsatisfied with the recordings and decided to rerecord the album from scratch. Finally released in Japan on July 21, 1997, the album sold 12,000 copies throughout its first week of sales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}-->\n\nAfter the completion of ''City'' and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'', Townsend began to approach a [[mental breakdown]]. He explained, \"I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand.\" In December 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder \"gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's ''City'' record and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech''.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=HevyDevy News for 1998 |url=http://members.home.net/hevydevy/news.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206124933/http://members.home.net/hevydevy/news.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 1998 |website=members.home.net/hevydevy |accessdate=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"fbm-interview\">{{cite web| url=http://www.farbeyondmetal.com/index.php?page_id=1120  |title=Metal Hammer Interviews Devin |publisher=Far Beyond Metal |author=Ingham, Chris |year=1998 |accessdate=November 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522103216/http://www.farbeyondmetal.com/index.php?page_id=1120 |archivedate = May 22, 2007}}</ref> After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that \"everything just clicked\" and he was able to write his third solo album, ''[[Infinity (Devin Townsend album)|Infinity]]'', which he described as \"the parent project\" of ''City'' and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'',<ref name=\"fbm-interview\" /> with music influenced by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"maniacs-200309\" /> Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments.

In the early days of [[Strapping Young Lad]], he was seen playing an ESP [[Flying V]]-style 6-string with a single [[EMG 81]] pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of [[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]], and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar, Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]]-style guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was also seen with two ESP [[Telecaster]] models (one white, one black) with EMG 81 pickups, which were used for the majority of his six-string material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27\" baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups, which closely resembled ESP's [[Stephen Carpenter]] signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC-607 and SC-607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS]] during [[Accelerated Evolution]] and [[Synchestra]]-era shows (mainly for performing \"Deadhead\"). At the time, this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups, but was modified with a [[Seymour Duncan]] STK-S2n Hot Stack in the neck.\n \nAfter returning to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]], and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string [[baritone guitar]] with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup in the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on [[Ziltoid The Omniscient]]. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato unit (for [[Open C tuning|Open C]] and [[Open B tuning]], respectively).\n \nIn 2012, Townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] models, including two [[Sadowsky]] Telecaster models and a number of [[Framus]] [[Semi-acoustic guitar|semi-hollow body guitar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3BwXTb5_1o|title=Video: Devin Townsend on his Framus Guitar|publisher=Framus/Warwick|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522212608/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3BwXTb5_1o|archivedate=May 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3CXJf-NQ4|title=Video: AK1974 \"Mandelbrot\" for Devin Townsend|publisher=Framus/Warwick|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522153838/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3CXJf-NQ4|archivedate=May 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTne4JqnyM|title=Video: Devin Townsend AK1974|publisher=Framus/Warwick|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523022023/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTne4JqnyM|archivedate=May 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: \"The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can\u2019t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V\u2019s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand.\"\n \nFor [[Strapping Young Lad]] and solo projects from 1996 \u2013 2004, Townsend mainly used the [[Peavey 5150]] head, with [[Mesa Boogie]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 4x12 cabinets, for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads, boosted with a [[Maxon Effects|Maxon]] OD808, running into Mesa/Boogie 2x12 cabinets, and Marshall 4x12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] GP-100, which would be amplified by a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings, such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire Mesa/Boogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echo/reverb effects, something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP-100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a [[TC Electronic]] G-Force in tandem with his Mesa/Boogie rig. Townsend also utilizes [[D'Addario (manufacturer)|D'Addario]] Strings (.010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.\n \nAs of 2014, he reintroduced the Dual Rectifier into his rig using a wet-dry-wet setup with the Dual Rectifier being the center dry sound and the AxeFx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the Dual Rectifier as a basis. In 2015, for live shows, the Dual Rectifier was replaced with a Kemper Profiling Amplifier, and the Roland GP-100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal Axe-FX.\n \nAt NAMM 2016, Townsend introduced a signature set of Fishman pickups called Fluence and a signature Framus guitar that features an original body shapes, the Fishman pickups and the [[Evertune]] Bridge.\n\nIn November 2017, Townsend posted to social media and forums that his equipment list had been reduced, explaining how he had eliminated a number of pieces of equipment from his setup. He wrote, \"I was working with many amp companies, but I have made my choice and have settled on a single Axe Fx 2XL+ for my ENTIRE chain.

He founded [[extreme metal]] band [[Strapping Young Lad]] and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist from 1994 to 2007, and has an extensive career as a solo artist.\nAfter performing in a number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in [[education in Canada|high school]], Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and asked to perform lead vocals on [[Steve Vai]]'s album ''[[Sex & Religion]]''. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'' in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.\n\nTownsend's solo albums, a mix of [[hard rock]], [[progressive metal]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[New-age music|new-age]], have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed the Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again, and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. The project began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011, each written in a different style. Townsend continued to record and tour under the new moniker until January 2018.\n\nAcross all his bands and projects, Townsend has released twenty-three studio albums and four live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked [[wall of sound]], has been compared to the styles of [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. His vocal delivery ranges from [[screaming (music)|screaming]] to an opera-esque [[clean vocals|singing]]. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early musical career (1972\u20131994)===\nDevin Townsend was born in [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], on May 5, 1972.<ref name=\"Devin Townsend Biography\">{{cite web |title=Devin Townsend Biography |publisher=HevyDevy Records |author=Turner, Tracy |url=http://www.hevydevy.com/hdr_biography.html |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626183214/http://www.hevydevy.com/hdr_biography.html |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}</ref> Townsend picked up the banjo when he was five, and began playing guitar when he was 12.<ref name=\"allmusic-biography\">\"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p220909|pure_url=yes}} Devin Townsend Overview].\" ''[[AllMusic]]''.

The band, known as [[IR8 vs. Sexoturica|IR8]], featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and [[Tom Hunting]] of [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. \"People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true,\" he explains. \"People took this project way too seriously.\"<ref name=\"hard-rock-interview-1995\" /> A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the [[IR8 vs. Sexoturica]] compilation.\n\nThough Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. \"I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality,\" he later reflected. \"This combination was appalling.\"<ref name=\"lageat-2001\" /> He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music.<ref name=\"chronicles-interview-1995\">{{cite web|title=Bracing for Success \u2013 CoC interviews Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|author=Bromley, Adrian|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-7_strapping_young_lad.aspx|accessdate=January 31, 2008|date=January 10, 1995|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216062732/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-7_strapping_young_lad.aspx|archivedate=December 16, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \"I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve,\" he mused.<ref name=\"hard-rock-interview-1995\" /> While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an [[A&R]] representative for [[Roadrunner Records]], expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him.

He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. \"At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have,\" he later explained. \"I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music.\"<ref name=\"lageat-2001\" /> Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', which was released in April 1995.\n\nFollowing the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded his first solo album in 1996 entitled ''[[Punky Br\u00fcster \u2013 Cooked on Phonics]]''. Written and recorded in under a month, the album was produced as a parody of [[punk rock]] bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success.

In the early days of [[Strapping Young Lad]], he was seen playing an ESP [[Flying V]]-style 6-string with a single [[EMG 81]] pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of [[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]], and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar, Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]]-style guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was also seen with two ESP [[Telecaster]] models (one white, one black) with EMG 81 pickups, which were used for the majority of his six-string material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27\" baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups, which closely resembled ESP's [[Stephen Carpenter]] signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC-607 and SC-607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS]] during [[Accelerated Evolution]] and [[Synchestra]]-era shows (mainly for performing \"Deadhead\"). At the time, this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups, but was modified with a [[Seymour Duncan]] STK-S2n Hot Stack in the neck.\n \nAfter returning to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]], and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string [[baritone guitar]] with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup in the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on [[Ziltoid The Omniscient]]. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato unit (for [[Open C tuning|Open C]] and [[Open B tuning]], respectively).\n \nIn 2012, Townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] models, including two [[Sadowsky]] Telecaster models and a number of [[Framus]] [[Semi-acoustic guitar|semi-hollow body guitar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3BwXTb5_1o|title=Video: Devin Townsend on his Framus Guitar|publisher=Framus/Warwick|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522212608/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3BwXTb5_1o|archivedate=May 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3CXJf-NQ4|title=Video: AK1974 \"Mandelbrot\" for Devin Townsend|publisher=Framus/Warwick|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522153838/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3CXJf-NQ4|archivedate=May 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTne4JqnyM|title=Video: Devin Townsend AK1974|publisher=Framus/Warwick|accessdate=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523022023/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTne4JqnyM|archivedate=May 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: \"The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can\u2019t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V\u2019s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand.\"\n \nFor [[Strapping Young Lad]] and solo projects from 1996 \u2013 2004, Townsend mainly used the [[Peavey 5150]] head, with [[Mesa Boogie]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 4x12 cabinets, for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads, boosted with a [[Maxon Effects|Maxon]] OD808, running into Mesa/Boogie 2x12 cabinets, and Marshall 4x12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] GP-100, which would be amplified by a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings, such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire Mesa/Boogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echo/reverb effects, something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP-100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a [[TC Electronic]] G-Force in tandem with his Mesa/Boogie rig. Townsend also utilizes [[D'Addario (manufacturer)|D'Addario]] Strings (.010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.\n \nAs of 2014, he reintroduced the Dual Rectifier into his rig using a wet-dry-wet setup with the Dual Rectifier being the center dry sound and the AxeFx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the Dual Rectifier as a basis. In 2015, for live shows, the Dual Rectifier was replaced with a Kemper Profiling Amplifier, and the Roland GP-100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal Axe-FX.\n \nAt NAMM 2016, Townsend introduced a signature set of Fishman pickups called Fluence and a signature Framus guitar that features an original body shapes, the Fishman pickups and the [[Evertune]] Bridge.\n\nIn November 2017, Townsend posted to social media and forums that his equipment list had been reduced, explaining how he had eliminated a number of pieces of equipment from his setup. He wrote, \"I was working with many amp companies, but I have made my choice and have settled on a single Axe Fx 2XL+ for my ENTIRE chain. I use Framus Guitars, Fishman Pickups, \nD'Addario strings, Fractal Axe Fx.

He remained rector until 1940. On his retirement the school's name was changed to [[Paul Roos Gymnasium]].\n\nIn the early days of the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902) Stellenbosch was one of the British military bases, and was used as a \"remount\" camp; and in consequence of officers who had not distinguished themselves at the front being sent back to it, the expression \"to be Stellenbosched\" came into use; so much so, that in similar cases officers were spoken of as \"Stellenbosched\" even if they were sent to some other place.\n\n== Population ==\nAt the time of the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]], the population of the urban area of Stellenbosch was 77,476 people in 23,730 households. 50% of the residents spoke [[Afrikaans]] as their [[home language]], 28% spoke [[isiXhosa]], and 8% spoke [[South African English|English]].

In 1804, when the [[Cape Colony]] was ruled by the [[Batavian Republic]], the government assigned an armorial seal to the drostdy. It depicted the shield of arms of [[Simon van der Stel]] superimposed on an anchor representing Hope, on a golden background.<ref name=stell1>{{citation |last=Pama |first=C. |year=1965| title=Lions and Virgins}}</ref> In 1814, the British occupation authorities ordered the drostdyen to use the royal coat of arms instead.<ref name=drostdy>''Cape Town Gazette'' No 418 (15 January 1814).</ref> Van der Stel's arms were quartered: 1 two red towers on a golden background; 2 a [[peacock]] on a red background; 3 three silver discs or balls stacked 1 over 2 on a red background; 4 a red tower on a golden background. In the centre was a smaller blue shield displaying six silver crescents (or, possibly, ribs) 2, 2 and 2.\n* Municipality (1) \u2013 The Stellenbosch municipality was formed in 1840, to administer the town, but not the rest of the district. Although it was not the legal successor to the drostdy, it adopted the old drostdy seal of arms. A few changes<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stellenbosch changes]</ref> were made to the arms over the years: quarters 2 and 3 were changed from red to blue; the peacock was turned to a profile position; the three silver discs or balls were changed to golden rings; the central shield was changed from blue to black. Whether any of these changes was intentional, or whether they were the result of artistic errors, is unclear.\n* Municipality (2) \u2013 The municipal council had a new coat of arms<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stellenbosch new coat of arms]</ref> designed by Michael Dawes in 1951. After some improvements, the [[College of Arms]] granted them on 26 June 1952.

The crest was an anchor entwined with oak leaves and acorns. The motto ''Fortis et superbus'' (\"Strong and proud\") was chosen.\n* Divisional council (1) \u2013 The divisional council, established in 1855, administered the rural areas outside the town. At some point, it adopted the plain Van der Stel arms, i.e. a golden shield displaying three red towers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:Arms of the Divisional Council of Stellenbosch, WC, ZA.svg|thumb|83px|right|Stellenbosch Divisional Council coat of arms (1970)]]\n* Divisional council (2) \u2013 The divisional council had its arms re-designed by [[Cornelis Pama]] in 1970, and registered them at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] on 30 October 1970.<ref name=boh /> The shield was divided down the centre into gold and red, and the three towers were counterchanged.

In the centre was a smaller blue shield displaying six silver crescents (or, possibly, ribs) 2, 2 and 2.\n* Municipality (1) \u2013 The Stellenbosch municipality was formed in 1840, to administer the town, but not the rest of the district. Although it was not the legal successor to the drostdy, it adopted the old drostdy seal of arms. A few changes<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stellenbosch changes]</ref> were made to the arms over the years: quarters 2 and 3 were changed from red to blue; the peacock was turned to a profile position; the three silver discs or balls were changed to golden rings; the central shield was changed from blue to black. Whether any of these changes was intentional, or whether they were the result of artistic errors, is unclear.\n* Municipality (2) \u2013 The municipal council had a new coat of arms<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stellenbosch new coat of arms]</ref> designed by Michael Dawes in 1951. After some improvements, the [[College of Arms]] granted them on 26 June 1952. They were registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] on 31 August 1979.<ref name=boh>[http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za/sm300cv/smws/sm300dl National Archives of South Africa: Data of the Bureau of Heraldry]</ref> The new design was a golden shield displaying the three towers from the Van der Stel arms, and a red fess displaying the peacock between golden rings. The crest was an anchor entwined with oak leaves and acorns. The motto ''Fortis et superbus'' (\"Strong and proud\") was chosen.\n* Divisional council (1) \u2013 The divisional council, established in 1855, administered the rural areas outside the town. At some point, it adopted the plain Van der Stel arms, i.e. a golden shield displaying three red towers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[File:Arms of the Divisional Council of Stellenbosch, WC, ZA.svg|thumb|83px|right|Stellenbosch Divisional Council coat of arms (1970)]]\n* Divisional council (2) \u2013 The divisional council had its arms re-designed by [[Cornelis Pama]] in 1970, and registered them at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] on 30 October 1970.<ref name=boh /> The shield was divided down the centre into gold and red, and the three towers were counterchanged.

In April 2018, she entered the top 200 singles rankings for the first time, becoming only the fifth player representing India to achieve this feat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Srinivasan|first1=Kamesh|title=Ankita Raina in top-200|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ankita-in-top-200/article23484503.ece|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=9 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ankita Raina becomes only third Indian woman tennis player to break into top 200 singles rankings|url=https://www.firstpost.com/sports/ankita-raina-becomes-only-third-indian-woman-tennis-player-to-break-into-top-200-singles-rankings-4425623.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|agency=PTI|date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Raina has also won gold medals in the women's singles and mixed-doubles events at the [[2016 South Asian Games]], and won a bronze medal in singles at the [[Tennis at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]].\n\nPlaying for [[India Fed Cup team|India]] at the [[Fed Cup]], Raina has a win-loss record of 18\u201314.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcup.com/en/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100124146|title=Ankita Raina |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> She has notable wins over [[Zhu Lin (tennis)|Zhu Lin]] (CHN) and [[Yulia Putintseva]] (KAZ), both at the [[2018 Fed Cup]].\n\n==Personal life==\nRaina was born in the western Indian state of [[Gujarat]] to a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family. Her family hails from the town of [[Tral]] in [[Pulwama|Pulwama district]], [[Kashmir]]. Raina is fluent in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and English. Raina briefly studied at [[Brihan Maharashtra]].\n\nAt the national events, Raina has represented her home state [[Gujarat]]. Her idols growing up were [[Roger Federer]], [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Sania Mirza]].\n\nRaina trains at the [[Hemant Bendrey Tennis Academy]] at the [[Deccan Gymkhana#PYC Hindu Gymkhana|PYC Hindu Gymkhana]] in [[Pune]], and is coached by Hemant Bendrey.<ref>[https://celebrityhubspot.com/ankita-raina-biography-profile-records-awards-achievement/ Ankita Raina - Bio]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:2018 Roland Garros Qualifying Tournament - 55 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Raina playing in the qualifying competition of the [[2018 French Open]] \u2013 her first Grand Slam tournament.]]\nRaina started playing tennis at the age of five. Following a promising junior career, Raina made her first professional appearance in 2009, at a small ITF tournament in Mumbai. In 2010, she continued to participate in local ITF events with limited success. Raina's 2011 season saw her advance to three ITF circuit finals in doubles, winning one with countrywoman Aishwarya Agrawal. In 2012, she won her first professional singles title in New Delhi and won three more in doubles. This was followed by a few years of mediocre results on the [[ITF Women's Circuit]].\n\nRaina won two matches at the [[2017 Mumbai Open]], advancing to the biggest quarterfinal of her career. This would turn out to be her breakthrough tournament. In April 2018, she reached a ranking of world No. 181 after winning a $25K ITF title, becoming the fifth Indian national to crack to the top-200 ladies singles rankings, following [[Nirupama Sanjeev]], [[Sania Mirza]], [[Shikha Uberoi]], and [[Sunitha Rao]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Kamesh |title=Ankita Raina in top-200 |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ankita-in-top-200/article23484503.ece |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, Ankita won the bronze medal in the [[2018 Asian Games|Asian Games]] at Jakarta, Indonesia in singles event. Raina and [[Sania Mirza]] are the only players representing India to have won a singles medal at the Asian Games.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ankita Raina settles for bronze at Asian Games |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ankita-raina-settles-for-bronze-at-asian-games/article24758802.ece |accessdate=23 August 2018 |agency=PTI |date=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2019 Kunming Open]], Raina got her first top-100 win, defeating [[Samantha Stosur]], former [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] champion and top 10 player, scoring the biggest win of her career. In October 2019, Raina entered the top 150 doubles rankings for the first time, after reaching the finals of the [[2019 Suzhou Ladies Open]] with partner [[Rosalie van der Hoek]]. She bettered this feat by winning two back-to-back ITF titles in [[Nonthaburi]] alongside [[Bibiane Schoofs]]; followed by reaching her first [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] semifinal at the [[2020 Thailand Open]] alongside Rosalie. This gave Raina a new career-high raking of No. 123 in doubles.\n\n==Playing style==\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nRaina is a steady baseliner who primarily relies on her speed and counterpunching abilities to outlast her opponents.\nShe hits with plenty of topspin on both her forehand and backhand, and can hit in all directions comfortably. She also uses the backhand slice quite often, as a way of varying the pattern of a rally.\nRaina is comfortable with volleying, and approaches the net whenever she gets her opponent running or out of position. She doesn't use the drop shot or lob too frequently, but brings them out as a surprise tactic.\nRaina's biggest strength is her baseline consistency. She can stay toe-to-toe with most players from the back of the court, and can get a majority of shots back in play.\nRaina has a solid first serve, but it is her second serve that gives her an advantage at the start of a point. She can hit a good kick serve, which opens up the court for an easy putaway.\nRaina also has a good return of serve, and is capable of neutralizing most big serves by sending them back with precision. She is also quite efficient at the net, and can take the attack to the opponent on fast courts with her purposeful volleys.\nRaina's biggest weakness is the lack of firepower on her groundstrokes. She can't match the raw muscle strength of the top players, and so is frequently in danger of getting blown off the court. Recently, she has been moving a lot better on the court as well.\n\n==Sponsorship and equipment==\nIn her junior years, Raina was helped by [[Dishman Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals]] to participate in overseas junior tournaments. Since then, she has been supported by [[Bharat Forge]] and Lakshya. Most recently, Raina has signed sponsorship deals with the Sports Authority of Gujarat and [[Yonex]], and she is officially employed with [[ONGC]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Game Changers\n|last=Swamy\n|first=Narain\n|date=2 September 2015\n|access-date=15 March 2016\n|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31806&articlexml=GAME-CHANGERS-02092015025015\n}}</ref> Hence, Raina uses [[Yonex]] racquets and clothing. [[Adani Group]] is her current supporter.\n\nIn 2013, Raina met [[Narendra Modi]], India's then-future prime minister, and officially was recognised under the Shaktidhoot scheme and hence became a part of India's goal of reaching Olympic podiums.\n\n==WTA 125K series finals==\n===Doubles: 1 (1 title)===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Result\n!class=\"unsortable\"|W\u2013L\n!{{ns}}Date{{ns}}\n!Tournament\n!Surface\n!Partner\n!Opponents\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win\n| <small>1\u20130</small>\n| [[2018 OEC Taipei WTA Challenger \u2013 Doubles|{{dts|Nov 2018}}]]\n| bgcolor=silver|[[Taipei Open|WTA Taipei]], Taiwan\n| Carpet\n| {{flagicon|IND}} [[Karman Thandi]]\n| {{flagicon|RUS}} [[Olga Doroshina]] <br/> {{flagicon|RUS}} [[Natela Dzalamidze]]\n| 6\u20133, 5\u20137, [12\u201312], ret.\n|}\n\n==ITF circuit finals==\n===Singles: 21 (11 titles, 10 runner\u2013ups)===\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n!

In April 2018, she entered the top 200 singles rankings for the first time, becoming only the fifth player representing India to achieve this feat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Srinivasan|first1=Kamesh|title=Ankita Raina in top-200|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ankita-in-top-200/article23484503.ece|accessdate=18 April 2018|date=9 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ankita Raina becomes only third Indian woman tennis player to break into top 200 singles rankings|url=https://www.firstpost.com/sports/ankita-raina-becomes-only-third-indian-woman-tennis-player-to-break-into-top-200-singles-rankings-4425623.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|agency=PTI|date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Raina has also won gold medals in the women's singles and mixed-doubles events at the [[2016 South Asian Games]], and won a bronze medal in singles at the [[Tennis at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]].\n\nPlaying for [[India Fed Cup team|India]] at the [[Fed Cup]], Raina has a win-loss record of 18\u201314.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcup.com/en/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100124146|title=Ankita Raina |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> She has notable wins over [[Zhu Lin (tennis)|Zhu Lin]] (CHN) and [[Yulia Putintseva]] (KAZ), both at the [[2018 Fed Cup]].\n\n==Personal life==\nRaina was born in the western Indian state of [[Gujarat]] to a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family. Her family hails from the town of [[Tral]] in [[Pulwama|Pulwama district]], [[Kashmir]]. Raina is fluent in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and English. Raina briefly studied at [[Brihan Maharashtra]].\n\nAt the national events, Raina has represented her home state [[Gujarat]]. Her idols growing up were [[Roger Federer]], [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Sania Mirza]].\n\nRaina trains at the [[Hemant Bendrey Tennis Academy]] at the [[Deccan Gymkhana#PYC Hindu Gymkhana|PYC Hindu Gymkhana]] in [[Pune]], and is coached by Hemant Bendrey.<ref>[https://celebrityhubspot.com/ankita-raina-biography-profile-records-awards-achievement/ Ankita Raina - Bio]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:2018 Roland Garros Qualifying Tournament - 55 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Raina playing in the qualifying competition of the [[2018 French Open]] \u2013 her first Grand Slam tournament.]]\nRaina started playing tennis at the age of five. Following a promising junior career, Raina made her first professional appearance in 2009, at a small ITF tournament in Mumbai. In 2010, she continued to participate in local ITF events with limited success. Raina's 2011 season saw her advance to three ITF circuit finals in doubles, winning one with countrywoman Aishwarya Agrawal. In 2012, she won her first professional singles title in New Delhi and won three more in doubles. This was followed by a few years of mediocre results on the [[ITF Women's Circuit]].\n\nRaina won two matches at the [[2017 Mumbai Open]], advancing to the biggest quarterfinal of her career. This would turn out to be her breakthrough tournament. In April 2018, she reached a ranking of world No. 181 after winning a $25K ITF title, becoming the fifth Indian national to crack to the top-200 ladies singles rankings, following [[Nirupama Sanjeev]], [[Sania Mirza]], [[Shikha Uberoi]], and [[Sunitha Rao]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Kamesh |title=Ankita Raina in top-200 |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ankita-in-top-200/article23484503.ece |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, Ankita won the bronze medal in the [[2018 Asian Games|Asian Games]] at Jakarta, Indonesia in singles event. Raina and [[Sania Mirza]] are the only players representing India to have won a singles medal at the Asian Games.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ankita Raina settles for bronze at Asian Games |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ankita-raina-settles-for-bronze-at-asian-games/article24758802.ece |accessdate=23 August 2018 |agency=PTI |date=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2019 Kunming Open]], Raina got her first top-100 win, defeating [[Samantha Stosur]], former [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] champion and top 10 player, scoring the biggest win of her career. In October 2019, Raina entered the top 150 doubles rankings for the first time, after reaching the finals of the [[2019 Suzhou Ladies Open]] with partner [[Rosalie van der Hoek]]. She bettered this feat by winning two back-to-back ITF titles in [[Nonthaburi]] alongside [[Bibiane Schoofs]]; followed by reaching her first [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] semifinal at the [[2020 Thailand Open]] alongside Rosalie. This gave Raina a new career-high raking of No. 123 in doubles.\n\n==Playing style==\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nRaina is a steady baseliner who primarily relies on her speed and counterpunching abilities to outlast her opponents.\nShe hits with plenty of topspin on both her forehand and backhand, and can hit in all directions comfortably. She also uses the backhand slice quite often, as a way of varying the pattern of a rally.\nRaina is comfortable with volleying, and approaches the net whenever she gets her opponent running or out of position. She doesn't use the drop shot or lob too frequently, but brings them out as a surprise tactic.\nRaina's biggest strength is her baseline consistency. She can stay toe-to-toe with most players from the back of the court, and can get a majority of shots back in play.\nRaina has a solid first serve, but it is her second serve that gives her an advantage at the start of a point. She can hit a good kick serve, which opens up the court for an easy putaway.\nRaina also has a good return of serve, and is capable of neutralizing most big serves by sending them back with precision. She is also quite efficient at the net, and can take the attack to the opponent on fast courts with her purposeful volleys.\nRaina's biggest weakness is the lack of firepower on her groundstrokes. She can't match the raw muscle strength of the top players, and so is frequently in danger of getting blown off the court. Recently, she was been moving a lot better on the court as well.\n\n==Sponsorship and equipment==\nIn her junior years, Raina was helped by [[Dishman Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals]] to participate in overseas junior tournaments. Since then, she has been supported by [[Bharat Forge]] and Lakshya. Most recently, Raina has signed sponsorship deals with the Sports Authority of Gujarat and [[Yonex]], and she is officially employed with [[ONGC]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Game Changers\n|last=Swamy\n|first=Narain\n|date=2 September 2015\n|access-date=15 March 2016\n|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31806&articlexml=GAME-CHANGERS-02092015025015\n}}</ref> Hence, Raina uses [[Yonex]] racquets and clothing. [[Adani Group]] is her current supporter.\n\nIn 2013, Raina met [[Narendra Modi]], India's then-future prime minister, and officially was recognised under the Shaktidhoot scheme and hence became a part of India's goal of reaching Olympic podiums.\n\n==WTA 125K series finals==\n===Doubles: 1 (1 title)===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Result\n!class=\"unsortable\"|W\u2013L\n!{{ns}}Date{{ns}}\n!Tournament\n!Surface\n!Partner\n!Opponents\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win\n| <small>1\u20130</small>\n| [[2018 OEC Taipei WTA Challenger \u2013 Doubles|{{dts|Nov 2018}}]]\n| bgcolor=silver|[[Taipei Open|WTA Taipei]], Taiwan\n| Carpet\n| {{flagicon|IND}} [[Karman Thandi]]\n| {{flagicon|RUS}} [[Olga Doroshina]] <br/> {{flagicon|RUS}} [[Natela Dzalamidze]]\n| 6\u20133, 5\u20137, [12\u201312], ret.\n|}\n\n==ITF circuit finals==\n===Singles: 21 (11 titles, 10 runner\u2013ups)===\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n!

It ended the long period of [[Roman Egypt|Roman and Byzantine rule]] in Egypt. Byzantine rule in the country had been shaken, as Egypt had been [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|conquered and occupied for a decade]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 618\u2013629, before being recovered by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. The Caliphate took advantage of the Byzantines' exhaustion and captured Egypt ten years after its reconquest by Heraclius.\n\nDuring the mid-630s, Byzantium had already lost the [[Levant]] and its [[Ghassanid]] allies in Arabia to the Caliphate. The loss of the prosperous province of Egypt and the defeat of the Byzantine armies severely weakened the empire, resulting in further territorial losses in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"Haykalch18\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>\n\n==Rashidun invasion of Egypt==\n===Crossing Egyptian border===\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pyramids of Giza]]\nIn December 639, [['Amr ibn al-'As]] left for Egypt with a force of 4,000 troops. Most of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ak, but [[Al-Kindi]] mentioned that one third of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of Ghafik. The Arab soldiers were also joined by some Roman and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] converts to Islam. However, 'Umar, the Muslim caliph, reconsidered his orders to Amr and considered it foolhardy to expect to conquer such a large country as Egypt with a mere 4,000 soldiers. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to 'Amr ordering him to come back.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref>\n\nThe messenger, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr, caught up with Amr at [[Rafah]], a little short of the Egyptian frontier. Guessing what might be in the letter, 'Amr ordered the army to quicken its pace. Turning to 'Uqbah, 'Amr said that he would receive the caliph's letter from him when the army had halted after the day's journey. 'Uqbah, unaware of the contents of the letter, agreed and marched along with the army. The army halted for the night at Shajratein, a little valley near the city of [[El Arish]], which 'Amr knew to be beyond the Egyptian border.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\">Al-Maqrizi, Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar.</ref> 'Amr then received and read 'Umar's letter and went on to consult his companions as to the course of action to be adopted. The unanimous view was that as they had received the letter on Egyptian soil, they had permission to proceed.\n\nWhen 'Umar received the reply, he decided to watch further developments and to start concentrating fresh forces at Madinah that could be dispatched to Egypt as reinforcements. On [[Eid al-Adha]], the Muslim army marched from Shajratein to [[El Arish]],<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> a small town lacking a garrison. The town put up no resistance, and the citizens offered allegiance on the usual terms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Muslim soldiers celebrated the Eid festival there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Conquest of Pelusium and Belbeis===\nIn of December 639 or early January 640, the Muslim army reached [[Pelusium]], a garrison city considered to be the eastern gateway to Egypt at the time. The siege of the town dragged on for two months. In February 640, an assault group, led by the prominent Huzaifah ibn Wala, successfully captured the fort and city.<ref>Al-Kamil, pp. 451\u2013452</ref><ref>Al-Gawzi, Al-Montazim, pp. 532\u2013534</ref><ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], History of the Kings, p. 862</ref><ref>[[Abu Salih the Armenian]], ''The churches and monasteries of Egypt and some neighbouring countries'', tr.

[[Belbeis]] was the first place in Egypt that the Byzantines showed some measure of resistance towards the Arabs. Two Christian monks, accompanied by Cyrus of Alexandria and the famous Roman general Aretion, came out to negotiate with [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Aretion had been the Byzantine governor of [[Jerusalem]] and had fled to Egypt when the city fell to the Muslims. 'Amr gave them three options: convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]], or fight. They requested three days to reflect and then, according to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], requested two extra days.\n\nAt the end of the five days, the two monks and the general decided to reject Islam and the jizya and fight the Muslims, thus disobeying Cyrus, who wanted to surrender and pay jizya. Cyrus left for the [[Babylon Fortress]]. The battle resulted in a Muslim victory during which Aretion was killed. 'Amr ibn al-'As subsequently attempted to convince the native Egyptians to aid the Arabs and surrender the city, based on the kinship between Egyptians and Arabs via [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].<ref name=\"Butler216\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=216}}</ref> When the Egyptians refused, the siege resumed until the city fell around the end of March 640.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Now, the Arabs were only one day away from the head of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]].\n\n===Siege of Babylon===\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim conquest of Egypt.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of the Muslims' invasion of Egypt]]\nAmr had assumed that Egypt would be a pushover but was quickly proven wrong. Even at the outposts of Pelusium and Belbeis, the Muslims had met stiff resistance, with sieges of two and one months, respectively. As Babylon, near what is now Cairo, was a larger and more important city, resistance on a larger scale was expected.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> The Muslims arrived at Babylon some time in May 640.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902}}</ref>\n\nBabylon was a fortified city, and the Romans had indeed prepared it for a siege. Outside the city, a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] had been dug, and a large force was positioned in the area between the ditch and the city walls. The Muslims besieged the fort, a massive structure {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high with walls more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick and studded with numerous [[tower]]s and [[bastion]]s and a force of some 4,000 men. Early Muslim sources place the strength of the Byzantine force in Babylon at about six times the strength of the Muslim force. For the next two months, fighting remained inconclusive, with the Byzantines repulsing every Muslim assault.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nLater the same month, 'Amr sent a detachment to raid the city of [[Fayoum]]. The Byzantines had anticipated that and so had strongly guarded the roads that led to the city and had fortified their garrison in the nearby town of [[Lahun]]. When the Muslims realised that Fayoum was too strong for them to take, they headed towards the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]], where they looted all the cattle and animals that they could. They subsequently headed to [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Per-Medjed), which was defeated. The Arabs then returned to [[Lower Egypt]] down the [[River Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler254-255\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|pp=254\u2013255}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements from Madinah====\nIn July, 'Amr wrote to 'Umar requesting reinforcements, but before the letter reached him, the caliph had already dispatched 4,000 men, mostly veterans of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syrian campaigns]], to bolster Amr's strength. Even with the reinforcements, 'Amr was unsuccessful and so, by August, 'Umar had assembled another 4,000-strong force, consisting of four columns, each of 1,000 elite men. [[Zubair ibn al-Awam]], a renowned warrior and commander, veteran of the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and once a part of [[Khalid ibn Walid]]'s elite [[mobile guard]], was appointed the supreme commander of the army.\n\n'Umar had also offered Zubair the chief command and governorship of Egypt, but Zubair had declined. The column commanders included [[Miqdad bin Al-Aswad|Miqdad ibn al-Aswad]], [[Ubaida bin As-Samit|Ubaidah ibn as-Samit]] and [[Kharija bin Huzafa|Kharijah ibn Huzaifah]]. The reinforcements arrived at Babylon sometime in September 640, bringing the total strength of the Muslim force to 12,000, still quite modest.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>\n\n====Battle of Heliopolis====\n{{main|Battle of Heliopolis}}\nThe Muslim army reached [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], 15 km (10 mi) from Babylon,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> in July 640.<ref>Raymond, Andre, ''Cairo'', transl. Willard Wood, (Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 10.</ref> The city boasted the Sun Temple of the [[Pharaohs]] and grandiose monuments and learning institutions.<ref name=\"Butler258\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=258}}</ref> There was the danger that forces from Heliopolis could attack the Muslims from the flank while they were engaged with the Roman army at Babylon.\n\nThere was a cavalry clash near the current neighbourhood of [[Abbaseya]]. The engagement was not decisive, but it resulted in the occupation of the fortress located between the current neighborhoods of Abdyn and Azbakeya. The defeated Byzantine soldiers retreated to either the Babylon Fortress or the fortress of Niki\u00fb.<ref name=\"Butler263\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=263}}</ref> Zubair and some of his handpicked soldiers scaled the Heliopolis city wall at an unguarded point and, after overpowering the guards, opened the gates for the army to enter the city. After the capture of Heliopolis, 'Amr and Zubair returned to Babylon.\n\n====Conquering of Fayoum and Babylon====\n{{main article|Siege of Babylon Fortress}}\nWhen news of the Muslims' victory at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] reached Fayoum, its Byzantine garrison, under the command of Domentianus, evacuated the city during the night and fled to Abuit and then down the [[Nile]] to Nikiu without informing the people of Fayoum and Abuit that they were abandoning their cities to the enemy. When news reached 'Amr, he sent troops across the [[Nile]] to invade Fayoum and Abuit, capturing the entire province of Fayoum without any resistance.<ref name=\"Butler264\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=264}}</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine garrison at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]] had grown bolder than ever before and had begun to sally forth across the ditch but with little success. The stalemate was broken when the Muslim commanders devised an ingenious strategy, inflicting heavy casualties on the Byzantine forces by encircling them from three sides during one of their sallies. The Byzantines were able to retreat back to the fort, but were left too weak for any further offensive action, forcing them to negotiate. The Byzantine general, Theodorus, shifted his headquarters to the Isle of Rauda, and Cyrus of Alexandria, popularly known as ''Muqawqis'' in Muslim history, entered into fruitless negotiations with the Muslims.\n\nEmissaries were also exchanged between Theodorus and 'Amr, leading to 'Amr meeting Theodorus in person. Then, with negotiations stalled, during the night of 20 December, a company of handpicked warriors, led by Zubair, managed to scale the wall, kill the guards, and open the gates for the Muslim army to enter. The city was captured by the Muslims the following morning with tactics similar to those that had been used by Khalid ibn Walid at Damascus. However, Theodorus and his army managed to slip away to the island of Rauda during the night.<ref name=\"Haykalch21\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 21}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Thebaid (Southeastern Egypt)===\nOn 22 December, Cyrus of Alexandria entered a treaty with the Muslims,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 22}}</ref> recognizing Muslim sovereignty over the whole of Egypt and effectively over [[Thebaid]], and agreeing to pay Jizya at the rate of 2 diners per male adult.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The treaty was subject to the approval of the emperor Heraclius, but Cyrus stipulated that even if the emperor repudiated the treaty, he and the [[Copts]], of whom he was the High Priest, would honour its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Omar (634-644)\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006</ref> Cyrus asked Heraclius to ratify the treaty and offered an argument in support. 'Amr submitted a detailed report to Umar recommending ratification.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He desired that as soon as the reactions of Heraclius were known, he should be informed so that further necessary instructions could be issued promptly.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nHeraclius rejected the treaty, stripping Cyrus of the viceroyship although he remained head of the Coptic Church. Heraclius sent strict orders to the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine forces in Egypt that the Muslims should be driven out of Egypt. Cyrus, in reporting Heraclius' response to 'Amr, reassured him that the Copts would honor the treaty regardless. It is recorded that Cyrus requested three favours from the Muslims:\n#Do not break your treaty with the Copts.\n#If the Byzantines after the repudiation ask for peace, do not make peace with them, but treat them as captives and slaves; and\n#When I am dead, allow me to be buried in the [[Church (building)|Church]] of [[John the Merciful|St. John]] at Alexandria.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Haykalch23\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 23}}</ref> \n\nAs the Copts were native Egyptians, the treaty provided a strategic advantage to the Muslims. 'Umar, upon learning of these developments, made preparations for a pre-emptive strike against the Byzantines in Alexandria.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===March to Alexandria===\n[[File:Alexandrie 112004 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ancient Roman theaters in Alexandria]]\nThe Byzantine commanders, knowing full well that the Muslims' next target was Alexandria, set out to repel the Muslims through continued sallies from the fort or, at least, to exhaust them and erode their morale in a campaign of attrition.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> In February 641, 'Amr set off for Alexandria from Babylon with his army, encountering defending regiments all along the route. On the third day of their marchn the Muslims' advance guard encountered a Byzantine detachment at Tarnut on the west bank of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The Byzantines failed to inflict heavy losses but were able to delay the advance by a full day. The Muslim commanders decided to halt the main army at Tarnut and send an advance guard of cavalry forward to clear the path.\n\nNow {{convert|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Tarnut, the Byzantine detachment that had withdrawn from Tarnut the day before joined another that was already at Shareek, and both attacked and routed the Muslim cavalry. The next day, before the Byzantines could annihilate the Muslim advance guard completely, the main Muslim army arrived, prompting the Byzantines to withdraw. The following day, the whole army marched forward without an advance guard. The Muslims reached Sulteis, where they encountered another Byzantine detachment. Hard fighting followed, but the Byzantine resistance soon broke down and they withdrew to Alexandria.\n\nThe Muslims halted at Sulteis for a day, still two days' march from Alexandria. After another day's march, the Muslim forces arrived at Kirayun, {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. There, the Muslim advance to Alexandria was blocked by a Byzantine force about 20,000 strong. The resulting action remained indecisive for ten days.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> However, on the tenth day, the Muslims launched a vigorous assault, forcing the defeated Byzantines to retreat to Alexandria. With the way to Alexandria clear, the Muslims reached the capital's outskirts in March.\n\n===Conquest of Alexandria and fall of Egypt===\n{{Main|Siege of Alexandria (641)}}\nThe Muslims laid siege to Alexandria in March 641.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The city was heavily fortified and provisioned: there were walls within walls and forts within forts. The city also had direct access to the sea by which men and supplies from [[Constantinople]] could come at any time.\n\nAs 'Amr surveyed the military situation, he felt that the conquest of Alexandria would be difficult.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria and were determined to offer stiff resistance to the Muslims. They mounted catapults on the walls of the city, and the engines effectively pounded the Muslims with boulders, prompting 'Amr to withdraw out of range. The ensuing battle see-sawed:<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> when the Muslims approached the city, they were pelted with missiles, and, when the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by the Muslims.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, collected a large army at Constantinople, intending to lead it personally to Alexandria. However, before he could finalize the arrangements, he died. The troops mustered at Constantinople dispersed, and no help came to Alexandria, which further demoralied the defenders. The siege dragged on for six months, and in [[Madinah]], 'Umar, got impatient. In a letter addressed to 'Amr, the caliph, concerned at the inordinate delay, appointed 'Ubaidah as field commander to assault the fort. 'Ubaidah's assault was successful, and [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Alexandria was captured]] by the Muslims in September. Thousands of Byzantine soldiers were killed or taken captive, and others managed to flee to Constantinople on ships that had been anchored in the port. Some wealthy traders also left.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nOn behalf of the Egyptians, Cyrus of Alexandria sued for peace, and his request was granted. After the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr is reported{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to have written to 'Umar, \"We have conquered Alexandria. In this city there are 4,000 palaces, 400 places of entertainment, and untold wealth.\"\n\nOn the twentieth of Maskaram (approximately September 18 according to the Julian calendar), the Byzantine general, Theodorus, and all of his troops proceeded to the island of [[Cyprus]], abandoning [[Alexandria]] to 'Amr. The conquest represented a huge loss of food and money to Byzantium and, coupled with the conquest of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the later [[Umayyad invasion of North Africa|invasion of the Exarchate of Africa]], meant that the Mediterranean, long referred to as the \"Roman lake\", was now contested between the [[Muslim Caliphate]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The latter, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to [[Anatolia]], while the [[walls of Constantinople]] would withstand two great Muslim sieges, saving the Byzantines from the fate of the Persian Empire.<ref>Kaegli, Walter. Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium.</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Nubia==\nIn the summer of 642, 'Amr ibn al-'As sent an expedition to the Christian kingdom of [[Nubia]], which bordered Egypt to the south, under the command of his cousin 'Uqbah ibn Nafi as a pre-emptive raid to announce the arrival of new rulers in Egypt.<ref>Akram, A.I., ''Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-597712-7}}</ref> 'Uqbah ibn Nafi, who later made a great name for himself as the conqueror of Africa and led his horse to the Atlantic, had an unhappy experience in Nubia. No pitched battle was fought, but there were only [[skirmishes]] and haphazard engagements, the type of warfare in which the Nubians excelled. They were skilful archers and subjected the Muslims to a merciless barrage of arrows, resulting in 250 Muslims losing their eyes in the engagement.\n\nThe Nubian cavalry displayed remarkable speed,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> even more so than the Muslim cavalry. The Nubians would strike hard and then vanish before the Muslims could recover and counterattack. The hit-and-run raids took their toll on the Muslim expedition. 'Uqbah reported that to 'Amr,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> who ordered 'Uqbah to withdraw from Nubia, terminating the expedition.\n\n==Conquest of North Africa==\nAfter the expedition to Nubia, 'Amr opted to secure the western borders of Egypt and clear the regions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] of Byzantine influence. In September 642, 'Amr led his troops west. After one month of marching the Muslim forces reached the cities of the [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]]. From Burqa, he sent 'Uqbah bin Nafi at the head of a column to undertake a campaign against Fezzan, in present-day northwestern [[Libya]]. 'Uqbah marched to Zaweela, the capital; the entire district then submitted to the Muslims without resistance. 'Uqbah then returned to [[Brak, Libya|Burqa]]. Soon after the Muslim army marched westward from there, arriving at [[Tripoli]] in the spring of 643. The city fell after a siege of one month. From there, 'Amr sent a detachment to [[Sabratha]], 65 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) away. The city put up feeble resistance, and soon surrendered and agreed to pay Jizya. From Tripoli, 'Amr is reported{{whom|date=May 2019}} to have reported to the caliph, \"We have conquered Burqa, Tripoli and Sabratha. The way to the west is clear, and if the Commander of the Faithful wishes to conquer more lands, we could do so with the grace of God.\"\n\n'Umar, whose armies were already engaged in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]], did not want to commit his forces further in North Africa while Muslim rule in Egypt was still insecure. The caliph accordingly ordered 'Amr to consolidate the Muslims' position in Egypt and that there should be no further campaigning. 'Amr obeyed, abandoning Tripoli and Burqa and returning to [[Fustat]] towards the close of 643.<ref name=\"Haykalch24\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 24}}</ref>\n\n==Taxation under Muslim rule==\nThose who refused to convert to Islam were taxed in the form of money and food for the occupying troops, and in exchange, the taxpayers were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. The system was a new institution, a religious mandate, but carried over from previous [[poll tax]] systems in the ancient Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Indeed, the Egyptians had been subject to it, as non-Romans, during Roman rule before the [[Christianization|adoption of Christianity]] by the Roman state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Then, all non-Christian subjects of the [[Roman Empire]] had to pay it, including non-Christian Egyptians.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Persians also had a similar poll tax system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Egypt under Muslim rule==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Rashidun Empire at its peak under third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman- 654 {{legend|#009900|Strongholds of Rashidun Caliphate}}]]\nMuslims gained control over Egypt by  a variety of factors, including internal Byzantine politics, religious zeal and the difficulty of maintaining a large empire. The Byzantines attempted to regain Alexandria, but it was retaken by 'Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repelled. No serious effort was then made by the Byzantines to regain possession of Egypt.\n\nIn ''The Great Arab Conquests'', Hugh Kennedy writes that Cyrus, the Roman governor, had exiled the Coptic patriarch, [[Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria|Benjamin]]. When 'Amr occupied Alexandria, a Coptic nobleman (''duqs'') called Sanutius persuaded him to send out a proclamation of safe conduct for Benjamin and an invitation to return to Alexandria. When Benjamin arrived, after 13 years in hiding, Amr treated him with respect. Benjamin was then instructed by the governor to resume control over the [[Coptic Church]]. He arranged for the restoration of the monasteries in the [[Wadi Natrun]], which had been ruined by the [[Chalcedonean Christians]]; four of them still survive as functioning monasteries.<ref name=\"Kennedy164\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn Amr's return, the Egyptian population also worked with him.<ref name=\"Kennedy167\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=167}}</ref> Kennedy wrote, \"The pious biographer of Coptic patriarch Benjamin presents us with the striking image of the patriarch prayed for the success of the Muslim commander Amr against the Christians of the Cyrenaica. Benjamin survived for almost twenty years after the fall of Egypt to the Muslims, dying of full years and honour in 661. His body was laid to rest in the [[monastery of St Macarius]], where he is still venerated as a saint. There can be no doubt that he played a major role in the survival of the Coptic Church\".<ref name=\"Kennedy164\"/> Benjamin also prayed for 'Amr when he attempted to take Libya.<ref name=\"Kennedy163\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=163}}</ref>\n\nKennedy also wrote, \"Even more striking is the verdict of John of Nikiu. John was no admirer of Muslim government and was fierce in his denunciation, but he says of Amr: 'He extracted the taxes which had been determined upon but he took none of the property of the churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.... Of all the early Muslim conquests, that of Egypt was the swiftest and most complete. Within a space of two years the country had come entirely under Arab rule. Even more remarkably, it has remained under Muslim rule ever since. Seldom in history can so massive a political change have happened so swiftly and been so long lasting.\"<ref name=\"Kennedy165\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=165}}</ref>\n\n[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] then used Egypt as a launch pad to move across North Africa, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"Kennedy212\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=212}}</ref> Kennedy wrote that when Uqba reached the Atlantic, he is said to have ridden his horse into the sea until the water was below his chest, and then shouted, 'O Lord, if the sea did not stop me, I would go through lands like Alexander the Great, defending your faith'. Kennedy writes further that the image of a warrior whose conquest in the name of God was stopped only by the ocean remains important in the history of the conquests.<ref name=\"Kennedy214\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Fustat, the new capital===\nDuring the Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt. When Alexandria was captured by the Muslims, the houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by the Muslims, who were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, \"the queen of cities\". 'Amr wanted Alexandria to remain the capital of Muslim Egypt.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> He wrote to 'Umar to propose that but 'Umar refused on the basis that Alexandria was a [[coast|maritime]] city, and there would always be a danger that the [[Byzantine Navy]] would attack.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He suggested instead for the capital would be established at a central location further inland, where no mass of water separated it from Arabia.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The treaty with Cyrus of Alexandria was followed, and the wealth of the Egyptians in Alexandria was spared and that of Romans and [[Greeks]] was taken as booty. Greek citizens were given a choice: return to Greek territories safely without their wealth or stay in Alexandria and pay [[Jizya]]. Some chose to stay, and others went to Byzantine lands.\n\n'Amr next proceeded to choose a suitable site for the capital of Egypt, eventually settling on the site where he had pitched his tent at the time of the battle of Babylon, about 400 m (500 yd) northeast of the fort. It is reported that after the battle was over and the army was about to march to Alexandria, the men began to pull down the tent and pack it for the journey, and it was found that a [[dove]] had nested on top of the tent and laid eggs. 'Amr ordered that the tent be left standing where it was, where it remained after the army departed. 'Amr took the unusual episode as a sign from Heaven and decided \"where the dove laid its nest, let the people build their city\".\n\nAs 'Amr's tent was to be the focal point of the city, the city was called [[Fustat]], meaning in Arabic \"the tent\". The first structure to be built was the [[mosque]] that later became famous as [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As]].<ref name=\"tertullian.org\">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm</ref> In the course of time, Fustat extended to include the old town of Babylon to the west, becoming the bustling commercial centre of Egypt.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\n==='Umar's reforms===\nTo consolidate his rule in Egypt, 'Umar imposed the jizya on Egyptians. During later [[Umayyad]] rule, higher taxes would be levied. With 'Umar's permission, 'Amr decided to build a [[canal]] to join the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]] to open new markets for Egyptian merchants and an easy route to Arabia and [[Iraq]]. The project was presented to 'Umar, who approved it. A canal was dug and, within a few months, was opened for merchants. It was named \"Nahar Amir ul-Mu'mineen\" (''the canal of the Commander of the Faithful''), after 'Umar's title.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nAmr proposed to dig another canal joining the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> but Umar rejected the plan on the basis that it would open a way for the Byzantine Navy to enter the Red Sea and pose a threat to [[Medina]] itself.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> The plan would not come to fruition until the [[Suez Canal]] was completed 1300 years later. Each year, the caliph earmarked a large amount of jizya, to be used on the building and repairing of canals and bridges.<ref name=\"Haykalch25\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 25}}</ref> The Arabs remained in control of the country from this point until 1250, when it fell under the control of the [[Mamluks.|Mamelukes]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aegyptus (Roman province)]]\n*[[Muslim conquests]]\n*[[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]\n*[[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]]\n*[[Spread of Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Betts|first=Robert B.|title=Christians in the Arab East: A Political Study|year=1978|edition=2nd rev.|location=Athens|publisher=Lycabettus Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHstAQAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Alfred |title=The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion |url=https://archive.org/details/arabconquestofeg00butl |year=1902 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Charles|first=Robert H.|authorlink=Robert Charles (scholar)|title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu: Translated from Zotenberg's Ethiopic Text|year=2007|origyear=1916|location=Merchantville, NJ|publisher=Evolution Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZ-DOr77OQC}}\n* {{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |author-link=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=Al Farooq, Umar |year=1944 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Hugh |title=The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in |url=https://archive.org/details/greatarabconques00kenn_0 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81740-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Meyendorff|first=John|author-link=John Meyendorff|year=1989|title=Imperial unity and Christian divisions: The Church 450-680 A.D.|series=The Church in history|volume=2|location=Crestwood, NY|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6J_YAAAAMAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Ostrogorsky|first=George|authorlink=George Ostrogorsky|year=1956|title=History of the Byzantine State|location=Oxford|publisher=Basil Blackwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bt0_AAAAYAAJ}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Gibbon |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519211753/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter51.html |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=51}}\n* {{citation |last=Nikiou |first=Bishop John |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm |title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu |chapter=CXVI\u2013CXXI}}\n\n{{Egypt topics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muslim Conquest Of Egypt}}\n[[Category:640s conflicts]]\n[[Category:7th century in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Islamization of Egypt}}\n{{short description|Invasion of Roman Egypt, then part of the Byzantine Empire, by the Rashidun Caliphate between 639 and 646}}\n{{Cleanup|date=January 2012}}\n{{story|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| image      = File:Roman Theater in the city of Alexandria .

It ended the long period of [[Roman Egypt|Roman and Byzantine rule]] in Egypt. Byzantine rule in the country had been shaken, as Egypt had been [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|conquered and occupied for a decade]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 618\u2013629, before being recovered by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. The Caliphate took advantage of the Byzantines' exhaustion and captured Egypt ten years after its reconquest by Heraclius.\n\nDuring the mid-630s, Byzantium had already lost the [[Levant]] and its [[Ghassanid]] allies in Arabia to the Caliphate. The loss of the prosperous province of Egypt and the defeat of the Byzantine armies severely weakened the empire, resulting in further territorial losses in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"Haykalch18\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>\n\n==Rashidun invasion of Egypt==\n===Crossing Egyptian border===\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pyramids of Giza]]\nIn December 639, [['Amr ibn al-'As]] left for Egypt with a force of 4,000 troops. Most of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ak, but [[Al-Kindi]] mentioned that one third of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of Ghafik. The Arab soldiers were also joined by some Roman and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] converts to Islam. However, 'Umar, the Muslim caliph, reconsidered his orders to Amr and considered it foolhardy to expect to conquer such a large country as Egypt with a mere 4,000 soldiers. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to 'Amr ordering him to come back.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref>\n\nThe messenger, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr, caught up with Amr at [[Rafah]], a little short of the Egyptian frontier. Guessing what might be in the letter, 'Amr ordered the army to quicken its pace. Turning to 'Uqbah, 'Amr said that he would receive the caliph's letter from him when the army had halted after the day's journey. 'Uqbah, unaware of the contents of the letter, agreed and marched along with the army. The army halted for the night at Shajratein, a little valley near the city of [[El Arish]], which 'Amr knew to be beyond the Egyptian border.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\">Al-Maqrizi, Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar.</ref> 'Amr then received and read 'Umar's letter and went on to consult his companions as to the course of action to be adopted. The unanimous view was that as they had received the letter on Egyptian soil, they had permission to proceed.\n\nWhen 'Umar received the reply, he decided to watch further developments and to start concentrating fresh forces at Madinah that could be dispatched to Egypt as reinforcements. On [[Eid al-Adha]], the Muslim army marched from Shajratein to [[El Arish]],<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> a small town lacking a garrison. The town put up no resistance, and the citizens offered allegiance on the usual terms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Muslim soldiers celebrated the Eid festival there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Conquest of Pelusium and Belbeis===\nIn of December 639 or early January 640, the Muslim army reached [[Pelusium]], a garrison city considered to be the eastern gateway to Egypt at the time. The siege of the town dragged on for two months. In February 640, an assault group, led by the prominent Huzaifah ibn Wala, successfully captured the fort and city.<ref>Al-Kamil, pp. 451\u2013452</ref><ref>Al-Gawzi, Al-Montazim, pp. 532\u2013534</ref><ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], History of the Kings, p. 862</ref><ref>[[Abu Salih the Armenian]], ''The churches and monasteries of Egypt and some neighbouring countries'', tr.

[[Belbeis]] was the first place in Egypt that the Byzantines showed some measure of resistance towards the Arabs. Two Christian monks, accompanied by Cyrus of Alexandria and the famous Roman general Aretion, came out to negotiate with [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Aretion had been the Byzantine governor of [[Jerusalem]] and had fled to Egypt when the city fell to the Muslims. 'Amr gave them three options: convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]], or fight. They requested three days to reflect and then, according to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], requested two extra days.\n\nAt the end of the five days, the two monks and the general decided to reject Islam and the jizya and fight the Muslims, thus disobeying Cyrus, who wanted to surrender and pay jizya. Cyrus left for the [[Babylon Fortress]]. The battle resulted in a Muslim victory during which Aretion was killed. 'Amr ibn al-'As subsequently attempted to convince the native Egyptians to aid the Arabs and surrender the city, based on the kinship between Egyptians and Arabs via [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].<ref name=\"Butler216\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=216}}</ref> When the Egyptians refused, the siege resumed until the city fell around the end of March 640.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Now, the Arabs were only one day away from the head of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]].\n\n===Siege of Babylon===\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim conquest of Egypt.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of the Muslims' invasion of Egypt]]\nAmr had assumed that Egypt would be a pushover but was quickly proven wrong. Even at the outposts of Pelusium and Belbeis, the Muslims had met stiff resistance, with sieges of two and one months, respectively. As Babylon, near what is now Cairo, was a larger and more important city, resistance on a larger scale was expected.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> The Muslims arrived at Babylon some time in May 640.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902}}</ref>\n\nBabylon was a fortified city, and the Romans had indeed prepared it for a siege. Outside the city, a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] had been dug, and a large force was positioned in the area between the ditch and the city walls. The Muslims besieged the fort, a massive structure {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high with walls more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick and studded with numerous [[tower]]s and [[bastion]]s and a force of some 4,000 men. Early Muslim sources place the strength of the Byzantine force in Babylon at about six times the strength of the Muslim force. For the next two months, fighting remained inconclusive, with the Byzantines repulsing every Muslim assault.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nLater the same month, 'Amr sent a detachment to raid the city of [[Fayoum]]. The Byzantines had anticipated that and so had strongly guarded the roads that led to the city and had fortified their garrison in the nearby town of [[Lahun]]. When the Muslims realised that Fayoum was too strong for them to take, they headed towards the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]], where they looted all the cattle and animals that they could. They subsequently headed to [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Per-Medjed), which was defeated. The Arabs then returned to [[Lower Egypt]] down the [[River Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler254-255\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|pp=254\u2013255}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements from Madinah====\nIn July, 'Amr wrote to 'Umar requesting reinforcements, but before the letter reached him, the caliph had already dispatched 4,000 men, mostly veterans of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syrian campaigns]], to bolster Amr's strength. Even with the reinforcements, 'Amr was unsuccessful and so, by August, 'Umar had assembled another 4,000-strong force, consisting of four columns, each of 1,000 elite men. [[Zubair ibn al-Awam]], a renowned warrior and commander, veteran of the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and once a part of [[Khalid ibn Walid]]'s elite [[mobile guard]], was appointed the supreme commander of the army.\n\n'Umar had also offered Zubair the chief command and governorship of Egypt, but Zubair had declined. The column commanders included [[Miqdad bin Al-Aswad|Miqdad ibn al-Aswad]], [[Ubaida bin As-Samit|Ubaidah ibn as-Samit]] and [[Kharija bin Huzafa|Kharijah ibn Huzaifah]]. The reinforcements arrived at Babylon sometime in September 640, bringing the total strength of the Muslim force to 12,000, still quite modest.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>\n\n====Battle of Heliopolis====\n{{main|Battle of Heliopolis}}\nThe Muslim army reached [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], 15 km (10 mi) from Babylon,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> in July 640.<ref>Raymond, Andre, ''Cairo'', transl. Willard Wood, (Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 10.</ref> The city boasted the Sun Temple of the [[Pharaohs]] and grandiose monuments and learning institutions.<ref name=\"Butler258\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=258}}</ref> There was the danger that forces from Heliopolis could attack the Muslims from the flank while they were engaged with the Roman army at Babylon.\n\nThere was a cavalry clash near the current neighbourhood of [[Abbaseya]]. The engagement was not decisive, but it resulted in the occupation of the fortress located between the current neighborhoods of Abdyn and Azbakeya. The defeated Byzantine soldiers retreated to either the Babylon Fortress or the fortress of Niki\u00fb.<ref name=\"Butler263\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=263}}</ref> Zubair and some of his handpicked soldiers scaled the Heliopolis city wall at an unguarded point and, after overpowering the guards, opened the gates for the army to enter the city. After the capture of Heliopolis, 'Amr and Zubair returned to Babylon.\n\n====Conquering of Fayoum and Babylon====\n{{main article|Siege of Babylon Fortress}}\nWhen news of the Muslims' victory at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] reached Fayoum, its Byzantine garrison, under the command of Domentianus, evacuated the city during the night and fled to Abuit and then down the [[Nile]] to Nikiu without informing the people of Fayoum and Abuit that they were abandoning their cities to the enemy. When news reached 'Amr, he sent troops across the [[Nile]] to invade Fayoum and Abuit, capturing the entire province of Fayoum without any resistance.<ref name=\"Butler264\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=264}}</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine garrison at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]] had grown bolder than ever before and had begun to sally forth across the ditch but with little success. The stalemate was broken when the Muslim commanders devised an ingenious strategy, inflicting heavy casualties on the Byzantine forces by encircling them from three sides during one of their sallies. The Byzantines were able to retreat back to the fort, but were left too weak for any further offensive action, forcing them to negotiate. The Byzantine general, Theodorus, shifted his headquarters to the Isle of Rauda, and Cyrus of Alexandria, popularly known as ''Muqawqis'' in Muslim history, entered into fruitless negotiations with the Muslims.\n\nEmissaries were also exchanged between Theodorus and 'Amr, leading to 'Amr meeting Theodorus in person. Then, with negotiations stalled, during the night of 20 December, a company of handpicked warriors, led by Zubair, managed to scale the wall, kill the guards, and open the gates for the Muslim army to enter. The city was captured by the Muslims the following morning with tactics similar to those that had been used by Khalid ibn Walid at Damascus. However, Theodorus and his army managed to slip away to the island of Rauda during the night.<ref name=\"Haykalch21\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 21}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Thebaid (Southeastern Egypt)===\nOn 22 December, Cyrus of Alexandria entered a treaty with the Muslims,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 22}}</ref> recognizing Muslim sovereignty over the whole of Egypt and effectively over [[Thebaid]], and agreeing to pay Jizya at the rate of 2 diners per male adult.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The treaty was subject to the approval of the emperor Heraclius, but Cyrus stipulated that even if the emperor repudiated the treaty, he and the [[Copts]], of whom he was the High Priest, would honour its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Omar (634-644)\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006</ref> Cyrus asked Heraclius to ratify the treaty and offered an argument in support. 'Amr submitted a detailed report to Umar recommending ratification.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He desired that as soon as the reactions of Heraclius were known, he should be informed so that further necessary instructions could be issued promptly.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nHeraclius rejected the treaty, stripping Cyrus of the viceroyship although he remained head of the Coptic Church. Heraclius sent strict orders to the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine forces in Egypt that the Muslims should be driven out of Egypt. Cyrus, in reporting Heraclius' response to 'Amr, reassured him that the Copts would honor the treaty regardless. It is recorded that Cyrus requested three favours from the Muslims:\n#Do not break your treaty with the Copts.\n#If the Byzantines after the repudiation ask for peace, do not make peace with them, but treat them as captives and slaves; and\n#When I am dead, allow me to be buried in the [[Church (building)|Church]] of [[John the Merciful|St. John]] at Alexandria.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Haykalch23\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 23}}</ref> \n\nAs the Copts were native Egyptians, the treaty provided a strategic advantage to the Muslims. 'Umar, upon learning of these developments, made preparations for a pre-emptive strike against the Byzantines in Alexandria.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===March to Alexandria===\n[[File:Alexandrie 112004 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ancient Roman theaters in Alexandria]]\nThe Byzantine commanders, knowing full well that the Muslims' next target was Alexandria, set out to repel the Muslims through continued sallies from the fort or, at least, to exhaust them and erode their morale in a campaign of attrition.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> In February 641, 'Amr set off for Alexandria from Babylon with his army, encountering defending regiments all along the route. On the third day of their marchn the Muslims' advance guard encountered a Byzantine detachment at Tarnut on the west bank of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The Byzantines failed to inflict heavy losses but were able to delay the advance by a full day. The Muslim commanders decided to halt the main army at Tarnut and send an advance guard of cavalry forward to clear the path.\n\nNow {{convert|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Tarnut, the Byzantine detachment that had withdrawn from Tarnut the day before joined another that was already at Shareek, and both attacked and routed the Muslim cavalry. The next day, before the Byzantines could annihilate the Muslim advance guard completely, the main Muslim army arrived, prompting the Byzantines to withdraw. The following day, the whole army marched forward without an advance guard. The Muslims reached Sulteis, where they encountered another Byzantine detachment. Hard fighting followed, but the Byzantine resistance soon broke down and they withdrew to Alexandria.\n\nThe Muslims halted at Sulteis for a day, still two days' march from Alexandria. After another day's march, the Muslim forces arrived at Kirayun, {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. There, the Muslim advance to Alexandria was blocked by a Byzantine force about 20,000 strong. The resulting action remained indecisive for ten days.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> However, on the tenth day, the Muslims launched a vigorous assault, forcing the defeated Byzantines to retreat to Alexandria. With the way to Alexandria clear, the Muslims reached the capital's outskirts in March.\n\n===Conquest of Alexandria and fall of Egypt===\n{{Main|Siege of Alexandria (641)}}\nThe Muslims laid siege to Alexandria in March 641.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The city was heavily fortified and provisioned: there were walls within walls and forts within forts. The city also had direct access to the sea by which men and supplies from [[Constantinople]] could come at any time.\n\nAs 'Amr surveyed the military situation, he felt that the conquest of Alexandria would be difficult.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria and were determined to offer stiff resistance to the Muslims. They mounted catapults on the walls of the city, and the engines effectively pounded the Muslims with boulders, prompting 'Amr to withdraw out of range. The ensuing battle see-sawed:<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> when the Muslims approached the city, they were pelted with missiles, and, when the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by the Muslims.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, collected a large army at Constantinople, intending to lead it personally to Alexandria. However, before he could finalize the arrangements, he died. The troops mustered at Constantinople dispersed, and no help came to Alexandria, which further demoralied the defenders. The siege dragged on for six months, and in [[Madinah]], 'Umar, got impatient. In a letter addressed to 'Amr, the caliph, concerned at the inordinate delay, appointed 'Ubaidah as field commander to assault the fort. 'Ubaidah's assault was successful, and [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Alexandria was captured]] by the Muslims in September. Thousands of Byzantine soldiers were killed or taken captive, and others managed to flee to Constantinople on ships that had been anchored in the port. Some wealthy traders also left.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nOn behalf of the Egyptians, Cyrus of Alexandria sued for peace, and his request was granted. After the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr is reported{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to have written to 'Umar, \"We have conquered Alexandria. In this city there are 4,000 palaces, 400 places of entertainment, and untold wealth.\"\n\nOn the twentieth of Maskaram (approximately September 18 according to the Julian calendar), the Byzantine general, Theodorus, and all of his troops proceeded to the island of [[Cyprus]], abandoning [[Alexandria]] to 'Amr. The conquest represented a huge loss of food and money to Byzantium and, coupled with the conquest of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the later [[Umayyad invasion of North Africa|invasion of the Exarchate of Africa]], meant that the Mediterranean, long referred to as the \"Roman lake\", was now contested between the [[Muslim Caliphate]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The latter, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to [[Anatolia]], while the [[walls of Constantinople]] would withstand two great Muslim sieges, saving the Byzantines from the fate of the Persian Empire.<ref>Kaegli, Walter. Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium.</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Nubia==\nIn the summer of 642, 'Amr ibn al-'As sent an expedition to the Christian kingdom of [[Nubia]], which bordered Egypt to the south, under the command of his cousin 'Uqbah ibn Nafi as a pre-emptive raid to announce the arrival of new rulers in Egypt.<ref>Akram, A.I., ''Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-597712-7}}</ref> 'Uqbah ibn Nafi, who later made a great name for himself as the conqueror of Africa and led his horse to the Atlantic, had an unhappy experience in Nubia. No pitched battle was fought, but there were only [[skirmishes]] and haphazard engagements, the type of warfare in which the Nubians excelled. They were skilful archers and subjected the Muslims to a merciless barrage of arrows, resulting in 250 Muslims losing their eyes in the engagement.\n\nThe Nubian cavalry displayed remarkable speed,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> even more so than the Muslim cavalry. The Nubians would strike hard and then vanish before the Muslims could recover and counterattack. The hit-and-run raids took their toll on the Muslim expedition. 'Uqbah reported that to 'Amr,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> who ordered 'Uqbah to withdraw from Nubia, terminating the expedition.\n\n==Conquest of North Africa==\nAfter the expedition to Nubia, 'Amr opted to secure the western borders of Egypt and clear the regions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] of Byzantine influence. In September 642, 'Amr led his troops west. After one month of marching the Muslim forces reached the cities of the [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]]. From Burqa, he sent 'Uqbah bin Nafi at the head of a column to undertake a campaign against Fezzan, in present-day northwestern [[Libya]]. 'Uqbah marched to Zaweela, the capital; the entire district then submitted to the Muslims without resistance. 'Uqbah then returned to [[Brak, Libya|Burqa]]. Soon after the Muslim army marched westward from there, arriving at [[Tripoli]] in the spring of 643. The city fell after a siege of one month. From there, 'Amr sent a detachment to [[Sabratha]], 65 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) away. The city put up feeble resistance, and soon surrendered and agreed to pay Jizya. From Tripoli, 'Amr is reported{{whom|date=May 2019}} to have reported to the caliph, \"We have conquered Burqa, Tripoli and Sabratha. The way to the west is clear, and if the Commander of the Faithful wishes to conquer more lands, we could do so with the grace of God.\"\n\n'Umar, whose armies were already engaged in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]], did not want to commit his forces further in North Africa while Muslim rule in Egypt was still insecure. The caliph accordingly ordered 'Amr to consolidate the Muslims' position in Egypt and that there should be no further campaigning. 'Amr obeyed, abandoning Tripoli and Burqa and returning to [[Fustat]] towards the close of 643.<ref name=\"Haykalch24\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 24}}</ref>\n\n==Taxation under Muslim rule==\nThose who refused to convert to Islam were taxed in the form of money and food for the occupying troops, and in exchange, the taxpayers were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. The system was a new institution, a religious mandate, but carried over from previous [[poll tax]] systems in the ancient Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Indeed, the Egyptians had been subject to it, as non-Romans, during Roman rule before the [[Christianization|adoption of Christianity]] by the Roman state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Then, all non-Christian subjects of the [[Roman Empire]] had to pay it, including non-Christian Egyptians.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Persians also had a similar poll tax system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Egypt under Muslim rule==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Rashidun Empire at its peak under third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman- 654 {{legend|#009900|Strongholds of Rashidun Caliphate}}]]\nMuslims gained control over Egypt by  a variety of factors, including internal Byzantine politics, religious zeal and the difficulty of maintaining a large empire. The Byzantines attempted to regain Alexandria, but it was retaken by 'Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repelled. No serious effort was then made by the Byzantines to regain possession of Egypt.\n\nIn ''The Great Arab Conquests'', Hugh Kennedy writes that Cyrus, the Roman governor, had exiled the Coptic patriarch, [[Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria|Benjamin]]. When 'Amr occupied Alexandria, a Coptic nobleman (''duqs'') called Sanutius persuaded him to send out a proclamation of safe conduct for Benjamin and an invitation to return to Alexandria. When Benjamin arrived, after 13 years in hiding, Amr treated him with respect. Benjamin was then instructed by the governor to resume control over the [[Coptic Church]]. He arranged for the restoration of the monasteries in the [[Wadi Natrun]], which had been ruined by the [[Chalcedonean Christians]]; four of them still survive as functioning monasteries.<ref name=\"Kennedy164\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn Amr's return, the Egyptian population also worked with him.<ref name=\"Kennedy167\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=167}}</ref> Kennedy wrote, \"The pious biographer of Coptic patriarch Benjamin presents us with the striking image of the patriarch prayed for the success of the Muslim commander Amr against the Christians of the Cyrenaica. Benjamin survived for almost twenty years after the fall of Egypt to the Muslims, dying of full years and honour in 661. His body was laid to rest in the [[monastery of St Macarius]], where he is still venerated as a saint. There can be no doubt that he played a major role in the survival of the Coptic Church\".<ref name=\"Kennedy164\"/> Benjamin also prayed for 'Amr when he attempted to take Libya.<ref name=\"Kennedy163\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=163}}</ref>\n\nKennedy also wrote, \"Even more striking is the verdict of John of Nikiu. John was no admirer of Muslim government and was fierce in his denunciation, but he says of Amr: 'He extracted the taxes which had been determined upon but he took none of the property of the churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.... Of all the early Muslim conquests, that of Egypt was the swiftest and most complete. Within a space of two years the country had come entirely under Arab rule. Even more remarkably, it has remained under Muslim rule ever since. Seldom in history can so massive a political change have happened so swiftly and been so long lasting.\"<ref name=\"Kennedy165\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=165}}</ref>\n\n[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] then used Egypt as a launch pad to move across North Africa, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"Kennedy212\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=212}}</ref> Kennedy wrote that when Uqba reached the Atlantic, he is said to have ridden his horse into the sea until the water was below his chest, and then shouted, 'O Lord, if the sea did not stop me, I would go through lands like Alexander the Great, defending your faith'. Kennedy writes further that the image of a warrior whose conquest in the name of God was stopped only by the ocean remains important in the history of the conquests.<ref name=\"Kennedy214\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Fustat, the new capital===\nDuring the Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt. When Alexandria was captured by the Muslims, the houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by the Muslims, who were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, \"the queen of cities\". 'Amr wanted Alexandria to remain the capital of Muslim Egypt.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> He wrote to 'Umar to propose that but 'Umar refused on the basis that Alexandria was a [[coast|maritime]] city, and there would always be a danger that the [[Byzantine Navy]] would attack.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He suggested instead for the capital would be established at a central location further inland, where no mass of water separated it from Arabia.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The treaty with Cyrus of Alexandria was followed, and the wealth of the Egyptians in Alexandria was spared and that of Romans and [[Greeks]] was taken as booty. Greek citizens were given a choice: return to Greek territories safely without their wealth or stay in Alexandria and pay [[Jizya]]. Some chose to stay, and others went to Byzantine lands.\n\n'Amr next proceeded to choose a suitable site for the capital of Egypt, eventually settling on the site where he had pitched his tent at the time of the battle of Babylon, about 400 m (500 yd) northeast of the fort. It is reported that after the battle was over and the army was about to march to Alexandria, the men began to pull down the tent and pack it for the journey, and it was found that a [[dove]] had nested on top of the tent and laid eggs. 'Amr ordered that the tent be left standing where it was, where it remained after the army departed. 'Amr took the unusual episode as a sign from Heaven and decided \"where the dove laid its nest, let the people build their city\".\n\nAs 'Amr's tent was to be the focal point of the city, the city was called [[Fustat]], meaning in Arabic \"the tent\". The first structure to be built was the [[mosque]] that later became famous as [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As]].<ref name=\"tertullian.org\">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm</ref> In the course of time, Fustat extended to include the old town of Babylon to the west, becoming the bustling commercial centre of Egypt.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\n==='Umar's reforms===\nTo consolidate his rule in Egypt, 'Umar imposed the jizya on Egyptians. During later [[Umayyad]] rule, higher taxes would be levied. With 'Umar's permission, 'Amr decided to build a [[canal]] to join the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]] to open new markets for Egyptian merchants and an easy route to Arabia and [[Iraq]]. The project was presented to 'Umar, who approved it. A canal was dug and, within a few months, was opened for merchants. It was named \"Nahar Amir ul-Mu'mineen\" (''the canal of the Commander of the Faithful''), after 'Umar's title.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nAmr proposed to dig another canal joining the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> but Umar rejected the plan on the basis that it would open a way for the Byzantine Navy to enter the Red Sea and pose a threat to [[Medina]] itself.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> The plan would not come to fruition until the [[Suez Canal]] was completed 1300 years later. Each year, the caliph earmarked a large amount of jizya, to be used on the building and repairing of canals and bridges.<ref name=\"Haykalch25\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 25}}</ref> The Arabs remained in control of the country from this point until 1250, when it fell under the control of the [[Mamelukes]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aegyptus (Roman province)]]\n*[[Muslim conquests]]\n*[[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]\n*[[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]]\n*[[Spread of Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Betts|first=Robert B.|title=Christians in the Arab East: A Political Study|year=1978|edition=2nd rev.|location=Athens|publisher=Lycabettus Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHstAQAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Alfred |title=The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion |url=https://archive.org/details/arabconquestofeg00butl |year=1902 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Charles|first=Robert H.|authorlink=Robert Charles (scholar)|title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu: Translated from Zotenberg's Ethiopic Text|year=2007|origyear=1916|location=Merchantville, NJ|publisher=Evolution Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZ-DOr77OQC}}\n* {{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |author-link=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=Al Farooq, Umar |year=1944 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Hugh |title=The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in |url=https://archive.org/details/greatarabconques00kenn_0 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81740-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Meyendorff|first=John|author-link=John Meyendorff|year=1989|title=Imperial unity and Christian divisions: The Church 450-680 A.D.|series=The Church in history|volume=2|location=Crestwood, NY|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6J_YAAAAMAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Ostrogorsky|first=George|authorlink=George Ostrogorsky|year=1956|title=History of the Byzantine State|location=Oxford|publisher=Basil Blackwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bt0_AAAAYAAJ}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Gibbon |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519211753/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter51.html |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=51}}\n* {{citation |last=Nikiou |first=Bishop John |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm |title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu |chapter=CXVI\u2013CXXI}}\n\n{{Egypt topics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muslim Conquest Of Egypt}}\n[[Category:640s conflicts]]\n[[Category:7th century in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n", "name_user": "Zirrarali", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected the spelling of the word Mamluk", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt"}

Expenses at this time for a full year were $206.50 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|206.50|1870|r=-1}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) and remained relatively unchanged for the next 50 years.\n\n===Early history (1866\u20131897)===\nThe College was founded by and initially associated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], which occurred through a series of church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the [[Evangelical Association]] in 1946 creating the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (EUB), which subsequently merged with the [[Methodist Church]] in 1968 to create the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818141615/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archivedate=2000-08-18|title=EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH. The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition. 2000|date=18 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong as they once were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.\n\nThe campus began as a single building, the empty Annville Academy building, which was purchased for $4,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1866|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) by five Annville citizens. They presented the building as a gift to the East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Brethren Church to settle the argument over where to establish the college. In a little more than two months from its founding, 12 trustees were appointed, President Thomas R. Vickroy was elected, the building repaired and redecorated, a curriculum devised, faculty recruited, and classes begun. The College was entirely contained in that one building (class rooms, student residence, president's residence, and \"dining hall\") until 1868 when \"North College\" was opened at a cost of $31,500, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|31500|1868|r=-4}}}}  in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. The Annville Academy building became known as \"South Hall\" or \"Ladies Hall\" as the North College building was now the home to the men's dormitories.\n\nA note worth mentioning: The college charter, granted in 1867, specifically stated that Lebanon Valley College was established for the education of ''both'' sexes. Indeed, Lebanon Valley College can claim that it has been coeducational longer than any other college east of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. However, the curricula were different for men and women, a condition created from a compromise after an uproar in the founding church over the equal treatment of men and women. The \"Ladies Course\" included modern languages, painting, drawing, wax flower and fruit making, and music. By 1878, the college catalog began announcing that experience showed that there was no difference between men and women in their ability to master college courses, an unpopular idea at its time.\n\nThis was also the time of the founding literary societies: Philokosmian, Clionian, and Kalozetean, which bear no resemblance to their present fraternity and sorority selves. They met regularly to debate topics and discuss essays. Other activities included mixed socials, parades, the annual Chestnut Picnic, and other special events throughout the years.\n\n===Growth (1897\u20131948)===\nThe College steadily grew during its first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by [[Andrew Carnegie]]. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not to be confused with the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the college raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on the gym and science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The College landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, under the leadership of President George D. Gossard (1912\u20131932) and [[Clyde A. Lynch]] (1932\u20131950).<ref>''Pennsylvania School Journal'', Volume 81 (Pennsylvania State Education Association, 1932), p. 285</ref> <ref>\u201dDr Clyde A. Lynch\u201d (obituary) in ''The Torch'', Volumes 23-24 (International Association of Torch Clubs, 1950), p. 41</ref>\n\nCultural changes at LVC paralleled those in the rest of the country, moving through [[World War I]], the [[Roaring Twenties]], the [[Great Depression]], and the [[New Deal]].\n\n===Mid-century and modern day (1948\u2013present)===\n[[World War II]] nearly proved to be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime registration showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing College. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign\u2014Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.\n\nEnrollment steadily grew and by 1948, thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]], it had reached 817 full-time students, far beyond the college's capacity. Eventually additional facilities and residences were added to the college. Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall\u2014which included the school's first proper gymnasium\u2014was opened in 1953. In 1957, Science Hall (now the Derickson A apartments) was created out of the old Kreider Factory building on White Oak St., and Gossard Library also opened that year. In 1966, Frederic K. Miller Chapel was completed. The 1950s also saw the college expand north of Sheridan Avenue, with the Dining Hall (now Lehr and Phillips Dining Hall) built in 1958. Other current traditional residence halls were built between the 1950s and 1970s as well\u2014Mary Green (1956) and Vickroy (1960) in the 1950s-60s, Hammond and Keister Hall in 1965, and Funkhouser and Silver in the 1970s. Marquette and Dellinger were added in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and Stanson was added in 2009.\n\nEnrollment also grew, although it had stagnated by the 1980s. A turnaround began under the presidency of Arthur L. Peterson, whose tenure in office was cut short due to health issues. Soon thereafter, a highly energetic president, John Synodinos, ushered in a period of growth and change with the bold introduction of merit scholarships and the renovation and beautification of a substantial portion of the campus that included the addition of the Edward H. Arnold Sports Center and the Suzanne H. Arnold Art Gallery and Zimmerman Recital hall. With the assistance of Dr. William J. McGill, senior vice president and the dean of the faculty, academic excellence continued to be emphasized, linkages were established with other institutions and schools, an international initiative undertaken, and collaborative learning experiences developed. A new technologically advanced library, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library, opened in January 1996.\n\nBeginning in 1996 and building on the work of his predecessor, Dr. G. David Pollick\u2019s eight-year presidency ushered in a period of continued growth. There was a 40 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment with applications more than doubling. New undergraduate and graduate degree programs were added and there was a large increase in the number of first-year students who studied abroad.  A major public relations focus to enhance the college's standing among peer institutions was followed by a major rebuilding and renovation effort on campus and the start of a $50 million campaign, Great Expectations. Pollick oversaw a growth plan that added athletic teams, more than a dozen new campus buildings and athletic facilities, and the college's signature Fasick Bridge. These additions almost tripled the usable space of the college, including five new facilities: the Marquette and Dellinger Residence Halls, the Allan W. Mund College Center, Sorrentino Gymnasium, and the Heilman Center. A revitalization of Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall and the Neidig-Garber Science Center also were begun during this period.\n[[File:LVC Peace Garden.jpg|thumb|250x250px|An aerial view of LVC's Peace Garden, taken by Blue Fuego. The Peace Garden is in the middle of the college's Residential Quad and is a popular place to study, relax, or take milestone photographs, especially weddings.]]\nToday, the campus consists of 40 buildings, including the recently renovated Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library (revitalized in 2016), the Heilman Center for communication sciences & disorders/speech-language pathology, and $20 million Jeanne and Edward H. Arnold Health Professions Pavilion (opened August 2018) for athletic training, exercise science, and physical therapy. Students received career advice from experts in the Edward and Lynn Breen Center for Graduate Success (launched programming in 2018) and study under the college's new general education curriculum, Constellation LVC (started in fall 2016). Students reside in one of 25 residence halls that include traditional single-sex and co-educational dormitories and apartment-style residences. Students may also reside in special interest houses upon proposal and approval of LVC administration. A small number of upperclassmen are allowed to live off-campus, and a significant portion of the student body are commuter students as well. Undergraduate enrollment is now over 1,638 students.\n\nThe endowment of the college is sixty-five million dollars.\n\n===Lost lore and traditions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}{{Original research section|date=April 2017}}\nMany college traditions have disappeared and been forgotten, much to the chagrin of most alumni. At most colleges and universities, there seems to be a compulsion to make fools of the freshman students. Lebanon Valley College was no different in this regard, as most of the traditions existed for this very reason.\n\n====May Day====\nA festive tradition, this pageant was begun in 1912. Each year, a May Queen would be elected and would watch over the festival with her court. Typical [[May Day]] activities took place, including the expected [[May pole]]. This tradition seems to have persisted for 55 years until the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

One evening after a football game, President Gossard had decided to change the policy and allowed the students to dance with his blessing. From then on, the literary societies began holding annual dinner dances. Formal proms were organized and any opportunity for dancing was not overlooked.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

The UG is a place where students can go to have fun with their classmates and friends on most Saturday nights.  The UG plays popular hits from today's music and is open to non-LVC students at a small price.\n\n'''March to the President's House'''\n\nIn a tradition that dates to the presidency of [[Clyde A. Lynch]] '18 [1932\u20131950] students march to the president's home, Kreiderheim since 1976, to request the day off before Thanksgiving when the football team defeats Albright College. LVC defeated Albright in double overtime in 2018 and President Thayne granted the students' wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godutchmen.com/news/2018/11/12/football-day-off-you-got-it-students-march-on-kreiderheim.aspx?path=football|title=Day Off?

Expenses at this time for a full year were $206.50 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|206.50|1870|r=-1}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) and remained relatively unchanged for the next 50 years.\n\n===Early history (1866\u20131897)===\nThe College was founded by and initially associated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], which occurred through a series of church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the [[Evangelical Association]] in 1946 creating the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (EUB), which subsequently merged with the [[Methodist Church]] in 1968 to create the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818141615/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archivedate=2000-08-18|title=EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH. The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition. 2000|date=18 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong as they once were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.\n\nThe campus began as a single building, the empty Annville Academy building, which was purchased for $4,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1866|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) by five Annville citizens. They presented the building as a gift to the East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Brethren Church to settle the argument over where to establish the college. In a little more than two months from its founding, 12 trustees were appointed, President Thomas R. Vickroy was elected, the building repaired and redecorated, a curriculum devised, faculty recruited, and classes begun. The College was entirely contained in that one building (class rooms, student residence, president's residence, and \"dining hall\") until 1868 when \"North College\" was opened at a cost of $31,500, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|31500|1868|r=-4}}}}  in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. The Annville Academy building became known as \"South Hall\" or \"Ladies Hall\" as the North College building was now the home to the men's dormitories.\n\nA note worth mentioning: The college charter, granted in 1867, specifically stated that Lebanon Valley College was established for the education of ''both'' sexes. Indeed, Lebanon Valley College can claim that it has been coeducational longer than any other college east of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. However, the curricula were different for men and women, a condition created from a compromise after an uproar in the founding church over the equal treatment of men and women. The \"Ladies Course\" included modern languages, painting, drawing, wax flower and fruit making, and music. By 1878, the college catalog began announcing that experience showed that there was no difference between men and women in their ability to master college courses, an unpopular idea at its time.\n\nThis was also the time of the founding literary societies: Philokosmian, Clionian, and Kalozetean, which bear no resemblance to their present fraternity and sorority selves. They met regularly to debate topics and discuss essays. Other activities included mixed socials, parades, the annual Chestnut Picnic, and other special events throughout the years.\n\n===Growth (1897\u20131948)===\nThe College steadily grew during its first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by [[Andrew Carnegie]]. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not to be confused with the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the college raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on the gym and science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The College landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, under the leadership of President George D. Gossard (1912\u20131932) and [[Clyde A. Lynch]] (1932\u20131950).<ref>''Pennsylvania School Journal'', Volume 81 (Pennsylvania State Education Association, 1932), p. 285</ref> <ref>\u201dDr Clyde A. Lynch\u201d (obituary) in ''The Torch'', Volumes 23-24 (International Association of Torch Clubs, 1950), p. 41</ref>\n\nCultural changes at LVC paralleled those in the rest of the country, moving through [[World War I]], the [[Roaring Twenties]], the [[Great Depression]], and the [[New Deal]].\n\n===Mid-century and modern day (1948\u2013present)===\n[[World War II]] nearly proved to be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime registration showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing College. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign\u2014Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.\n\nEnrollment steadily grew and by 1948, thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]], it had reached 817 full-time students, far beyond the college's capacity. Eventually additional facilities and residences were added to the college. Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall\u2014which included the school's first proper gymnasium\u2014was opened in 1953. In 1957, Science Hall (now the Derickson A apartments) was created out of the old Kreider Factory building on White Oak St., and Gossard Library also opened that year. In 1966, Frederic K. Miller Chapel was completed. The 1950s also saw the college expand north of Sheridan Avenue, with the Dining Hall (now Lehr and Phillips Dining Hall) built in 1958. Other current traditional residence halls were built between the 1950s and 1970s as well\u2014Mary Green (1956) and Vickroy (1960) in the 1950s-60s, Hammond and Keister Hall in 1965, and Funkhouser and Silver in the 1970s. Marquette and Dellinger were added in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and Stanson was added in 2009.\n\nEnrollment also grew, although it had stagnated by the 1980s. A turnaround began under the presidency of Arthur L. Peterson, whose tenure in office was cut short due to health issues. Soon thereafter, a highly energetic president, John Synodinos, ushered in a period of growth and change with the bold introduction of merit scholarships and the renovation and beautification of a substantial portion of the campus that included the addition of the Edward H. Arnold Sports Center and the Suzanne H. Arnold Art Gallery and Zimmerman Recital hall. With the assistance of Dr. William J. McGill, senior vice president and the dean of the faculty, academic excellence continued to be emphasized, linkages were established with other institutions and schools, an international initiative undertaken, and collaborative learning experiences developed. A new technologically advanced library, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library, opened in January 1996.\n\nBeginning in 1996 and building on the work of his predecessor, Dr. G. David Pollick\u2019s eight-year presidency ushered in a period of continued growth. There was a 40 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment with applications more than doubling. New undergraduate and graduate degree programs were added and there was a large increase in the number of first-year students who studied abroad.  A major public relations focus to enhance the college's standing among peer institutions was followed by a major rebuilding and renovation effort on campus and the start of a $50 million campaign, Great Expectations. Pollick oversaw a growth plan that added athletic teams, more than a dozen new campus buildings and athletic facilities, and the college's signature Fasick Bridge. These additions almost tripled the usable space of the college, including five new facilities: the Marquette and Dellinger Residence Halls, the Allan W. Mund College Center, Sorrentino Gymnasium, and the Heilman Center. A revitalization of Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall and the Neidig-Garber Science Center also were begun during this period.\n[[File:LVC Peace Garden.jpg|thumb|250x250px|An aerial view of LVC's Peace Garden, taken by Blue Fuego. The Peace Garden is in the middle of the college's Residential Quad and is a popular place to study, relax, or take milestone photographs, especially weddings.]]\nToday, the campus consists of 40 buildings, including the recently renovated Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library (revitalized in 2016), the Heilman Center for communication sciences & disorders/speech-language pathology, and $20 million Jeanne and Edward H. Arnold Health Professions Pavilion (opened August 2018) for athletic training, exercise science, and physical therapy. Students received career advice from experts in the Edward and Lynn Breen Center for Graduate Success (launched programming in 2018) and study under the college's new general education curriculum, Constellation LVC (started in fall 2016). Students reside in one of 25 residence halls that include traditional single-sex and co-educational dormitories and apartment-style residences. Students may also reside in special interest houses upon proposal and approval of LVC administration. A small number of upperclassmen are allowed to live off-campus, and a significant portion of the student body are commuter students as well. Undergraduate enrollment is now over 1,638 students.\n\nThe endowment of the college is sixty-five million dollars.\n\n===Lost lore and traditions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}{{Original research section|date=April 2017}}\nMany college traditions have disappeared and been forgotten, much to the chagrin of most alumni. At most colleges and universities, there seems to be a compulsion to make fools of the freshman students. Lebanon Valley College was no different in this regard, as most of the traditions existed for this very reason.\n\n====May Day====\nA festive tradition, this pageant was begun in 1912. Each year, a May Queen would be elected and would watch over the festival with her court. Typical [[May Day]] activities took place, including the expected [[May pole]]. This tradition seems to have persisted for 55 years until the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

One evening after a football game, President Gossard had decided to change the policy and allowed the students to dance with his blessing. From then on, the literary societies began holding annual dinner dances. Formal proms were organized and any opportunity for dancing was not overlooked.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

The UG is a place where students can go to have fun with their classmates and friends on most Saturday nights.  The UG plays popular hits from today's music and is open to non-LVC students at a small price.\n\n'''March to the President's House'''\n\nIn a tradition that dates to the presidency of Clyde A. Lynch '18 [1932\u20131950] students march to the president's home, Kreiderheim since 1976, to request the day off before Thanksgiving when the football team defeats Albright College. LVC defeated Albright in double overtime in 2018 and President Thayne granted the students' wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godutchmen.com/news/2018/11/12/football-day-off-you-got-it-students-march-on-kreiderheim.aspx?path=football|title=Day Off?

It was also Everton's 115th season of league football and [[List of Everton F.C. seasons|117th season in all competitions]]. It was the first season without [[David Moyes]] as manager since 2002, with Moyes leaving Everton to succeed [[Alex Ferguson]] as manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. In addition, the club crest was redesigned ahead of this season for the first time since 2000.

The team almost went an entire year unbeaten at home but lost 1\u20130 against [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] on [[Boxing Day]]. Everton's progress stalled somewhat in the early part of 2014 with three losses in four games against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and Chelsea, before winning seven league games in a row for the first time since 1987. The spell contained perhaps Everton's best performance of the season when they defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3\u20130. The streak was ended with a 3\u20132 home defeat by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], but Everton returned to do the double over Manchester United for the first time since 1969. Moyes was sacked as their manager a day later. Two defeats in a row after this ended Everton's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] hopes but a finish of 5th in the league table is their highest in five years with Everton qualifying for next season's [[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].

of Goodison Park (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Goodison Park]] \u2013 Everton's home ground]]\n{{quote box |quote=\"Attendances have been fantastic this season. If you look at the past four or five seasons and look at the number of full houses and look at average attendances, then the trend has been very positive. In 2013/14, we've had nine full houses and we're very pleased and very proud to have had that. We've also had an average attendance of well over 37,500, and I think as everybody knows, when we get to 36,000 at Goodison we start selling restricted view seats. To be substantially ahead of that figure is a great achievement. What it means is we've now set a very ambitious target for next season. That target is that three out of every four seats will be pre-sold before the first ball of the season is kicked.

F.C.|Everton]]'s 22nd season in the [[Premier League]] and 60th consecutive season in the top division of [[Football in England|English football]]. It was also Everton's 115th season of league football and [[List of Everton F.C. seasons|117th season in all competitions]]. It was the first season without [[David Moyes]] as manager since 2002, with Moyes leaving Everton to succeed [[Alex Ferguson]] as manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. In addition, the club crest was redesigned ahead of this season for the first time since 2000. On 5 June 2013, [[Roberto Mart\u00ednez]] was announced as the new Everton manager, having left his post at relegated [[FA Cup]] holders [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Roberto Martinez: Everton appoint former Wigan manager|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22750453|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=5 June 2013}}</ref> Everton finished in sixth position in the domestic league in the [[2012\u201313 Everton F.C. season|previous season]], missing out on qualification for the [[UEFA Europa League]], meaning it failed to qualify for any [[UEFA#Competitions|European competitions]] for the fourth season running.\n\nEverton's [[Premier League]] campaign began in August 2013 with Mart\u00ednez changing their style of play to a possession based, attractive brand of football which initially led to three successive draws to start the season.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/10422651/Roberto-Martinez-is-transforming-Everton.html | title=Roberto Mart\u00ednez is transforming Everton | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref> A first victory came in the next match 1\u20130 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and by Christmas Everton had only suffered one defeat, a run which included a win over Moyes' Manchester United, the first time the club had tasted success at [[Old Trafford]] in 21 years. The team almost went an entire year unbeaten at home but lost 1\u20130 against [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] on [[Boxing Day]]. Everton's progress stalled somewhat in the early part of 2014 with three losses in four games against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and Chelsea, before winning seven league games in a row for the first time since 1987. The spell contained perhaps Everton's best performance of the season when they defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3\u20130. The streak was ended with a 3\u20132 home defeat by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], but Everton returned to do the double over Manchester United for the first time since 1969. Moyes was sacked as their manager a day later. Two defeats in a row after this ended Everton's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] hopes but a finish of 5th in the league table is their highest in five years with Everton qualifying for next season's [[2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. Mart\u00ednez utilised the [[Loan (sports)|loan]] market during the season, with [[Romelu Lukaku]] (on loan from Chelsea) being Everton's top scorer with 16 goals in all competitions.

If you look at the past four or five seasons and look at the number of full houses and look at average attendances, then the trend has been very positive. In 2013/14, we've had nine full houses and we're very pleased and very proud to have had that. We've also had an average attendance of well over 37,500, and I think as everybody knows, when we get to 36,000 at Goodison we start selling restricted view seats. To be substantially ahead of that figure is a great achievement. What it means is we've now set a very ambitious target for next season. That target is that three out of every four seats will be pre-sold before the first ball of the season is kicked. When you add in hospitality sales and the Season Ticket target, we're looking at 30,000 tickets already pre-sold, and that would be really great news for the football club.\"\n|source=[[Robert Elstone]], Everton's Chief Executive Officer, on the season's attendances at [[Goodison Park]], 6 May 2014.<ref name=\"attendances\">{{cite web | url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2014/05/06/everton-s-early-bird-success | title=Everton's Early Bird Success | publisher=[[Everton F.C.]] | accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref> |align=right |width=30%}}\n\n<small>Correct as of match played 3 May 2014.</small><br>\n{{legend2|#CCFFCC|Win|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFFFCC|Draw|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFCCCC|Loss|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n<br>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!width=100 | Comp\n!width=120 | Date\n!width=60 | Score\n!width=250 class=\"unsortable\" | Opponent\n!width=150 | Attendance\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||24 August 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"|0\u20130 ||[[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] ||36,410\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Football League Cup|League Cup]]||28 August 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20131 ||[[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] ||22,730\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||14 September 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|1\u20130 ||[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] ||36,034\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||30 September 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|3\u20132 ||[[Newcastle F.C.|Newcastle]] ||33,495\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||19 October 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20131 ||[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] ||38,828\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||3 November 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"|0\u20130 ||[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ||38,378\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||23 November 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"|3\u20133 ||[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] ||39,576\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||30 November 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|4\u20130 ||[[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] ||35,513\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||14 December 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|4\u20131 ||[[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] ||33,796\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||26 December 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|0\u20131 ||[[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] ||39,193\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||29 December 2013 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20131 ||[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] ||39,092\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 FA Cup|FA Cup]]||4 January 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|4\u20130 ||[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] ||32,283\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||11 January 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20130 ||[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] ||36,827\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||1 February 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20131 ||[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] ||39,469\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 FA Cup|FA Cup]]||16 February 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|3\u20131 ||[[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] ||31,498\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||1 March 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|1\u20130 ||[[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] ||38,286\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||15 March 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20131 ||[[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] ||38,018\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||22 March 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|3\u20132 ||[[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] ||36,260\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||6 April 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|3\u20130 ||[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] ||39,504\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||16 April 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|2\u20133 ||[[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] ||39,333\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||20 April 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2\u20130 ||[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] ||39,436\n|-\n|[[2013\u201314 Premier League|Premier League]]||3 May 2014 ||bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|2\u20133 ||[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] ||39,454\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n| '''Total attendance'''\n|'''803,413'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n| '''Total league attendance'''\n|'''716,902'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n| '''Average attendance'''\n|'''36,519'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|\n| '''Average league attendance'''\n|'''37,732'''\n{{Fb cs footer|s=Match reports in [[#Matches|Results]]|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Transfers ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== In ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

In his youth he was educated by the [[Franciscan]] friars in Paola.

By 1436, he and two followers began a movement that would become the foundation of the '''Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi''', which would later be renamed as the  [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friars]]. Their name refers to their role as the \"least of all the faithful\". Humility was to be the hallmark of the brothers as it had been in Francis's personal life. Abstinence from meat and other animal products became a \"fourth vow\" of his religious order, along with the traditional vows of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]]. Francis instituted the continual, year-round observance of this diet in an effort to revive the tradition of fasting during Lent, which many Roman Catholics had ceased to practice by the 15th century.<ref name=cna>[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=423 \"St. Francis of Paola\", Catholic News Agency]</ref> The rule of life adopted by Francis and his religious was one of extraordinary severity.

The building of this monastery was the occasion of a great outburst of enthusiasm and devotion on the part of the people towards Francis: even the nobles carried stones and joined in the work. Their devotion was increased by the many miracles which the saint wrought in answer to their prayers.<ref name=hess/>\n\nIn 1474 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] gave him permission to write a rule for his community, and to assume the title of Hermits of St. Francis: this rule was formally approved by [[Pope Alexander VI]], who, however, changed their title into that of \"Minims\".<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ.

He also established monasteries of nuns, and a [[third order]] for people living in the world, after the example of St. Francis of Assisi. He was no respecter of persons based solely on their worldly rank or position. He rebuked the King of Naples for his ill-doing and in consequence suffered persecution.<ref name=foley/> \n\n==France==\nWhen King [[Louis XI of France]] was in his last illness, he sent an embassy to Calabria to beg the saint to visit him. Francis refused to come until the pope ordered him to go.

Francis also influenced many in the French church, particularly [[Jan Standonck]], who founded the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu]] along what he thought were Minimist lines. The regard in which Charles VIII held the saint was shared by Louis XII, who succeeded to the French throne in 1498.\n\nFrancis was now eager to return to Italy, but the king would not permit him, not wishing to lose his counsels and direction. Francis spent the last three months of his life in entire solitude, preparing for death.<ref name=cna/> On [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] of 1507 he gathered his community around him and exhorted them especially to have mutual charity amongst themselves and to maintain the rigour of their life and in particular perpetual abstinence. The next day, [[Good Friday]], he again called them together and gave them his last instructions and appointed a [[Vicar General]]. He then received the [[last rites]] and asked to have the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] according to [[Gospel of St. John|St. John]] read out to him, and whilst this was being read, he died on 2 April 1507, almost a week after his 91st birthday, in Plessis.\n\n==Diet==\n[[File:Bormes frdepaule.jpg|thumb|Francis de Paula, Bormes-les-Mimosas, France]]\n\nFrancis followed a diet not only free from animal flesh, but also from all animal-derived foods, such as [[Egg as food|egg]]s and [[dairy]] products.<ref>Dr. Holly Roberts, ''Vegetarian Christian Saints'', Anjeli Press, 2004, p. 146.</ref> One of the vows of the order he founded was the abstinence from meat, fish, eggs, butter, cheese and milk.<ref>F.

In 1515, King Louis XII died without a male heir and the throne went to Francis I, of the royal family's Valois-Angoul\u00eame branch.

After the Mass and divine office had been said for the repose of his soul, St. Francis ordered the corpse to be carried from the church into his cell, where he continued praying until, to her great astonishment, the boy's life was restored and Francis presented him to his mother in perfect health.

To him it was just a delicious dish, so he caught it and took it home, tossing it into the frying pan.  Francis missed \u2018Antonella\u2019 and realized what had happened.  He asked one of his followers to go to the priest to get it back.  The priest, annoyed by this great concern for a mere fish, threw the cooked trout on the ground, shattering it into several pieces.  The [[hermit]] sent by Francis gathered up the broken pieces in his hands and brought them back to Francis.  Francis placed the pieces back in the pool and, looking up to Heaven and praying, said: \u2018Antonella, in the name of Charity, return to life.\u2019  The trout immediately became whole and swam joyously around his pool as if nothing had happened.  The friars and the workers who witnessed this miracle were deeply impressed by the miracle.\"{{cite this quote}}\n\nSt. Francis also raised his pet lamb from the dead after it had been killed and eaten by workmen. \"Being in need of food, the workmen caught and slaughtered Francis\u2019 pet lamb, Martinello, roasting it in their lime kiln.  They were eating when the Saint approached them, looking for the lamb.  They told him they had eaten it, having no other food.  He asked what they had done with the fleece and the bones.

Francis instituted the continual, year-round observance of this diet in an effort to revive the tradition of fasting during Lent, which many Roman Catholics had ceased to practice by the 15th century.<ref name=cna>[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=423 \"St. Francis of Paola\", Catholic News Agency]</ref> The rule of life adopted by Francis and his religious was one of extraordinary severity. He felt that heroic mortification was necessary as a means for spiritual growth.<ref name=foley/> They were to seek to live unknown and hidden from the world.\n\nThe number of his disciples gradually increased, and about 1454, with the permission of Pyrrhus, [[Archbishop of Cosenza]], Francis built a large monastery and church. The building of this monastery was the occasion of a great outburst of enthusiasm and devotion on the part of the people towards Francis: even the nobles carried stones and joined in the work. Their devotion was increased by the many miracles which the saint wrought in answer to their prayers.<ref name=hess/>\n\nIn 1474 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] gave him permission to write a rule for his community, and to assume the title of Hermits of St. Francis: this rule was formally approved by [[Pope Alexander VI]], who, however, changed their title into that of \"Minims\".<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ.

He also established monasteries of nuns, and a [[third order]] for people living in the world, after the example of St. Francis of Assisi. He was no respecter of persons based solely on their worldly rank or position. He rebuked the King of Naples for his ill-doing and in consequence suffered persecution.<ref name=foley/> \n\n==France==\nWhen King [[Louis XI of France]] was in his last illness, he sent an embassy to Calabria to beg the saint to visit him. Francis refused to come until the pope ordered him to go. Embarking at Ostia, he landed in France, and cured many sick of the plague in Provence as he passed.<ref name=butler/> He then went to the king at his residence, the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Plessis-lez-Tours]] (now within the village of [[La Riche]]), and was with him at his death.<ref name=foley/> He became a tutor of the heir, Charles VIII, who kept him near the court and frequently consulted him.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kfXtdrD6kVIC&pg=PA317&lpg=PA317&dq=charles+viii+%2B+francesco+de+Paola&source=bl&ots=fgt47YfJSr&sig=ACfU3U1F2l10D3UNYWPfnuh0B9xBdLwuKA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjL7ozc48PjAhVSTd8KHUHeBgkQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=charles%20viii%20%20%20francesco%20de%20Paola&f=false ''Royal and Republican Sovereignty in Early Modern Europe'' (Ragnhild Marie Hatton et al., eds.)

Francis also influenced many in the French church, particularly [[Jan Standonck]], who founded the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu]] along what he thought were Minimist lines. The regard in which Charles VIII held the saint was shared by Louis XII, who succeeded to the French throne in 1498.\n\nFrancis was now eager to return to Italy, but the king would not permit him, not wishing to lose his counsels and direction. Francis spent the last three months of his life in entire solitude, preparing for death.<ref name=cna/> On [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] of 1507 he gathered his community around him and exhorted them especially to have mutual charity amongst themselves and to maintain the rigour of their life and in particular perpetual abstinence. The next day, [[Good Friday]], he again called them together and gave them his last instructions and appointed a [[Vicar General]]. He then received the [[last rites]] and asked to have the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] according to [[Gospel of St. John|St. John]] read out to him, and whilst this was being read, he died on 2 April 1507, almost a week after his 91st birthday, in Plessis.\n\n==Diet==\n[[File:Bormes frdepaule.jpg|thumb|Francis de Paula, Bormes-les-Mimosas, France]]\n\nFrancis followed a diet not only free from animal flesh, but also from all animal-derived foods, such as [[Egg as food|egg]]s and [[dairy]] products.<ref>Dr. Holly Roberts, ''Vegetarian Christian Saints'', Anjeli Press, 2004, p. 146.</ref> One of the vows of the order he founded was the abstinence from meat, fish, eggs, butter, cheese and milk.<ref>F.

It depicts Francis of Paola, who was revered in France because he visited the country in 1482, at the bedside of Louise of Savoy to announce that she will give birth to the next king of France, the future Francis I. In 1515, King Louis XII died without a male heir and the throne went to Francis I, of the royal family's Valois-Angoul\u00eame branch. Louise of Savoy and her spouse, the Count of Angoul\u00eame, who is almost certainly the figure depicted to the left of the bed, decided to name the child Francis in honor of the saint.<ref>[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/saint-francis-paola-prophesying-birth-son-future-francis-i-king-france-born-1494-loui \"Saint Francis of Paola Prophesying the Birth of a Son to Louise of Savoy\", Louvre]</ref>\n\n==Legends==\nAccording to a famous story, in the year 1464, he was refused passage by a boatman while trying to cross the [[Strait of Messina]] to [[Sicily]].

After the Mass and divine office had been said for the repose of his soul, St. Francis ordered the corpse to be carried from the church into his cell, where he continued praying until, to her great astonishment, the boy's life was restored and Francis presented him to his mother in perfect health.

To him it was just a delicious dish, so he caught it and took it home, tossing it into the frying pan.  Francis missed \u2018Antonella\u2019 and realized what had happened.  He asked one of his followers to go to the priest to get it back.  The priest, annoyed by this great concern for a mere fish, threw the cooked trout on the ground, shattering it into several pieces.  The [[hermit]] sent by Francis gathered up the broken pieces in his hands and brought them back to Francis.  Francis placed the pieces back in the pool and, looking up to Heaven and praying, said: \u2018Antonella, in the name of Charity, return to life.\u2019  The trout immediately became whole and swam joyously around his pool as if nothing had happened.  The friars and the workers who witnessed this miracle were deeply impressed by the miracle.\"{{cite this quote}}\n\nSt. Francis also raised his pet lamb from the dead after it had been killed and eaten by workmen. \"Being in need of food, the workmen caught and slaughtered Francis\u2019 pet lamb, Martinello, roasting it in their lime kiln.  They were eating when the Saint approached them, looking for the lamb.  They told him they had eaten it, having no other food.  He asked what they had done with the fleece and the bones.

The definitive rule was approved in 1506<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/spirit/documents/spirit_20010402_francesco-paola_en.html \"Turn to the Lord with a pure heart\", Letter of St. Francis de Paola, 1486]</ref> by [[Pope Julius II]], who also approved a rule for the nuns of the Order. A [[Third Order]] of their movement was also approved. The most noted member of this Order was the illustrious French bishop, St. [[Francis de Sales]]. Although the Minim order lost many of its monasteries in the 18th century during the French Revolution, it continues to exist, primarily in Italy.<ref name=cna/>\n\nIn 1562, a group of Protestant [[Huguenot]]s in [[France]] broke open his tomb and found the saint's body [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]].

In this brief, mention is made of a devotion which originated with St. Francis himself, who, on each of 13 Fridays, used to recite 13 Pater Nosters (Our Fathers) and as many Ave Marias (Hail Marys), and this devotion he promulgated by word of mouth and by letter to his own devout followers, as an efficacious means of obtaining from God the graces they desired, provided they were for the greater good of their souls.<ref>[http://www.franciscan-sfo.org/ap/rac/francpaola.htm \"Devotion of the Thirteen Fridays\", The Raccolta]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[San Francesco di Paola, Naples]]\n\n{{portal bar|Biography|Catholicism|Saints|Italy}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{catholic|wstitle=St. Francis of Paola |author=Father Cuthbert |volume=6 |year=1913}}\n\n==Sources and external links==\n{{Commons category|Francis of Paola}}\n{{EB1911 Poster|Francis of Paola, St|Francis of Paola}}\n*[http://www.francescodipaola.info FrancescoDiPaola.info ], Official website\n*[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=645 Catholic.org], Online entry for Francis of Paola\n*Herbert Thurston, ''The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism,'' pp.&nbsp;174\u201375\n* [http://www.stpetersbasilica.info/Statues/Founders/FrancisdePaola/Francis%20de%20Paola.htm Founder Statue in St Peter's Basilica]\n* [http://www.stpetersbasilica.info/Exterior/Colonnades/Saints/St%20Francis%20of%20Paola-127/StFrancisofPaola.htm Colonnade Statue in St Peter's Square]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Francis Of Paola}}\n\n[[Category:1416 births]]\n[[Category:1507 deaths]]\n[[Category:15th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:15th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:16th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:16th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities]]\n[[Category:Italian hermits]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints]]\n[[Category:Incorrupt saints]]\n[[Category:Medieval Italian saints]]\n[[Category:Minims (religious order)]]\n[[Category:People from Paola, Calabria]]\n[[Category:Proto-vegans]]\n", "name_user": "Jackson Hamilton", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegacy and veneration", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Paola"}
