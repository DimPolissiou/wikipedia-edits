His nation lived in an area extending from [[Lake of Two Mountains]] to modern-day [[Pembroke, Ontario]].\n\nTessouat lived in [[L'Isle-aux-Allumettes, Quebec|L'Isle-aux-Allumettes]], in a neck of the Ottawa River. He was described by the French settlers as having a strong character. He was also blind in one eye (in French, borgne) and was dubbed \"le Borgne de l'isle\".  His position was highly strategic, as the Ottawa River was the safest way to go from the [[St. Lawrence River]] to [[Hudson Bay]] and to Huronia, near [[Georgian Bay]]. Tessouat took advantage of his position to impose some sort of customs duties on the French fur traders navigating on the Ottawa River, as well as to impose some of his authority. For example, in 1633, he refused to let the Jesuits go to Huronia, fearing he would lose authority in the region.  To maintain the economic supremacy of the Kitchisipirini, he made great efforts to keep his French, [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] (Huron), and [[Odawa people|Odawa]] allies from trading with each other directly, preferring that they trade through Algonquin middlemen.\n\nAt that time, the Algonquins, [[Wendats]], and several other Great Lakes First Nations were at war with the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. Yet, Tessouat initiated peace talks with the [[Mohawk nation]] and, in 1634, they agreed to a peace treaty.  The alleged motive behind this political move was to gain access to the Dutch settlers in what is now known the New York State, perhaps in order to be in a better negotiating position with the French traders.  Peace with the Mohawks only lasted two years  and Tessouat died a few months after bloody fights against the Mohawks.\n\nIn 1641, after Tessouat's death, in the fashion of an Algonquian custom, a new Tessouat was reborn. The custom consisted of bringing back to life an important dead chief in a highly spectacular ritual. The new Tessouat was brought to life to save the Kitchesipirini nation, which was by then afflicted by death, caused by the European diseases, and isolated after several losses to the Iroquian confederation. Strangely enough, the new Tessouat was also blind in one eye. This fact probably contributed to muddle the French, who sometimes did not distinguish the new Tessouat from the old one. To save his nation, the new Tessouat decided to move from the Ottawa River area to a place nearby the French. After going to Sillery (nearby Quebec), where the Wendats refused their hospitality, Tessouat decides to bring his nation to [[Montreal|Montreal island]], where he agrees to receive the Christian baptism. In 1647, fearing an attack from the [[Iroquois]] and suspecting that the French would not defend them, Tessouat and his nation moved again. The new Tessouat finally died at [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec|Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]], in 1654.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Remi Savard, ''L'Algonquin Tessouat et la fondation de Montr\u00e9al'' (Gallimard, 1996), {{ISBN|2-89006-560-X}}.\n* Jury, Elsie McLoed 1966 Tessouat (d. 1636) in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, Year of publication: 1966, revised edition: 1979<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jury |first1=Elsie McLeod |title=Tessouat (d. 1636) |url= http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/tessouat_1636_1E.html |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval |accessdate=18 April 2020 |ref=Volume 1}}</ref>\n* Jury, Elsie McLoed 1966 Tessouat (fl. 1603-13) in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, Year of publication: 1966, revised edition: 1979<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jury |first1=Elsie McLeod |title=Tessouat (fl. 1603-13) |url=  \thttp://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/tessouat_1603_13_1E.html |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval |accessdate=18 April 2020 |ref=Volume 1}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20050909032232/http://www.wilkesweb.us/algonquin/cac-nations.htm\n*http://radio-canada.ca/radio/profondeur/RemarquablesOublies/Tessouat.htm\n\n[[Category:Indigenous leaders in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Indigenous leaders in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Algonquin people]]\n[[Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)]]\n[[Category:17th-century Native Americans]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n'''Tessouat''' (''[[Anishinaabe language|Anishinaabe]]'':  '''Tesswehas''') ([[Circa|c.]] ??? &ndash; 1636/1654) was an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] chief from the [[Kitchesipirini]] nation (\"Kitche\"=Great, \"sipi\"=river, \"rini\"=people: the people from the great river, the [[Ottawa River]]).

[[Bing Gordon]] of Electronic Arts reported that customers used computers for games more than one fifth of the time whether purchased for work or a hobby, with many who purchased computers for other reasons finding PC games \"a pretty satisfying experience\".<ref name=\"halfhill198612\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_079_1986_Dec#page/n33/mode/2up | title=The MS-DOS Invasion / IBM Compatibles Are Coming Home | work=Compute! | date=December 1986 | access-date=9 November 2013 | author=Halfhill, Tom R. | pages=32}}</ref>\n\nBy 1987, the PC market was growing so quickly that the formerly business-only computer had become the largest and fastest-growing, and most important platform for computer game companies.

Increasing adoption of the [[computer mouse]], driven partially by the success of [[adventure game]]s such as the highly successful ''[[King's Quest]]'' series, and high resolution [[bitmap]] displays allowed the industry to include increasingly high-quality [[GUI|graphical interfaces]] in new releases.\n\nFurther improvements to game artwork and audio were made possible with the introduction of [[FM synthesis]] sound. [[Yamaha]] began manufacturing FM synth boards for computers in the early-mid-1980s, and by 1985, the NEC and [[FM-7]] computers had built-in FM sound.<ref name=\"hg101_retro\" /> The first PC [[sound card]]s, such as [[AdLib]]'s Music Synthesizer Card, soon appeared in 1987. These cards allowed [[IBM PC compatible]] computers to produce complex sounds using FM synthesis, where they had previously been limited to simple tones and beeps. However, the rise of the [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster]] card, released in 1989, which featured much higher sound quality due to the inclusion of a [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] channel and [[digital signal processor]], led AdLib to file for bankruptcy by 1992. Also in 1989, the [[FM Towns]] computer included built-in PCM sound, in addition to a CD-ROM drive and [[24-bit color]] graphics.<ref name=\"hg101_retro\" />\n\nBy 1990, [[DOS]] was 65% of the computer-game market, with the Amiga at 10%; all other computers, including the [[Apple Macintosh]], were below 10% and declining.

GPUs may be an integrated part of the computer's [[motherboard]], the most common solution in laptops,<ref name=\"integrated gpus\">{{cite web|url=http://hardware.earthweb.com/chips/article.php/3570161|title=Platform Trends: Mobile Graphics Heat Up|access-date=October 22, 2006|date=December 2005}}</ref> or come packaged with a discrete graphics card with a supply of dedicated [[Video RAM]], connected to the motherboard through either an [[accelerated graphics port|AGP]] or [[PCI-Express]] port. It is also possible to use multiple GPUs in a single computer, using technologies such as [[NVidia]]'s [[Scalable Link Interface]] and [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]'s [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]].\n\n[[Sound card]]s are also available to provide improved audio in computer games. These cards provide improved [[3D audio effect|3D audio]] and provide audio enhancement that is generally not available with integrated alternatives, at the cost of marginally lower overall performance.<ref name=\"soundcard performance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/1776/10|title=X-Fi and the Elite Pro: SoundBlaster's Return to Greatness|access-date=October 22, 2006|date=August 2005}}</ref> The [[Creative Labs]] [[SoundBlaster]] line was for many years the ''de facto'' standard for sound cards, although its popularity dwindled as PC audio became a commodity on modern motherboards.\n\n[[Physics processing unit]]s (PPUs), such as the [[Nvidia]] [[PhysX]] (formerly [[AGEIA]] PhysX) card, are also available to accelerate physics simulations in modern computer games. PPUs allow the computer to process more complex interactions among objects than is achievable using only the CPU, potentially allowing players a much greater degree of control over the world in games designed to use the card.<ref name=\"integrated gpus\" />\n\nVirtually all personal computers use a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]] for user input, but there are exceptions. During the 1990s, before the keyboard and mouse combination had become the method of choice for PC gaming input peripherals, there were other types of peripherals such as the [[Mad Catz]] [[Panther XL]], the [[First-Person Gaming]] [[Assassin 3D]], and the [[Mad Catz]] [[Panther (Video game controller)|Panther]], which combined a trackball for looking / aiming, and a joystick for movement. Other common gaming peripherals are a headset for faster communication in online games, [[joystick]]s for [[flight simulator]]s, [[steering wheel]]s for driving games and [[gamepad]]s for console-style games.\n\n=== Software ===\nComputer games also rely on [[Third-party software component|third-party]] software such as an [[Operating System|operating system (OS)]], [[device driver]]s, [[library (computing)|libraries]] and more to run. Today, the vast majority of computer games are designed to run on the [[Microsoft Windows]] family of operating systems. Whereas earlier games written for DOS would include code to communicate directly with hardware, today [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces (APIs)]] provide an interface between the game and the OS, simplifying game design. Microsoft's [[DirectX]] is an API that is widely used by today's computer games to communicate with sound and graphics hardware. [[OpenGL]] is a [[cross-platform]] API for graphics rendering that is also used. The version of the graphics card's [[device driver|driver]] installed can often affect game performance and [[gameplay]]. In late 2013, [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] announced [[Mantle (API)|Mantle]], a low-level API for certain models of AMD graphics cards, allowing for greater performance compared to software-level APIs such as DirectX, as well as simplifying [[porting]] to and from the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] consoles, which are both built upon AMD hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-mantle-api-gcn-battlefield-4,24418.html|title=AMD's Mantle API Gives Devs Direct Hardware Control|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> It is not unusual for a game company to use a third-party [[game engine]], or third-party libraries for a game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] or [[game physics|physics]].\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n{{Main|Multiplayer computer game}}\n\n==== Local area network gaming ====\n{{See also|LAN party}}\n\nMultiplayer gaming was largely limited to [[local area network]]s (LANs) before cost-effective [[broadband Internet access]] became available, due to their typically higher [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and lower [[latency (engineering)|latency]] than the dial-up services of the time. These advantages allowed more players to join any given computer game, but have persisted today because of the higher latency of most Internet connections and the costs associated with broadband Internet.\n\nLAN gaming typically requires two or more personal computers, a [[Router (computing)|router]] and sufficient networking cables to connect every computer on the network. Additionally, each computer must have its own copy (or [[Spawn installation|spawn copy]]) of the game in order to play. Optionally, any LAN may include an external connection to the Internet.\n\n==== Online games ====\n{{Main|Online game}}\n\nOnline multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely as a result of increasing [[broadband internet|broadband]] adoption among consumers. Affordable high-bandwidth Internet connections allow large numbers of players to play together, and thus have found particular use in [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, ''[[Tanarus (video game)|Tanarus]]'' and persistent online games such as ''[[World War II Online]]''.\n\nAlthough it is possible to participate in online computer games using dial-up [[modem]]s, broadband Internet connections are generally considered necessary in order to reduce the latency or \"lag\" between players. Such connections require a broadband-compatible modem connected to the personal computer through a [[network interface card]] (generally integrated onto the computer's [[motherboard]]), optionally separated by a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Online games require a virtual environment, generally called a \"game server\". These virtual servers inter-connect gamers, allowing real time, and often fast-paced action. To meet this subsequent need, [[Game server|Game Server Providers (GSP)]] have become increasingly more popular over the last half decade.{{When|date=February 2019}} While not required for all gamers, these servers provide a unique \"home\", fully customizable, such as additional modifications, settings, etc., giving the end gamers the experience they desire. Today there are over 510,000 game servers hosted in North America alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/stats/|title=Steam: Game and Player Statistics|website=store.steampowered.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{Main|Emulator}}\nEmulation software, used to run software without the original hardware, are popular for their ability to play legacy video games without the [[computing platform|platform]] for which they were designed. The operating system emulators include [[DOSBox]], a DOS emulator which allows playing games developed originally for this operating system and thus not compatible with a modern-day OS. Console emulators such as [[Nestopia]] and [[MAME]] are relatively commonplace, although the complexity of modern consoles such as the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] or [[PlayStation]] makes them far more difficult to emulate, even for the original manufacturers.<ref name=\"xboxemulation\">{{cite web| url = http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/xbox360_05.asp| title = Xbox 360 Review| access-date = September 12, 2006|date=November 2005}}</ref> The most technically advanced consoles that can currently be successfully emulated for commercial games on PC are the PlayStation 2 using [[PCSX2]], and the Nintendo Wii U using the [[Cemu]] emulator. A [[PlayStation 3]] emulator named RPCS3 is in development, although it can currently{{When|date=February 2019}} only run small [[Homebrew (video games)|Homebrew]] games and certain old arcade titles that were originally ported to the PS3 from older platforms.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://rpcs3.net/| title = Homepage of the RPCS3 PlayStation 3 Emulator project}}</ref>\n\nMost emulation software mimics a particular hardware architecture, often to an extremely high degree of accuracy. This is particularly the case with classic home computers such as the [[Commodore 64]], whose software often depends on highly sophisticated low-level programming tricks invented by game programmers and the [[demoscene]].\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Main|Video game controversy}}\nPC games have long been a source of controversy, largely due to the depictions of violence that has become commonly associated with video games in general. The debate surrounds the influence of objectionable content on the social development of [[minor (law)|minor]]s, with organizations such as the [[American Psychological Association]] concluding that video game violence increases children's aggression,<ref>{{cite web | author=[[American Psychological Association]] | url=http://www.psychologymatters.org/videogames.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803074007/http://www.psychologymatters.org/videogames.html | archivedate=August 3, 2008 | title= Violent Video Games \u2013 Psychologists Help Protect Children from Harmful Effects}}</ref> a concern that prompted a further investigation by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] in September 2006.<ref name=\"cvgaggressionresearch\">{{cite web| url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2006/09/7771.ars | title = Senate bill mandates CDC investigation into video game violence| access-date=September 19, 2006|date=September 2006}}</ref> Industry groups have responded by noting the responsibility of parents in governing their children's activities, while attempts in the United States to control the sale of objectionable games have generally been found unconstitutional.<ref name=\"freespeech\">{{cite web| url = https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/08/7597.ars| title = Judge rules against Louisiana video game law| access-date = September 2, 2006|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Game addiction|Video game addiction]] is another cultural aspect of gaming to draw criticism as it can have a negative influence on health and on social relations. The problem of addiction and its health risks seems to have grown with the rise of [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs)]].<ref name=\"cvgaddiction\">{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/03/health/webmd/main1773956.shtml\n| title = Detox For Video Game Addiction?| access-date = September 12, 2006|date=July 2006 | work=CBS News}}</ref> Alongside the social and health problems associated with computer game addiction have grown similar worries about the effect of computer games on education.<ref name=\"titleTom Maher discusses the effects of computer game addiction on classroom teaching\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/33-video-games-and-children |title=Tom Maher discusses the effects of computer game addiction on classroom teaching|publisher=dystalk.com |access-date=April 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Computer games museums ==\n{{See also|Video game#Museums}}\nThere are several computer games museums around the world. In 2011 one opened in Berlin, a computer game museum that documents computer games from the 1970s until today. The [[Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment]], in [[Oakland, California]] also exhibits PC games in its general collection. The Video Game Museum in Rome is dedicated to the preservation of videogames, and includes Pss games in its collection. The [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] holds a collection of PC games, and allows visitors to play ''[[Spacewar!]]'', the first computer game, on a restored original [[PDP-1|DEC PDP-1]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Video games}}\n* [[Arcade game]]\n* [[Console game]]\n* [[Game studies]]\n* [[Handheld game console]]\n* [[List of PC games]]\n* [[Mobile game]]\n* [[Split screen (video games)]]\n* [[Text-based game]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/index.php?lg=en Computer game museum in Berlin]\n\n{{Video game genre}}\n\n[[Category:Video game platforms]]\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Computer game|video games in general|video game|other uses|Computer game (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Video games}}\n\nA '''PC game''', also known as a '''computer game''' or '''personal computer game''', is a type of [[video game]] played on a [[personal computer]] rather than a [[video game console]] or [[arcade cabinet|arcade machine]].

However, the rise of the [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster]] card, released in 1989, which featured much higher sound quality due to the inclusion of a [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] channel and [[digital signal processor]], led AdLib to file for bankruptcy by 1992.

GPUs may be an integrated part of the computer's [[motherboard]], the most common solution in laptops,<ref name=\"integrated gpus\">{{cite web|url=http://hardware.earthweb.com/chips/article.php/3570161|title=Platform Trends: Mobile Graphics Heat Up|access-date=October 22, 2006|date=December 2005}}</ref> or come packaged with a discrete graphics card with a supply of dedicated [[Video RAM]], connected to the motherboard through either an [[accelerated graphics port|AGP]] or [[PCI-Express]] port. It is also possible to use multiple GPUs in a single computer, using technologies such as [[NVidia]]'s [[Scalable Link Interface]] and [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]'s [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]].\n\n[[Sound card]]s are also available to provide improved audio in computer games. These cards provide improved [[3D audio effect|3D audio]] and provide audio enhancement that is generally not available with integrated alternatives, at the cost of marginally lower overall performance.<ref name=\"soundcard performance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/1776/10|title=X-Fi and the Elite Pro: SoundBlaster's Return to Greatness|access-date=October 22, 2006|date=August 2005}}</ref> The [[Creative Labs]] [[SoundBlaster]] line was for many years the ''de facto'' standard for sound cards, although its popularity dwindled as PC audio became a commodity on modern motherboards.\n\n[[Physics processing unit]]s (PPUs), such as the [[Nvidia]] [[PhysX]] (formerly [[AGEIA]] PhysX) card, are also available to accelerate physics simulations in modern computer games. PPUs allow the computer to process more complex interactions among objects than is achievable using only the CPU, potentially allowing players a much greater degree of control over the world in games designed to use the card.<ref name=\"integrated gpus\" />\n\nVirtually all personal computers use a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]] for user input, but there are exceptions. During the 1990s, before the keyboard and mouse combination had become the method of choice for PC gaming input peripherals, there were other types of peripherals such as the [[Mad Catz]] [[Panther XL]], the [[First-Person Gaming]] [[Assassin 3D]], and the [[Mad Catz]] [[Panther (Video game controller)|Panther]], which combined a trackball for looking / aiming, and a joystick for movement. Other common gaming peripherals are a headset for faster communication in online games, [[joystick]]s for [[flight simulator]]s, [[steering wheel]]s for driving games and [[gamepad]]s for console-style games.\n\n=== Software ===\nComputer games also rely on [[Third-party software component|third-party]] software such as an [[Operating System|operating system (OS)]], [[device driver]]s, [[library (computing)|libraries]] and more to run. Today, the vast majority of computer games are designed to run on the [[Microsoft Windows]] family of operating systems. Whereas earlier games written for DOS would include code to communicate directly with hardware, today [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces (APIs)]] provide an interface between the game and the OS, simplifying game design. Microsoft's [[DirectX]] is an API that is widely used by today's computer games to communicate with sound and graphics hardware. [[OpenGL]] is a [[cross-platform]] API for graphics rendering that is also used. The version of the graphics card's [[device driver|driver]] installed can often affect game performance and [[gameplay]]. In late 2013, [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] announced [[Mantle (API)|Mantle]], a low-level API for certain models of AMD graphics cards, allowing for greater performance compared to software-level APIs such as DirectX, as well as simplifying [[porting]] to and from the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] consoles, which are both built upon AMD hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-mantle-api-gcn-battlefield-4,24418.html|title=AMD's Mantle API Gives Devs Direct Hardware Control|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=}}</ref> It is not unusual for a game company to use a third-party [[game engine]], or third-party libraries for a game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] or [[game physics|physics]].\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n{{Main|Multiplayer computer game}}\n\n==== Local area network gaming ====\n{{See also|LAN party}}\n\nMultiplayer gaming was largely limited to [[local area network]]s (LANs) before cost-effective [[broadband Internet access]] became available, due to their typically higher [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and lower [[latency (engineering)|latency]] than the dial-up services of the time. These advantages allowed more players to join any given computer game, but have persisted today because of the higher latency of most Internet connections and the costs associated with broadband Internet.\n\nLAN gaming typically requires two or more personal computers, a [[Router (computing)|router]] and sufficient networking cables to connect every computer on the network. Additionally, each computer must have its own copy (or [[Spawn installation|spawn copy]]) of the game in order to play. Optionally, any LAN may include an external connection to the Internet.\n\n==== Online games ====\n{{Main|Online game}}\n\nOnline multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely as a result of increasing [[broadband internet|broadband]] adoption among consumers. Affordable high-bandwidth Internet connections allow large numbers of players to play together, and thus have found particular use in [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, ''[[Tanarus (video game)|Tanarus]]'' and persistent online games such as ''[[World War II Online]]''.\n\nAlthough it is possible to participate in online computer games using dial-up [[modem]]s, broadband Internet connections are generally considered necessary in order to reduce the latency or \"lag\" between players. Such connections require a broadband-compatible modem connected to the personal computer through a [[network interface card]] (generally integrated onto the computer's [[motherboard]]), optionally separated by a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Online games require a virtual environment, generally called a \"game server\". These virtual servers inter-connect gamers, allowing real time, and often fast-paced action. To meet this subsequent need, [[Game server|Game Server Providers (GSP)]] have become increasingly more popular over the last half decade.{{When|date=February 2019}} While not required for all gamers, these servers provide a unique \"home\", fully customizable, such as additional modifications, settings, etc., giving the end gamers the experience they desire. Today there are over 510,000 game servers hosted in North America alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/stats/|title=Steam: Game and Player Statistics|website=store.steampowered.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{Main|Emulator}}\nEmulation software, used to run software without the original hardware, are popular for their ability to play legacy video games without the [[computing platform|platform]] for which they were designed. The operating system emulators include [[DOSBox]], a DOS emulator which allows playing games developed originally for this operating system and thus not compatible with a modern-day OS. Console emulators such as [[Nestopia]] and [[MAME]] are relatively commonplace, although the complexity of modern consoles such as the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] or [[PlayStation]] makes them far more difficult to emulate, even for the original manufacturers.<ref name=\"xboxemulation\">{{cite web| url = http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/xbox360_05.asp| title = Xbox 360 Review| access-date = September 12, 2006|date=November 2005}}</ref> The most technically advanced consoles that can currently be successfully emulated for commercial games on PC are the PlayStation 2 using [[PCSX2]], and the Nintendo Wii U using the [[Cemu]] emulator. A [[PlayStation 3]] emulator named RPCS3 is in development, although it can currently{{When|date=February 2019}} only run small [[Homebrew (video games)|Homebrew]] games and certain old arcade titles that were originally ported to the PS3 from older platforms.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://rpcs3.net/| title = Homepage of the RPCS3 PlayStation 3 Emulator project}}</ref>\n\nMost emulation software mimics a particular hardware architecture, often to an extremely high degree of accuracy. This is particularly the case with classic home computers such as the [[Commodore 64]], whose software often depends on highly sophisticated low-level programming tricks invented by game programmers and the [[demoscene]].\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Main|Video game controversy}}\nPC games have long been a source of controversy, largely due to the depictions of violence that has become commonly associated with video games in general. The debate surrounds the influence of objectionable content on the social development of [[minor (law)|minor]]s, with organizations such as the [[American Psychological Association]] concluding that video game violence increases children's aggression,<ref>{{cite web | author=[[American Psychological Association]] | url=http://www.psychologymatters.org/videogames.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803074007/http://www.psychologymatters.org/videogames.html | archivedate=August 3, 2008 | title= Violent Video Games \u2013 Psychologists Help Protect Children from Harmful Effects}}</ref> a concern that prompted a further investigation by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] in September 2006.<ref name=\"cvgaggressionresearch\">{{cite web| url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2006/09/7771.ars | title = Senate bill mandates CDC investigation into video game violence| access-date=September 19, 2006|date=September 2006}}</ref> Industry groups have responded by noting the responsibility of parents in governing their children's activities, while attempts in the United States to control the sale of objectionable games have generally been found unconstitutional.<ref name=\"freespeech\">{{cite web| url = https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/08/7597.ars| title = Judge rules against Louisiana video game law| access-date = September 2, 2006|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Game addiction|Video game addiction]] is another cultural aspect of gaming to draw criticism as it can have a negative influence on health and on social relations. The problem of addiction and its health risks seems to have grown with the rise of [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs)]].<ref name=\"cvgaddiction\">{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/03/health/webmd/main1773956.shtml\n| title = Detox For Video Game Addiction?| access-date = September 12, 2006|date=July 2006 | work=CBS News}}</ref> Alongside the social and health problems associated with computer game addiction have grown similar worries about the effect of computer games on education.<ref name=\"titleTom Maher discusses the effects of computer game addiction on classroom teaching\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/33-video-games-and-children |title=Tom Maher discusses the effects of computer game addiction on classroom teaching|publisher=dystalk.com |access-date=April 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Computer games museums ==\n{{See also|Video game#Museums}}\nThere are several computer games museums around the world. In 2011 one opened in Berlin, a computer game museum that documents computer games from the 1970s until today. The [[Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment]], in [[Oakland, California]] also exhibits PC games in its general collection. The Video Game Museum in Rome is dedicated to the preservation of videogames, and includes Pss games in its collection. The [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] holds a collection of PC games, and allows visitors to play ''[[Spacewar!]]'', the first computer game, on a restored original [[PDP-1|DEC PDP-1]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Video games}}\n* [[Arcade game]]\n* [[Console game]]\n* [[Game studies]]\n* [[Handheld game console]]\n* [[List of PC games]]\n* [[Mobile game]]\n* [[Split screen (video games)]]\n* [[Text-based game]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/index.php?lg=en Computer game museum in Berlin]\n\n{{Video game genre}}\n\n[[Category:Video game platforms]]\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Inwind", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGrowth of IBM PC gaming:link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game"}

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee examination from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee examination from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019. The lawsuit was settled on April 9, 2020, with the perpetrators fined several million yen and banned from future events related to the [[AKB48 Group]].\n\n==Incident==\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi alleged in her [[SHOWROOM (streaming service)|Showroom]] live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men (identified by press as two fans, one unemployed and the other an university student, both 25-year old<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html\n | title=\uff2e\uff27\uff34\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093 \u3001\u75372\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u66b4\u884c | language=ja | work=[[Niigata Nippo]] | date=2019-01-10| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513064058/https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html | archivedate=2019-05-13}}</ref>) after hiding in an apartment on the other side which was previously occupied by another member, had tried to break into her personal apartment as she was entering her apartment after prying open her door.

Additionally, she revealed the existence of still-unreleased voice recordings which contained other current members personally admitting to having had private relationship with the group to which the assailants belonged.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189290449158184963\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u30b9\u30dd\u30cb\u30c1\u3055\u3093\u304c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3082\u3046\u95a2\u308f\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u8a00\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u3054\u5b58\u77e5\u306e\u901a\u308a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306f\u30ea\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3092\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u76ee\u7dda\u3067\u3084\u308b\u306e\u3067\u76f8\u624b\u304c\u4f55\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3082\u307b\u307c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002AKB\u65b0\u805e\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3066\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3082\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306f\u305a\u306a\u306e\u306b\u9177\u3059\u304e\u308b }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189320193669029890\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u72ec\u5360\u5165\u624b\u3063\u3066\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u88c1\u5224\u8cc7\u6599\uff1f\u6a2a\u6d41\u3057\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f\u4ee5\u5916\u4f55\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f \u8972\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3089\u4f1a\u793e\u306b\u8b1d\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u306fSNS\u3067\u5acc\u304c\u3089\u305b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u8f9e\u3081\u3066\u304b\u3089\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u3084\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u79c1\u306e\u305b\u3044\u306b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3002\u3053\u3093\u306a\u4f1a\u793e\u3042\u308b\uff1f \u72af\u4eba\u3068\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u306f\u73fe\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u8a8d\u3081\u3066\u308b\u306e\u306b\u3002\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u305d\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189328855129116672\n |date=2020-10-30 |title=\u3044\u3084\u3001\u300c\u4ffa\u3082\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u6307\u5b9a\u3057\u30662\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u7e4b\u304c\u308a\u306e\u8a3c\u62e0ww\u300d\u3063\u3066\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u9001\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u3084\u3081\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30e9\u3057\u3066\u305f\u3051\u3069\u7b11\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f \u7686\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://hochi.news/articles/20191030-OHT1T50031.html | title= \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d\u52a0\u5bb3\u8005\u3068\u306e\u201c\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u2026\u73fe\u5f79\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u8a3c\u62e0\u97f3\u58f0\u6240\u6301\u3082\u793a\u5506  | language=ja | work=[[Sports Hochi]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref> AKS reportedly denied to the media that their side was responsible for leaking the material to the press<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/201910300000274.html\n | title=  \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u304c\u201c\u8a3c\u62e0\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u5426\u5b9a\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d | language=ja | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref>, as did the defendant side via a stream broadcast.

It can also be manifested in individuals in the form of cultural alienation.\n\n== Origin ==\nIn 1894, Australian [[bush poetry|bush poet]] [[Henry Lawson]] wrote in his preface to his ''Short Stories in Prose and Verse'':\n{{quote|The Australian writer, until he gets a \"[[London]] hearing,\" is only accepted as an imitator of some recognized English or American author; and, as soon as he shows signs of coming to the front, he is labelled \"The Australian [[Robert Southey|Southey]],\" \"The Australian [[Robert Burns|Burns]],\" or \"The Australian [[Bret Harte]],\" and lately, \"The Australian [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]].\" Thus no matter how original he may be, he is branded, at the very start, as a plagiarist, and by his own country, which thinks, no doubt, that it is paying him a compliment and encouraging him, while it is really doing him a cruel and an almost irreparable injury. But mark! As soon as the Southern writer goes \"home\" and gets some recognition in England, he is \"So-and-So, the well-known Australian author whose work has attracted so much attention in London lately\"; and we first hear of him by cable, even though he might have been writing at his best for ten years in Australia.<ref>Colin Rodrick (ed.) Henry Lawson, Autobiographical and Other Writings 1887\u20131922 ([[Angus & Robertson]], 1972) pp.108\u2013109</ref>}}\n\nThe term \"cultural cringe\" was coined in [[Australia]] after the Second World War by the [[Melbourne]] critic and social commentator [[A. A. Phillips]], and defined in an influential and highly controversial 1950 essay of the same name.<ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Arthur Angel | authorlink = A. A.

The implications of these insights potentially applied to all former colonial nations, and the essay is now recognised as a cornerstone in the development of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial theory]] in Australia. In essence, Phillips pointed out that the public widely assumed that anything produced by local dramatists, actors, musicians, artists and writers was necessarily deficient when compared against the works of their British and European counterparts.  In the words of the poet [[Chris Wallace-Crabbe]] (quoted by [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Expatriate Games | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Expatriate-games/2005/03/24/1111525276948.html | newspaper = [[The Age]] | date = 2005-03-25 | accessdate = 2007-01-17 }}</ref>), Australia was being made to rhyme with failure.  The only ways local arts professionals could build themselves up in public esteem was either to follow overseas fashions, or, more often, to spend a period of time working in Britain.<ref name=\"When London Calls\">{{cite book | last = Alomes | first = Stephen | title = When London Calls: The Expatriation of Australian Creative Artists to Britain | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999 | location = Melbourne | url = https://archive.org/details/whenlondoncalls00step | isbn = 0-521-62031-7 }}</ref><ref name=\"Once an Australian\">{{cite book | last = Britain | first = Ian | title = Once an Australian: Journeys with Barry Humphries, Clive James, Germaine Greer and Robert Hughes | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997 | location = Melbourne | url = https://archive.org/details/onceaustralianjo00brit | isbn = 0-19-553742-4 }}</ref>\n\nAs Lawson continued in his 1894 preface: \"The same paltry spirit tried to dispose of the greatest of modern short-story writers as 'The Californian Dickens', but America wasn't built that way \u2013 neither was Bret Harte!\" The cultural cringe of Australians and the cultural swagger of Americans reflects deep contrasts between the American and the Australian experiences of extricating themselves from English apron-strings.  Dealing specifically with Australia, Phillips pointed out that ''sport'' has been the only field in which ordinary people accepted that their nation was able to perform and excel internationally.  Indeed, while they prided themselves on the qualities of locally produced athletes and sportsmen, whom they invariably considered first rate, Australians behaved as if in more intellectual pursuits the nation generated only second-rate talent.

For several generations following the cessation of [[penal transportation]], many Australians felt a sense of shame about being descended from convicts, and many did not even attempt to investigate their families' origins for fear of finding convicts in their lineage. In recent decades community attitudes have changed, and many Australians with convict ancestors are now more comfortable investigating and discussing their past, wearing their forebears' status almost as a badge of pride. Colloquially, attempts by non-Australians to negatively connote convict pasts are laughed off by Australians, who are now more inclined to associate criminal forebears as evidence for the possession of more positively perceived Australian attributes such as [[anti-authoritarianism]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2008/2209906.htm The convict stain]  Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

But mark! As soon as the Southern writer goes \"home\" and gets some recognition in England, he is \"So-and-So, the well-known Australian author whose work has attracted so much attention in London lately\"; and we first hear of him by cable, even though he might have been writing at his best for ten years in Australia.<ref>Colin Rodrick (ed.)

The implications of these insights potentially applied to all former colonial nations, and the essay is now recognised as a cornerstone in the development of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial theory]] in Australia. In essence, Phillips pointed out that the public widely assumed that anything produced by local dramatists, actors, musicians, artists and writers was necessarily deficient when compared against the works of their British and European counterparts.  In the words of the poet [[Chris Wallace-Crabbe]] (quoted by [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Expatriate Games | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Expatriate-games/2005/03/24/1111525276948.html | newspaper = [[The Age]] | date = 2005-03-25 | accessdate = 2007-01-17 }}</ref>), Australia was being made to rhyme with failure.

Dealing specifically with Australia, Phillips pointed out that ''sport'' has been the only field in which ordinary people accepted that their nation was able to perform and excel internationally.  Indeed, while they prided themselves on the qualities of locally produced athletes and sportsmen, whom they invariably considered first rate, Australians behaved as if in more intellectual pursuits the nation generated only second-rate talent.

For several generations following the cessation of [[penal transportation]], many Australians felt a sense of shame about being descended from convicts, and many did not even attempt to investigate their families' origins for fear of finding convicts in their lineage. In recent decades community attitudes have changed, and many Australians with convict ancestors are now more comfortable investigating and discussing their past, wearing their forebears' status almost as a badge of pride. Colloquially, attempts by non-Australians to negatively connote convict pasts are laughed off by Australians, who are now more inclined to associate criminal forebears as evidence for the possession of more positively perceived Australian attributes such as [[anti-authoritarianism]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2008/2209906.htm The convict stain]  Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
