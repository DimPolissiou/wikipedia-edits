After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider it at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. In an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider it at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. In an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

It was directed by [[Jeff Tremaine]], who produced with [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Spike Jonze]]. The film stars Johnny Knoxville, [[Bam Margera]], [[Steve-O]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Jason \"Wee Man\" Acu\u00f1a]], [[Preston Lacy]], [[Chris Pontius]], [[Ehren McGhehey]], and [[Dave England]]. This is the last Jackass film to feature Dunn before his death in 2011.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] released the film on October 15, 2010, to American theaters and marked the 10th anniversary of the franchise, which started in 2000. ''Jackass 3D'' earned $171.7 million on a $20 million budget. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] versions of ''Jackass 3D'' were released on March 8, 2011, in three different versions.\n\nA sequel titled ''Jackass 3.5'' was released on June 13, 2011.

DO NOT DO A SUMMARY OF EACH STUNT IN THE MOVIE -->\n[[Beavis and Butt-head]] introduced the film by explaining 3D technology. The opening sequence features the cast lining up and then being attacked by various objects in [[slow-motion]]. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with [[Vision Research Phantom|Phantom high speed cameras]] which shoot at 1,000 frames per second.\n\n''Jackass 3D'' follows the same premise of the previous movies and the television series. It is a compilation of various pranks, stunts and skits, and has no plot. Some of the stunts featured included [[tether ball]] being played with a [[beehive]] filled with [[Africanized bee]]s, one of [[Ehren McGhehey]]'s teeth being pulled out with a [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago]], using super mighty [[glue]] to take off chest hair and much more. The final stunt includes [[Steve-O]] being launched in the air while inside a [[portable toilet]] (which was achieved by connecting the port-a-potty to bungee cords) filled with [[excrement]].\n\nThe closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, but uses explosions as objects are thrown at the cast to the tune of Tchaikovsky's [[1812 Overture]]. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two ''Jackass'' films, comedian [[Rip Taylor]] makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion.

It was directed by [[Jeff Tremaine]], who produced with [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Spike Jonze]]. The film stars Johnny Knoxville, [[Bam Margera]], [[Steve-O]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Jason \"Wee Man\" Acu\u00f1a]], [[Preston Lacy]], [[Chris Pontius]], [[Ehren McGhehey]], and [[Dave England]]. This was the last Jackass film to feature Dunn before his death in 2011.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] released the film on October 15, 2010, to American theaters and marked the 10th anniversary of the franchise, which started in 2000. ''Jackass 3D'' earned $171.7 million on a $20 million budget. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] versions of ''Jackass 3D'' were released on March 8, 2011, in three different versions.\n\nA sequel titled ''Jackass 3.5'' was released on June 13, 2011.

DO NOT DO A SUMMARY OF EACH STUNT IN THE MOVIE -->\n[[Beavis and Butt-head]] introduced the film by explaining 3D technology. The opening sequence features the cast lining up and then being attacked by various objects in [[slow-motion]]. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with [[Vision Research Phantom|Phantom high speed cameras]] which shoot at 1,000 frames per second.\n\n''Jackass 3D'' follows the same premise of the previous movies and the television series. It is a compilation of various pranks, stunts and skits, and has no plot. Some of the stunts featured included [[tether ball]] being played with a [[beehive]] filled with [[Africanized bee]]s, one of [[Ehren McGhehey]]'s teeth being pulled out with a [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago]], using super mighty [[glue]] to take off chest hair and much more. The final stunt includes [[Steve-O]] being launched in the air while inside a [[portable toilet]] (which was achieved by connecting the port-a-potty to bungee cords) filled with [[excrement]].\n\nThe closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, but uses explosions as objects are thrown at the cast to the tune of Tchaikovsky's [[1812 Overture]]. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two ''Jackass'' films, comedian [[Rip Taylor]] makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion. As the ending credits play, a retrospective is shown with clips from the [[Jackass (TV series)|original show]] along with old photographs of cast and crew set to [[Weezer]]'s \"[[Memories (Weezer song)|Memories]]\", the film's single. Knoxville's daughter, Madison, is also seen in the ending credits, joining in on the prank fun.\n\n==Cast==\nThe entire cast from the previous movies returned for the third movie, with the notable exceptions of former Jackass mainstays [[Brandon DiCamillo]] and [[Raab Himself]].\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]]\n* [[Bam Margera]]\n* [[Steve-O]]\n* [[Ryan Dunn]]\n* [[Wee Man]]\n* [[Preston Lacy]]\n* [[Chris Pontius]]\n* [[Danger Ehren]]\n* [[Dave England]]\nGuest appearances:\n* [[The Dudesons]]\n* [[Loomis Fall]]\n* [[Brandon Novak]]\n* [[Britney Spears]]\n* [[April Margera]] and [[Phil Margera]]\n* [[Rake Yohn]]\n* [[Terra Jole]]\n* [[Mike Judge]] (as the voices of [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-head]])\n* [[Will Oldham]]\n* [[Rip Taylor]]\n* [[Half Pint Brawlers]]\n* Will the Farter\n* Animal experts [[Manny Puig]], David Weathers, and Jason Deeringer\n* American Football players [[Erik Ainge]], [[Jared Allen]], and [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]]\n* Extreme sport athletes [[Mat Hoffman]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[CKY Crew#Kerry Gets|Kerry Getz]], [[Eric Koston]] and [[Parks Bonifay]]\n* Actors [[Seann William Scott]], [[Edward Barbanell]], John Taylor and Angie Simms\n* From ''[[Nitro Circus]]'', [[Andy Bell (freestyle motocross rider)|Andy Bell]], Erik Roner and Tommy \"Streetbike Tommy\" Passemante\n* From [[Weezer]], [[Rivers Cuomo]], [[Brian Bell]] and [[Scott Shriner]]\n\nLike in the past films and the show, crew members [[Jeff Tremaine]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[Rick Kosick]], [[Lance Bangs]], [[Dimitry Elyashkevich]], Sean Cliver, Greg Iguchi and Trip Taylor along with [[Seth Meisterman]], make an appearance in the movie.

The University of Rio Grande do Norte, installed in a solemn session held at Teatro Alberto Maranh\u00e3o, on March 21, 1959, it was formed from colleges and schools of higher education already existing in Natal, such as the College of Pharmacy and Dentistry; the College of Law; the College of Medicine; the College of Engineering, among others.\n\nFrom 1968, with the university reform, UFRN went through a reorganization process that marked the end of the faculties and the consolidation of the current structure, that is, the grouping of several departments that, depending on the nature of the courses and disciplines, organized in Academic Centers.\n\nIn the 1970s, the construction of the Central Campus began, in an area of 123 hectares. The campus currently houses a bold architectural complex, surrounded by a ring road that integrates it with the urban fabric of the city of Natal.\n\nThe UFRN structure was modified, again, by means of a 1974 Decree (N \u00b0 74,211), constituting, also, from then on, the University Council (CONSUNI), the Teaching, Research and Extension Council (CONSEPE), Board of Trustees (CONCURA) and Rectory.\n\nA reform of the UFRN Statute, completed in 1996, established the structure in force today at the University, adding to the existing councils the Board of Directors (CONSAD) and creating, in the academic structure, the Specialized Academic Units and the Interdisciplinary Studies Centers. In addition to the various classes, laboratories and libraries, the Central Campus has a Community Center with a restaurant, bank branches, bookstores, art gallery and post office. The Rector's Office, the Pro-Rectories and all sectors of the Central Administration function in the Rectory building. \n\nUFRN's major events usually take place in Pra\u00e7a C\u00edvica, designed in the form of a large open-air amphitheater, where great shows also take place. For sports events and practices, the campus has a multi-sport park, with an Olympic gymnasium, soccer field, athletics track and Olympic pools.\n\nCurrently, UFRN offers, between undergraduate and graduate courses, more than 200 training opportunities. Its academic community is made up of more than 43,000 students and around 5,500 civil servants, including technical-administrative and permanent teachers, in addition to substitute and visiting professors.\n\n== CERES ==\n[[File:Escola Multicampi de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas de Caic\u00f3-RN.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|196x196px|EMCM entrance in the [[Caic\u00f3]] campus]]\n\nThe Serid\u00f3 Higher Education Center (CERES) of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte is formed by the university campuses of Caic\u00f3 and Currais Novos. Its academic structure is formed by eight Departments that offer thirteen on-campus undergraduate courses and two master's courses - Professional Masters in Letters - PROFLETRAS and the Professional Master in Geography - GEOPROF.\n\nIn Caic\u00f3, the academic departments are: Department of Law, Department of Education, Department of History, Department of Geography, Department of Exact and Applied Sciences and the Department of Computing and Technology. In Currais Novos, the Department of Social and Human Sciences and the Department of Letters operate.\n\nThe undergraduate courses in the face-to-face modality are: in Caic\u00f3, degrees in Geography, History, Mathematics and Pedagogy, and in Currais Novos Letras / Spanish and Letras Portugu\u00eas / Literatura. Within the scope of the bachelor's degree, we have 07 courses, of which 05 work in Caic\u00f3: Accounting, Law, Geography, History and Information Systems and 02 work in Currais Novos: Administration and Tourism.\n\nCERES also has support centers from the Secretariat of Distance Education (SEDIS) that offer distance learning courses. There are 17 undergraduate courses, of which 08 work in Caic\u00f3 and 09 work in Currais Novos. Thus, on the campus of Caic\u00f3, there are degrees in Biological Sciences, Physical Education, Geography, Literature, Pedagogy and Chemistry, and bachelor's degrees in Administration and Technologist in Public Management. On the campus of Currais Novos, there are degrees in Biological Sciences, Physical Education, Physics, Literature, Mathematics, Pedagogy and Chemistry and bachelor's degrees in Public Administration and Technologist in Public Management.\n\n=== EMCM ===\nThe Multicampi School of Medical Sciences of Rio Grande do Norte's mission is to promote medical training of excellence, supported by the social commitment to contribute to the innovation of health services and the progressive improvement of the population's quality of life. It is proposed to train doctors inserted in the health network in the countryside of the state, linked to the social reality of the population, capable of combining qualified technical-scientific training with ethical-humanistic attitudes that enable them to work as a team and positively impact the current reality. The course seeks to train suitable professionals to work effectively in the labor market, particularly in the rural context and outside large urban centers, valuing the health needs of our population and their ethical and cultural value.\n\n== School of Agriculture and Technology of Jundia\u00ed ==\n[[File:Escola agr\u00edcola de jundia\u00ed.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|Main entrance of the School of Agriculture and Technology of Jundia\u00ed]]\nThe Escola Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed was created by law No. 202 of December 1949, as \"Escola Pr\u00e1tica de Agricultura\", located in the former Fazenda Jundia\u00ed, 3 km from the municipality of [[Maca\u00edba]], and 25 km from the State capital [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal.]]\n\nThe Escola Pr\u00e1tica de Agricultura was transformed into \"Escola Agrot\u00e9cnica de Jundia\u00ed\", by the agreement signed between the state of [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and the Ministry of Agriculture, on April 9, 1954, being subordinate to the Ministry of Agricultural and Veterinary Education of that Ministry .\n\nPursuant to Decree No. 61,162, of August 16, 1967, it was incorporated into the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte]], later renaming it Col\u00e9gio Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed - CAJ.\n\nThe transfer of the School to the UFRN aimed, among other objectives, at implementing the Agronomy Course on its physical basis, which did not happen.\n\nWith Resolution No. 006/2002 - CONSUNI, of August 16, 2002, which approved modifications and alterations to the UFRN General Regulation, the Unit receives the current name of Escola Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed.\n\nOn December 19, 2007, through Resolution No. 11/2007 - CONSUNI, the Escola Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed changed from being a Supplementary Organ to a Specialized Academic Unit in Agrarian Sciences, integrated with the academic and administrative structure of UFRN.\n\nIt is defined under the terms of Art. 9 of the UFRN Statute, as a unit of teaching, research and extension activities in Agrarian Sciences, and aims at the integration between its various sub-areas of knowledge by improving the teaching provided, which requires structuring bases and groups and research aimed especially at the technological development of agro-food and agro-industrial production chains.\n\nThe intention expressed in Art. 2 of the aforementioned Resolution is that the Academic Unit will become, in the medium and long term, a Center of Excellence in Agricultural Sciences, which requires the implementation of new technological training courses at medium levels, undergraduate and graduate courses in the same area of knowledge.\n<br />\n== Academics ==\n[[File:Mapa do Campus.png|thumb|Map of the [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] Campus|303x303px|alt=]]In the 1970s, construction began on the Central Campus between the districts of Lagoa Nova, Capim Macio and Nova Descoberta, which houses most of the university's facilities in the capital.
