The city was often a point of escape for slaves to the north, as Indiana was a free state.\n\nDuring this point in the 1850s, the city was growing and vibrant, but that also came with negativity.

In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the [[Curtiss-Wright]] Aircraft Company, a war plant located at Louisville's air field, for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the [[C-46 Commando]] cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946, the factory was sold to [[International Harvester]], which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment.

This lead, in part, made Louisville seem like a more racially progressive city than other southern cities, though only when black citizens accepted a lower status than white citizens. Many historians have referred to this \"veil\" of segregation as a [[Covert racism|\"polite\" racism]]. Historian George Wright stating that polite racism \"often deluded both blacks and well-meaning whites into believing that real progress was being made in their city\". For example, in the city [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices were not maintained by law so much as by custom.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSimilar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to decline economically as many local factories closed.\n[[File:Louisville Fourthstreetlive.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Fourth Street Live!]], featuring marquee of the [[Hard Rock Cafe]]]]\n\nIn 1974, a major (F4) tornado hit Louisville as part of the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] of tornadoes that struck 13 states.

In more recent times, Louisville has become an international hub for [[Cargo airline|air cargo]].\n[[File:Kennedy Interchange Photo Diagram.JPG|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Kennedy Interchange]] (\"Spaghetti Junction\"), prior to the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]]]]\n\nLouisville has inner and outer [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] beltways, [[Interstate 264 (Kentucky)|I{{nbhyph}}264]] and [[Interstate 265|I{{nbhyph}}265]] respectively. Interstates [[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}64]] and [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}65]] pass through Louisville, and [[Interstate 71#Kentucky|I-71]] has its southern terminus in Louisville. Since all three of these highways intersect at virtually the same location on the east side of [[downtown Louisville|downtown]], this spot has become known as \"[[Kennedy Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]]\". Two bridges carry I{{nbhyph}}64 and I{{nbhyph}}65 over the Ohio River, and a [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge|third automobile bridge]] carries non-interstate traffic, including bicyclists and pedestrians. Immediately east of downtown is the [[Big Four Bridge]], a former railroad bridge now renovated as a pedestrian bridge.\n\nThe [[Ohio River Bridges Project]], a plan under consideration for decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti Junction, began construction in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |author=Collier, Rachel |title=Construction to begin soon on The Ohio River Bridges Project |url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19370142/construction-to-begin-soon-on-the-ohio-river-bridges-project |publisher=[[WDRB]] |date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref> One bridge, the [[Abraham Lincoln Bridge]], is located downtown beside the existing [[John F.

The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] was once headquartered here, before it was purchased by [[CSX Transportation]].

The factory produced the [[C-46 Commando]] cargo plane, among other aircraft.

Many historians have referred to this \"veil\" of segregation as a [[Covert racism|\"polite\" racism]].

Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing.

ECA&D has attained the status of [[Regional Climate Centre]] for high-resolution observation data in [[World Meteorological Organization]] Region VI (Europe and the Middle East)].\n\nThe objective of ECA&D is to monitor and analyze [[climate]] and [[climate change|changes in climate]] with a focus on climate extremes while making the data publicly available to download. Included in the database is a collection of [[Time series|daily series]] observations obtained from climatological divisions of [[National Meteorological and Hydrological Services]] (NMHSs), observatories and research centres throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. The daily series of observations is combined with [[Automated Quality control of meteorological observations|quality control]] and analysis of extremes via climate change indices.<ref>Klein\u2013Tank et al.,[http://www.knmi.nl/publications/fulltexts/kleintank_2002.pdf \"Daily dataset of 20th-century surface air temperature and precipitation series for the European climate assessment\", ''Int.

These participants contribute daily, quality controlled data from (a subset) of their national meteorological station networks. In order to ensure that each station's time series are as complete as possible, the database contains an automated update procedure that relies on daily data from [[SYNOP|SYNOP (surface synoptic observations)]] messages that are distributed in near real-time over the [[Global Telecommunication System]] (GTS). Any gaps in data are infilled with observations from nearby stations, provided they are within a {{convert|25|km|mi}} distance radius and within a height range of less than {{convert|50|m|ft}}. These series are referred to as '''blended''' series and are used for calculating the ECA&D indices of extremes ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#Indices of extremes|see below]]) and are also used in the E\u2013OBS daily gridded observational dataset ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#E\u2013OBS daily gridded dataset|see below]]).\n\nParticipation in ECA&D is open to anyone maintaining daily station data.\n\n==Data availability==\n[[File:data availability precip update.png|300px|thumb|right|ECA&D data availability for precipitation.

Green dots: data freely available; red dots: in database but ECA&D is not at liberty to distribute.]]\n\nData is available for the following elements:\n* [[Temperature]]\n** Mean temperature\n** Maximum temperature\n** Minimum temperature\n* [[Cloud cover]]\n* [[Humidity]]\n* [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation amount]]\n* [[Wind]]\n** [[Wind Speed|Wind speed]]\n** [[Wind|Wind gust]]\n** [[Wind direction]]\n* [[Insolation|Sunshine]]\n* [[Snow gauge|Snow depth]]\n* [[Atmospheric pressure|Pressure]]\n\nAs of June 2010, the number of stations providing data involving temperature is on the order of 1500, and nearly 3000 stations contribute precipitation data. In contrast, the number of stations currently providing data for the other elements ranges from approximately 150 (wind direction) to 900 (snow depth). Data collection for the elements other than temperature and precipitation began later so the data availability is lower; however the number of stations contributing these data is rapidly increasing. In measuring these elements, nearly all countries follow the climatological practices guidelines outlined by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. Element identification is given for all series including those provided by countries which do not follow these guidelines.\n\n===Metadata===\n[[File:de bilt photo.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Station De Bilt, The Netherlands]]\n\nIn order to achieve the most correct interpretation of observations, [[metadata]] is collected for each station in the ECA&D database. Apart from the standard [[longitude]], [[latitude]] and [[elevation]], ECA&D collects other metadata as well. This includes the [[Location identifier#WMO station identifiers|World Meteorological Organization station identifiers]] and whether or not the station is part of the [[Global Climate Observing System]]. Other examples of metadata are the land use around the observing area, soil type, surface coverage, station relocations and/or instrument changes. A photograph of the observing site may be included as well.\n\n==Indices of extremes==\nUsing the daily data, a total of 48 indices are calculated for every ECA&D station. Each index describes a particular characteristic of [[climate change]] for both changes in the mean and changes in the extremes. A core set of 26 indices follows the definitions recommended by the [[Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices]] and are calculated in similar ways as in other regions of the world. An additional set of 22 indices highlights particular characteristics of climate change in Europe.<ref name = \"Albert\">Albert Klein\u2013Tank, [http://www.ecad.eu/documents/ecad_atbd.pdf{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) [http://www.ecad.eu/documents/ecad_atbd.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2011 }}ECA&D Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)]. Retrieved on 2010-01-29.</ref>\n\nThe calculated indices fall into the following categories:\n* Cold\n* Drought\n* Heat\n* Pressure\n* Rain\n* Snow\n* Sun\n* Temperature\n\nSome indices are expressed via a fixed threshold and others are based on percentiles.  Fixed threshold indices describe a particular criteria such as the number of frost days that the minimum temperature is below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, or as another example, the number of heavy precipitation days that the precipitation sum exceeds {{convert|10|mm|in}}.  [[Percentile]] indices describe the case in which a value of a variable falls above a certain percentage, such as the number of days that the precipitation sum exceeds the 75th, 95th or 99th percentile.\n\nThe station series used for index calculations are '''blended''' series ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#Participants|see above]]).  They are made by utilizing the most recent data from synoptical messages distributed over the Global Telecommunication System (GTS).  Any gaps in data are infilled with observations from nearby stations, provided they are within a {{convert|25|km|mi}} distance radius and within a height range of less than {{convert|50|m|ft}}.  Information on the underlying series that are used in the blending process is provided for each blended series.  The blended series for temperature and precipitation have also been tested for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#Quality control and homogeneity|see below]]).  Additional information regarding the blending process can be found in the ECA&D Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document.<ref name=\"Albert\"/>\n\n==Quality control and homogeneity==\nSeries of the best possible quality are provided for ECA&D by the participating institutions.  However, even with careful data validation, it can never be excluded that some errors remain undetected.  The risk of such errors is greatest in the recent data that stem from synoptical messages.  Thus, ''all'' series in ECA&D (both non-blended and blended) are [[Automated Quality control of meteorological observations|quality controlled]], and all blended temperature and precipitation series are checked for inhomogeneities.\n\nThe quality control procedures lead to each data being flagged as either \"OK\", \"suspect\" or \"missing\" and homogeneity testing results in the classification of series as \"useful\", \"doubtful\" or \"suspect\".  It is recommended to use the results of the homogeneity tests for selecting appropriate series and time intervals since the \"useful\", \"doubtful\" and \"suspect\" categories only hold for the particular time interval for which the tests are applied.  Information on the specifics of quality control and homogeneity procedures can be found in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document <ref name=\"Albert\"/> and elsewhere.<ref>Wijngaard et al.,[http://www.knmi.nl/publications/fulltexts/wijngaard_2003_copy1.pdf Homogeneity of 20th century European daily temperature and precipitation series], ''Int.

ECA&D has attained the status of [[Regional Climate Centre]] for high-resolution observation data in [[World Meteorological Organization]] Region VI (Europe and the Middle East)].\n\nThe objective of ECA&D is to monitor and analyze [[climate]] and [[climate change|changes in climate]] with a focus on climate extremes while making the data publicly available to download. Included in the database is a collection of [[Time series|daily series]] observations obtained from climatological divisions of [[National Meteorological and Hydrological Services]] (NMHSs), observatories and research centres throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.

These participants contribute daily, quality controlled data from (a subset) of their national meteorological station networks. In order to ensure that each station's time series are as complete as possible, the database contains an automated update procedure that relies on daily data from [[SYNOP|SYNOP (surface synoptic observations)]] messages that are distributed in near real-time over the [[Global Telecommunication System]] (GTS). Any gaps in data are infilled with observations from nearby stations, provided they are within a {{convert|25|km|mi}} distance radius and within a height range of less than {{convert|50|m|ft}}. These series are referred to as '''blended''' series and are used for calculating the ECA&D indices of extremes ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#Indices of extremes|see below]]) and are also used in the E\u2013OBS daily gridded observational dataset ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#E\u2013OBS daily gridded dataset|see below]]).\n\nParticipation in ECA&D is open to anyone maintaining daily station data.\n\n==Data availability==\n[[File:data availability precip update.png|300px|thumb|right|ECA&D data availability for precipitation.

Green dots: data freely available; red dots: in database but ECA&D is not at liberty to distribute.]]\n\nData is available for the following elements:\n* [[Temperature]]\n** Mean temperature\n** Maximum temperature\n** Minimum temperature\n* [[Cloud cover]]\n* [[Humidity]]\n* [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation amount]]\n* [[Wind]]\n** [[Wind Speed|Wind speed]]\n** [[Wind|Wind gust]]\n** [[Wind direction]]\n* [[Insolation|Sunshine]]\n* [[Snow gauge|Snow depth]]\n* [[Atmospheric pressure|Pressure]]\n\nAs of June 2010, the number of stations providing data involving temperature is on the order of 1500, and nearly 3000 stations contribute precipitation data. In contrast, the number of stations currently providing data for the other elements ranges from approximately 150 (wind direction) to 900 (snow depth). Data collection for the elements other than temperature and precipitation began later so the data availability is lower; however the number of stations contributing these data is rapidly increasing. In measuring these elements, nearly all countries follow the climatological practices guidelines outlined by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. Element identification is given for all series including those provided by countries which do not follow these guidelines.\n\n===Metadata===\n[[File:de bilt photo.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Station De Bilt, The Netherlands]]\n\nIn order to achieve the most correct interpretation of observations, [[metadata]] is collected for each station in the ECA&D database. Apart from the standard [[longitude]], [[latitude]] and [[elevation]], ECA&D collects other metadata as well. This includes the [[Location identifier#WMO station identifiers|World Meteorological Organization station identifiers]] and whether or not the station is part of the [[Global Climate Observing System]]. Other examples of metadata are the land use around the observing area, soil type, surface coverage, station relocations and/or instrument changes. A photograph of the observing site may be included as well.\n\n==Indices of extremes==\nUsing the daily data, a total of 48 indices are calculated for every ECA&D station. Each index describes a particular characteristic of [[climate change]] for both changes in the mean and changes in the extremes. A core set of 26 indices follows the definitions recommended by the [[Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices]] and are calculated in similar ways as in other regions of the world. An additional set of 22 indices highlights particular characteristics of climate change in Europe.<ref name = \"Albert\">Albert Klein\u2013Tank, [http://www.ecad.eu/documents/ecad_atbd.pdf{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) [http://www.ecad.eu/documents/ecad_atbd.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2011 }}ECA&D Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)]. Retrieved on 2010-01-29.</ref>\n\nThe calculated indices fall into the following categories:\n* Cold\n* Drought\n* Heat\n* Pressure\n* Rain\n* Snow\n* Sun\n* Temperature\n\nSome indices are expressed via a fixed threshold and others are based on percentiles.  Fixed threshold indices describe a particular criteria such as the number of frost days that the minimum temperature is below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, or as another example, the number of heavy precipitation days that the precipitation sum exceeds {{convert|10|mm|in}}.  [[Percentile]] indices describe the case in which a value of a variable falls above a certain percentage, such as the number of days that the precipitation sum exceeds the 75th, 95th or 99th percentile.\n\nThe station series used for index calculations are '''blended''' series ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#Participants|see above]]).  They are made by utilizing the most recent data from synoptical messages distributed over the Global Telecommunication System (GTS).  Any gaps in data are infilled with observations from nearby stations, provided they are within a {{convert|25|km|mi}} distance radius and within a height range of less than {{convert|50|m|ft}}.  Information on the underlying series that are used in the blending process is provided for each blended series.  The blended series for temperature and precipitation have also been tested for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] ([[European Climate Assessment and Dataset#Quality control and homogeneity|see below]]).  Additional information regarding the blending process can be found in the ECA&D Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document.<ref name=\"Albert\"/>\n\n==Quality control and homogeneity==\nSeries of the best possible quality are provided for ECA&D by the participating institutions.  However, even with careful data validation, it can never be excluded that some errors remain undetected.  The risk of such errors is greatest in the recent data that stem from synoptical messages.  Thus, ''all'' series in ECA&D (both non-blended and blended) are [[Automated Quality control of meteorological observations|quality controlled]], and all blended temperature and precipitation series are checked for inhomogeneities.\n\nThe quality control procedures lead to each data being flagged as either \"OK\", \"suspect\" or \"missing\" and homogeneity testing results in the classification of series as \"useful\", \"doubtful\" or \"suspect\".

Although Bowlby, Bomer, and Fraser reprise their roles from the DC Universe series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'', the two shows are set in separate continuities.\n\nFilming began in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in late August 2018, and the first season premiered on February 15, 2019. In July 2019, the series was renewed for a second season, which is set to premiere in 2020 on both DC Universe and [[HBO Max]].{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doom Patrol'' follows the unlikely heroes of [[Doom Patrol|the eponymous team]] who all received their powers through tragic circumstances and are generally shunned by society. Most members of the team were treated by [[Chief (comics)|the Chief]], a medical doctor who gave them residence in his mansion to help protect them from the outside world. Their name derives from an earlier Doom Patrol team that was formed by the Chief.\n\nThe first members of the Doom Patrol to be introduced in the series are [[Crazy Jane|Jane]], the dominant personality of a traumatized woman with [[dissociative identity disorder]]; [[Elasti-Girl|Rita Farr]], who struggles to prevent her body from turning to a gelatinous state; [[Negative Man|Larry Trainor]], who has an entity of negative energy living inside of him; and [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Cliff Steele]], whose brain was placed in a robot body following a car accident. The team is later joined by cybernetically-enhanced superhero [[Cyborg (comics)|Vic Stone]].\n\nIn the first season, the Chief is captured by the malevolent [[Mr. Nobody (comics)|Mr. Nobody]], sending the Doom Patrol on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, they discover secrets about themselves and of the Chief, whom they eventually learn is responsible for the tragic events that gave them their powers.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Diane Guerrero]] as [[Crazy Jane|Jane]]: The dominant personality of Kay Challis, a young woman who developed 64 distinct personalities from trauma she experienced as a child and received powers for each personality from an experiment she was involuntarily subjected to.<ref name=\"Guerrero\">{{cite web |last1=Otterson |first1=Joe |title=''Orange Is the New Black'' Star Diane Guerrero Joins ''Doom Patrol'' Series at DC Universe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/doom-patrol-dc-universe-diane-gurrero-1202890215/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 30, 2018 |date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731003003/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/doom-patrol-dc-universe-diane-gurrero-1202890215/ |archive-date=July 31, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Inside Kay's subconsciousness, Guerrero also plays Driver 8 and Karen, while Anna Lore plays Penny Farthing, Stephanie Czajkowski plays Hammerhead, [[Tara Lee]] plays Lucy Fugue, Chelsea Alana Rivera plays Silver Tongue, Hannah Alline plays Pretty Polly, Jackie Goldston plays the Secretary, [[Monica Louwerens]] plays the Weird Sisters, and Helen Abell plays [[Black Annis]].

The current team learns that Caulder assembled and led the original Doom Patrol, but they disbanded after being defeated by Mr. Nobody. Steve, Arani, and Rhea are also revealed to be old and mentally ill, with Joshua as their caretaker.

The team steps through a painting to rescue Danny and Caulder's daughter, who has enlarged Ezekiel and Admiral Whiskers. The two creatures have forced Mr. Nobody out and are on a rampage.

Although Bowlby, Bomer, and Fraser reprise their roles from the DC Universe series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'', the two shows are set in separate continuities.\n\nFilming began in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in late August 2018, and the first season premiered on February 15, 2019. In July 2019, the series was renewed for a second season, which is set to premiere in 2020 on both DC Universe and [[HBO Max]].{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doom Patrol'' follows the unlikely heroes of [[Doom Patrol|the eponymous team]] who all received their powers through tragic circumstances and are generally shunned by society. Most members of the team were treated by [[Chief (comics)|the Chief]], a medical doctor who gave them residence in his mansion to help protect them from the outside world. Their name derives from an earlier Doom Patrol team that was formed by the Chief.\n\nThe first members of the Doom Patrol to be introduced in the series are [[Crazy Jane|Jane]], the dominant personality of a traumatized woman with [[dissociative identity disorder]]; [[Elasti-Girl|Rita Farr]], who struggles to prevent her body from turning to a gelatinous state; [[Negative Man|Larry Trainor]], who has an entity of negative energy living inside of him; and [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Cliff Steele]], whose brain was placed in a robot body following a car accident. The team is later joined by cybernetically-enhanced superhero [[Cyborg (comics)|Vic Stone]].\n\nIn the first season, the Chief is captured by the malevolent [[Mr. Nobody (comics)|Mr. Nobody]], sending the Doom Patrol on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, they discover secrets about themselves and of the Chief, whom they eventually learn is responsible for the tragic events that gave them their powers.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Diane Guerrero]] as [[Crazy Jane|Jane]]: The dominant personality of Kay Challis, a young woman who developed 64 distinct personalities from trauma she experienced as a child and received powers for each personality from an experiment she was involuntarily subjected to.<ref name=\"Guerrero\">{{cite web |last1=Otterson |first1=Joe |title=''Orange Is the New Black'' Star Diane Guerrero Joins ''Doom Patrol'' Series at DC Universe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/doom-patrol-dc-universe-diane-gurrero-1202890215/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 30, 2018 |date=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731003003/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/doom-patrol-dc-universe-diane-gurrero-1202890215/ |archive-date=July 31, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Inside Kay's subconsciousness, Guerrero also plays Driver 8 and Karen, while Anna Lore plays Penny Farthing, Stephanie Czajkowski plays Hammerhead, [[Tara Lee]] plays Lucy Fugue, Chelsea Alana Rivera plays Silver Tongue, Hannah Alline plays Pretty Polly, Jackie Goldston plays the Secretary, [[Monica Louwerens]] plays the Weird Sisters, and Helen Abell plays [[Black Annis]].

Also living with Caulder are Rita Farr, a 1950s actress who was exposed to a toxin while filming that turned her into plastic, and Larry Trainor, a former [[United States Air Force]] test pilot who was exposed to negative energy in the early 1960s. In the present, the group have lived together for many years in \"Doom Manor\" with Jane, a young woman with 64 super-powered personalities. Jane convinces the others to go into the nearby town of Cloverton, [[Ohio]] while Caulder is away. Rita becomes upset and turns elastic, unintentionally wreaking havoc until Cliff stops her. Caulder urges them to flee with him, as their actions will attract the enemies he has been hiding from. He, Jane, Rita, and Larry leave, but they return to help Cliff protect Cloverton.

Victor \"Vic\" Stone, a half-man, half-machine friend of Caulder's as well as [[Detroit]]'s well known superhero Cyborg, sees news footage of Cloverton's destruction, and travels there to investigate. Morden's donkey spits out Jane. Back at Doom Manor, Cliff is unable to interrogate Jane about her experience because she is cycling through her personalities. As Cliff learns about Jane's condition, Vic triggers one of her violent personalities and she attacks him and Cliff. Rita begrudgingly agrees to go into the gateway via the donkey's mouth, and Larry and Vic are sucked in as well. On the other side, Morden tortures them with fantasies to thwart their search for Caulder, but Larry's energy being intervenes and the team, as well as the entire town of Cloverton, are spit back out.

They were then given the choice of exchanging their coin with one minted in the other city, assuming insignificant time and effort involved in this process. It was found that 85% of participants chose to retain their original coin which can be explained by the inertia account of remaining at the status quo.

Whereas, individuals who were not given a mug were only willing to spend, on average, around three dollars on the same mug. This therefore demonstrated that losses exert a greater impact than gains.

One possible driver that many underlie avolition is psychological inertia. It has been argued that as individuals with schizophrenia may be less able to convert their preferences into actions, they may display an increased tendency to maintain a current state, even if they attribute greater value to a different option available. Therefore, this causes these individuals to display greater levels of psychological inertia, and since this process inhibits their action, its presence could drive avolition. James Gold found that motivational impairments of schizophrenia may be associated with abnormalities in estimating the \"cost\" of effortful behaviour leading to increased psychological inertia which, in turn, could lead to increased avolition in these individuals. However, research into links between psychological inertia and schizophrenia is limited as is their relationship to avolition. For example, research is needed to explore whether the differences in levels of psychological inertia in individuals with schizophrenia only occur when there is a need to engage high levels of inertia or when the individual displays a high level of avolition. Research has shown, however, that the differences in levels of psychological inertia among individuals with schizophrenia is not only due to avolition but could be caused by attention deficits or action-readiness deficits.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suri |first1=Gaurav |last2=Lavaysse |first2=Lindsey |last3=Young |first3=Gerald |last4=Moodie |first4=Craig |last5=Tersakyan |first5=Alen |last6=Gross |first6=James |last7=Gard |first7=David |title=An investigation into the drivers of avolition in schizophrenia |journal=Psychiatry Research |date=January 2018 |volume=261 |pages=225\u2013231 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2018.01.001|pmid=29329039 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nPsychological inertia is believed to be one explanation factor in crime continuity, that is the persistence of criminal behaviour. Glenn Walter's psychological inertia theorem states that crime continuity is partly caused by cognitive factors that account for the continuity in behaviour between past and future criminality and derives from his broader 'lifestyle theory' model, which explains the overall development of a criminal lifestyle. Walter's theorem is based upon Newton's law of inertia which states that a body will remain in motion until acted upon by an outside force, in which here the body in motion is crime. \nWithin this theorem, Walter attributes six slow-changing variables that when combined link past criminality with future criminality. \nThese six cognitive variables are:\n# Criminal thinking (antisocial attitudes and irrational thought patterns)\n# Positive outcome expectancies for crime (belief that crime will have specific positive outcomes)\n# Attribution biases (tendency to view the world as hostile and others as malicious)\n# Efficacy expectations (lack of confidence in one's ability to avoid criminal opportunities in the future)\n# Goals (i.e. focus on short-term goals which becomes detrimental to long-term goals)\n# Values (pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure and immediate gratification)\nThe psychological inertia theorem argues that criminal involvement gives rise to these six cognitive variables which then encourage further offending behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walters |first1=Glenn |title=Crime Continuity and Psychological Inertia: Testing the Cognitive Mediation and Additive Postulates with Male Adjudicated Delinquents |journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology |date=2016 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=237\u2013252 |doi=10.1007/s10940-015-9262-9}}</ref>\n\nTheories surrounding the expectation of behavioural continuity are a topic of debate in the criminal justice community.

Walter's theorem is based upon Newton's law of inertia which states that a body will remain in motion until acted upon by an outside force, in which here the body in motion is crime. \nWithin this theorem, Walter attributes six slow-changing variables that when combined link past criminality with future criminality. \nThese six cognitive variables are:\n# Criminal thinking (antisocial attitudes and irrational thought patterns)\n# Positive outcome expectancies for crime (belief that crime will have specific positive outcomes)\n# Attribution biases (tendency to view the world as hostile and others as malicious)\n# Efficacy expectations (lack of confidence in one's ability to avoid criminal opportunities in the future)\n# Goals (i.e. focus on short-term goals which becomes detrimental to long-term goals)\n# Values (pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure and immediate gratification)\nThe psychological inertia theorem argues that criminal involvement gives rise to these six cognitive variables which then encourage further offending behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walters |first1=Glenn |title=Crime Continuity and Psychological Inertia: Testing the Cognitive Mediation and Additive Postulates with Male Adjudicated Delinquents |journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology |date=2016 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=237\u2013252 |doi=10.1007/s10940-015-9262-9}}</ref>\n\nTheories surrounding the expectation of behavioural continuity are a topic of debate in the criminal justice community. But the conventional wisdom that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour has generally led to \"an expectation that offenders with histories of criminal violence in the community are at increased risk for disruptive conduct in prison [and] has been operationalized as a routine component in prison risk classifications\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0093934 |pmid = 22849420|title = Community violence to prison assault: A test of the behavioral continuity hypothesis|journal = Law and Human Behavior|volume = 36|issue = 4|pages = 356\u2013363|year = 2012|last1 = Reidy|first1 = Thomas J.|last2 = Sorensen|first2 = Jon R.|last3 = Cunningham|first3 = Mark D.}}</ref> \n\n=== Workplace ===\nPsychological inertia has been found to be prevalent in change management within the workplace due to the fact it causes individuals to feel anxiety and fear as a result of any type of change away from the status-quo which may bring new responsibilities and roles. There are a variety of different interventions that have been suggested to overcome this psychological inertia which include providing fuller information including explaining the benefits that such a change will bring, causing people to feel less anxious and more motivated to carry out this change.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=Hugh |title=Context, communication and commiseration: Psychological and practical considerations in change management|journal=Perspectives: Policy and Practice in Higher Education |date=2013 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=30\u201336 |doi=10.1080/13603108.2012.713873|doi-broken-date=2020-04-12 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13603108.2012.713873|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Social inertia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cognitive biases]]\n[[Category:Behavioral economics]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 -WP:WCWproject (Unbalanced quotes in ref name or illegal character.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_inertia"}

In the Congo the ecoregion is almost conterminous with [[Katanga Province]]. In Zambia it covers the northern half of the country above [[Lusaka]], including the eastern and western \"ears\" and the [[Copperbelt]]. In Tanzania it covers the western inland provinces between [[Lake Victoria]], [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Malawi]].\n\nThe area is mostly flat plateau, and the soils are poor. There is a [[tropical climate]] with a long dry season, up to seven months, which leaves the forest vulnerable to fires, and a rainy season from November to March. The woodland is interspersed with riverside [[dambo]]s (grassy wetlands), which may constitute up to thirty percent of the region.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands|id=at0704}}</ref>\n\n==Flora==\nThe woodlands contain much typical [[miombo]] flora of high trees with shrub and grassland underneath, but has much other plant life too. There are typically more [[evergreen]] trees than in most miombo woodlands. The classic miombo trees ''[[Brachystegia]]'', ''[[Julbernardia]]'', and ''[[Isoberlinia]]'' dominate the woodlands with other tree species such as ''[[Pterocarpus angolensis|Pterocapus angolensis]]'', Albizia sp. and ''[[Afzelia quanzensis]]''. Under the trees lie important areas of plants such as the herbaceous ''[[Crotalaria]]'' and ''[[Indigofera]]''.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe fauna is diverse. The grasses, shrubs and trees sustain many large mammals including [[black rhino]], [[Cape buffalo]], [[African elephant]]s, and [[antelope]]s such as [[Taurotragus|elands]], [[sable antelope]], [[roan antelope]],  [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest]], and [[sitatunga]]. Large carnivores include [[lion]] (''Panthera leo''), [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[spotted hyena]] (''Crocuta crocuta''), [[striped hyena]] (''Hyaena hyaena''), [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') and [[side-striped jackal]] (''Canis adustus''). There are also many [[primate]]s in the woodlands, particularly in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including [[yellow baboon]] and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]. The [[Gombe Stream National Park]] chimpanzee reserve is in this ecoregion. The only [[endemic]] mammals are [[Monard's dormouse]] (''Graphiurus monardi''), [[Rosevear's lemniscomys]] (''Lemniscomys roseveari''), [[Ansell's shrew]] (''Crocidura ansellorum'') and [[Upemba shrew]] (''Crocidura zimmeri'').\n\nThe woodlands are also home to many reptiles and birds. There are two endemic bird species, both found in the area of the ecoregion within the Democratic Republic of the Congo: the [[Lake Lufira weaver]] (''Ploceus ruweti'') and the [[black-lored waxbill]] (''Estrilda nigriloris'').\n\nThere are nineteen endemic reptiles and thirteen endemic amphibians; a particularly rich area for these is [[Upemba National Park]].\n\n==Urban areas and settlements==\nAlthough the ecoregion does include large areas of wilderness and national parkland, there are also areas with quite heavy population densities, particularly in Malawi and Burundi and in densely populated urban areas such as [[Lusaka]] in Zambia, around which the forest has been largely cleared for planting, firewood and charcoal production. Most of Zambia north of Lusaka is in this ecoregion, including the [[Copperbelt]] cities of [[Ndola]], [[Kitwe]], [[Chingola]], location of the huge Nchanga Mines, [[Luanshya]], and the [[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]] former mining town of [[Kabwe]] (Broken Hill). In Congo, Katanga has a copper and [[cobalt]] mining industry, and there is a railway line north through the province from the capital [[Lubumbashi]]. In Tanzania the [[Lake Tanganyika]] port of [[Kigoma]] is the starting point for a visit to [[Gombe Stream National Park]].\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThreats to the area include [[bushmeat]] hunting, in particular the [[poaching]] of elephant and rhino. Fire is damaging throughout the region and where there are human populations fire is more common, including the burning of woodland to create agricultural land or for charcoal, for example in Central Zambia. In the highly urbanised Copperbelt areas of Zambia and the Congo the forest has been extensively cleared for charcoal and farming, and waterways polluted by the mining industry, while the civil war in the Congo has led to considerable damage to the environment there.\n\nThe ecoregion includes large areas of national park, game reserves and other protected areas, including:\n* in Democratic Republic of the Congo - [[Upemba National Park]].\n* in Malawi  - [[Nyika National Park]], [[Kasungu National Park]], [[Vwaza Marsh Wildlife Reserve]], and [[Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve]].\n* in Tanzania- [[Katavi National Park]] and [[Gombe Stream National Park]]\n* in Zambia -  the large [[Kafue National Park]] in western Zambia, [[Isangano National Park]], [[Lavushi Manda National Park]], and privately-managed [[Kasanka National Park]] in central Zambia, the [[Chembe Bird Sanctuary]] in the Copperbelt, and [[Mweru Wantipa National Park]], [[Lusenga Plain National Park]], and [[Nsumbu National Park]] in northern Zambia.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ecoregions of Zambia]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061007180042/http://worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/photos/at/at0704a.html Wildworld photo]\n*[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00224639 Development of a MIOMBO woodland dynamics model in Zambezian Africa Using Malawi as a case study]\n*[http://www.metla.fi/julkaisut/workingpapers/2008/mwp098-14.pdf Opportunities and challenges for sustainable management of miombo woodlands: the Zambian perspective]\n\n{{coord missing|Zambia}}\n\n[[Category:Miombo|.]]\n[[Category:Afrotropic ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Central Zambezian miombo woodlands]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Africa]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Angola]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Burundi]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Malawi]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Tanzania]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Flora of South Tropical Africa|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of West-Central Tropical Africa|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of Angola|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of Burundi|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of Malawi|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of Tanzania|*]]\n[[Category:Flora of Zambia|*]]\n[[Category:Forests of Angola]]\n[[Category:Forests of Burundi]]\n[[Category:Forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:Forests of Malawi]]\n[[Category:Forests of Tanzania]]\n[[Category:Forests of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Grasslands of Africa]]\n[[Category:Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]]\n[[Category:Zambezian region]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox ecoregion\n|name = Central Zambezian miombo woodlands\n|image = Flickr - ggallice - Miombo woodland (1).jpg\n|image_size = 300\n|image_alt = center\n|caption = Miombo woodland in [[Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve]], [[Malawi]]\n|map = Ecoregion AT0704.svg\n|map_size = 300 px\n|map_alt = center\n|map_caption = Distribution of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands\n|biogeographic_realm = [[Afrotropical realme|Afrotropical]]\n|biome = [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]]\n|animals =\n|bird_species =\n|mammal_species =\n|border =\n|borders =\n|area = 1,184,200|km2|sqmi\n|country =\n|countries = [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]]\n|state =\n|region_type =\n|elevation =\n|coordinates = \n|geology =\n|seas =\n|rivers =\n|climate =\n|soil =\n|conservation = vulnerable\n|global200 = yes\n|habitat_loss =\n|habitat_loss_ref =\n|protected =\n|protected_ref =\n|embedded = \n}}\n\nThe densely forested '''Central Zambezian miombo woodlands''' that cut across southern central [[Africa]] are one of the largest ecozones on the continent and home to a great variety of wildlife, including many large mammals.\n\n==Location and description==\nThe region covers a large area stretching northeast from [[Angola]], including the southeast section of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the northern half of [[Zambia]], a large section of western [[Tanzania]], southern [[Burundi]], and northern and western [[Malawi]].
