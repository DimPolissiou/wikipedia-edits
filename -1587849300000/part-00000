Compared to other social movements, the Chinese government has historically been more tolerant of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs and civil society organizations, relying on them to reach out to marginalized groups most vulnerable to the disease. \n\nThe government at all administrative levels has also often sought to suppress or minimize activism perceived as sensitive, obscene, or a threat to stability, including that related to HIV/AIDS.{{sfn|HRW|2005}} This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in Henan, where the initial blood donation outbreak, in which local authorities were extensively involved, was most severe.{{sfn|HRW|2005|pp=13-14}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Agence France-Presse |title=China Aids activists sceptical of Li Keqiang\u2019s outreach |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1093788/china-aids-activists-sceptical-li-keqiangs-outreach |work=South China Morning Post |date=29 November 2012 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, activist [[Gao Yaojie]] was placed under house arrest in her home in [[Zhengzhou]] in order to prevent her from visiting the United States to receive an award from [[Vital Voices Global Partnership]] and meet with [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name=\"NYT2007\">{{cite news |last1=Yardley |first1=Jim |title=China Places AIDS Activist Under House Arrest |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/world/asia/06china.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |agency=The New York Times |date=6 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Socioeconomic effect==\nThe process of the effect of HIV/AIDS can be described as having three key stages: first, the effect experienced at the micro level; second, at the sectoral level; and finally, at the macro level. The effect began to be observed in China at the micro, or [[household]] level, and will most certainly be observed in the future at the sectoral level. Individuals and families have been bearing both the economic and social costs of the disease, and the poverty of those affected have increased and will further increase substantially. Expenditures for the health sector will increase, for both treatment and prevention interventions. The macro level has been mostly unaffected . But if without effective preventive action, the HIV spread in the general population at large will affect the macro level as have happened in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>\"The Socioeconomic Impact of HIV/AIDS\" Research Team.

Individuals and families have been bearing both the economic and social costs of the disease, and the poverty of those affected have increased and will further increase substantially.
