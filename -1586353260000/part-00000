The great successes of his expedition, however, were rendered null when [[Shah Tahmasp II]] decided to take personal command of the theatre in Nader's absence, forcing a furious Nader to return and rectify the situation after forcing Tahmasp's abdication in favour of his infant son Abbas III.\n\n== The Ottoman occupation ==\nThe Ottomans had entered the western regions of the country in the early 1720s when the [[Hotak|Hotaki]] invasion of Mahmud I was launched against the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] state. In a decisive engagement near Gulnabad, Mahmud Hotaki managed a surprising victory against a far greater (though severely divided) Persian army. The route of the imperial army allowed him to march on the capital Isfahan which he captured after a 6-month siege that caused unheard misery and loss of life in the city. During the chaos of the Safavid overthrow, the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire seized on this opportunity to annex as much land as they could with Ottoman Turkey taking western Persia and dividing the Caucasus up with the Russians.\n\nSoon the Hotaki conquerors installed a new leader as king through a coup de'tat in which Mahmud I was replaced with a capable cousin of his; Ashraf. Ashraf marched west to put a halt to any further expansion by the Ottomans and to the surprise of many defeated them. The diplomatic outcome however was very much reconciliatory as the Ottomans promised recognition of Ashraf as the legitimate Shah of Persia in exchange for Ashraf's acknowledgement of Ottoman rule in their new territories in the [[Caucasus]] and western Persia.\n\nAs Nader and Ashraf came head-to-head in a conflict that would decide the fate of the country, the Ottomans wisely supported Ashraf against the Safavid loyalists as a resurgent Persia under an ambitious and talented general who would be flushed with the success of conquest would not bode well for the Ottomans hold on their newly acquired provinces. Despite support from the Turks, Nader still managed to completely destroy Ashraf's forces in numerous engagements which led to re-establishing the Safavid state under the nominal rule of Tahmasp II. Istanbul's fears had been realised as Nader would certainly turn to liberating the lost territories of the empire. The Ottomans however had been present in the west of the country for close to a decade and would prove a very formidable challenge to any efforts at their expulsion from what now formed the eastern boundaries of ''their'' empire.\n\n== Nader marches on Nahavand ==\nOn March 9, 1730, the Persian army exited Shiraz and in a leisurely manner celebrated the new year ([[Nowruz]]), after which Nader commenced a rapid forced march westward in the hope of catching the Ottomans off balance. Reaching Ottoman-occupied town of Nahavand via Luristan, Nader put the Turks here to flight towards Hamadan, where, recovering from their initial shock and panic, they regrouped and presented themselves in the valley of [[Malayer]] to give battle in the hope of ending the Persian advance on [[Hamadan]].\n\n== The Battle of Malayer Valley ==\n[[File:Valley battle 001111.jpg|360px|thumb|a military diagram of the battle of Malayer valley]]\nThe Ottoman force of ~30.000 men arrayed in front of the 25.000 men strong Persian army, which  was of a different nature altogether from all the previous foes the Persian army had faced up to this point. The Afghan and tribal opponents of Nader had been almost completely devoid of any infantry or artillery units (excluding [[Battle of Murche-Khort|Murche-Khort]]), comprised almost exclusively of excellent mounted warriors instead.\n\nNow Nader faced an adversary who in many respects mirrored the Persian army's own composition in structure as well as constituent unit types. The Turks had drawn themselves up parallel to a stream flowing through the valley, on the other side of which Nader deployed his men into three separate divisions, placing himself in the centre. As the two armies came within musket range of each other, a general fire broke out along the entire length of the line, with the smoke created from the muskets & cannon dancing over the shallow body of water separating the two armies, obscuring the Persians and Ottomans from each other's view. Nader, under this veil of smoke, started strengthening and preparing his right wing for a bold gamble.\n\n[[File:Hamadan 2 by Eug\u00e8ne Flandin.jpg|thumb|left|360px|The battle of Malayer Valley opened the road to [[Hamadan]]]]\nNader gave the order for a sudden thrust by his right flank across the stream. The Persians appeared from the billowing cloud of smoke that had concealed their advance and threw the Ottomans, who were dazzled by the unexpected appearance of the enemy seemingly out of thin air, into disarray. An intense few hours of fighting followed, with the Ottomans attempting to salvage their left to no avail. The onslaught of the Persian right cut further into the flesh of the Turk's left wing and the killing of the chief Ottoman Bannerman caused a much demoralised army to turn tail and flee, with Persian cavalry in pursuit cutting down and imprisoning a large number of men. A clear victory was won, opening the road to Hamadan for Nader's troops.\n\n== Nader pivots north ==\nAfter liberating [[Hamadan]] along with its 10,000 imprisoned Persian soldiers, Nader gained Kermanshah, thus liberating large swathes of western Persia from Ottoman rule.

The great successes of his expedition, however, were rendered null when [[Shah Tahmasp II]] decided to take personal command of the theatre in Nader's absence, forcing a furious Nader to return and rectify the situation after forcing Tahmasp's abdication in favour of his infant son Abbas III.\n\n== The Ottoman occupation ==\nThe Ottomans had entered the western regions of the country in the early 1720s when the [[Hotak|Hotaki]] invasion of Mahmud I was launched against the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] state. In a decisive engagement near Gulnabad, Mahmud Hotaki managed a surprising victory against a far greater (though severely divided) Persian army. The route of the imperial army allowed him to march on the capital Isfahan which he captured after a 6-month siege that caused unheard misery and loss of life in the city. During the chaos of the Safavid overthrow, the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire seized on this opportunity to annex as much land as they could with Ottoman Turkey taking western Persia and dividing the Caucasus up with the Russians.\n\nSoon the Hotaki conquerors installed a new leader as king through a coup de'tat in which Mahmud I was replaced with a capable cousin of his; Ashraf. Ashraf marched west to put a halt to any further expansion by the Ottomans and to the surprise of many defeated them. The diplomatic outcome however was very much reconciliatory as the Ottomans promised recognition of Ashraf as the legitimate Shah of Persia in exchange for Ashraf's acknowledgement of Ottoman rule in their new territories in the [[Caucasus]] and western Persia.\n\nAs Nader and Ashraf came head-to-head in a conflict that would decide the fate of the country, the Ottomans wisely supported Ashraf against the Safavid loyalists as a resurgent Persia under an ambitious and talented general who would be flushed with the success of conquest would not bode well for the Ottomans hold on their newly acquired provinces. Despite support from the Turks, Nader still managed to completely destroy Ashraf's forces in numerous engagements which led to re-establishing the Safavid state under the nominal rule of Tahmasp II. Istanbul's fears had been realised as Nader would certainly turn to liberating the lost territories of the empire. The Ottomans however had been present in the west of the country for close to a decade and would prove a very formidable challenge to any efforts at their expulsion from what now formed the eastern boundaries of ''their'' empire.\n\n== Nader marches on Nahavand ==\nOn March 9, 1730, the Persian army exited Shiraz and in a leisurely manner celebrated the new year ([[Nowruz]]), after which Nader commenced a rapid forced march westward in the hope of catching the Ottomans off balance. Reaching Ottoman-occupied town of Nahavand via Luristan, Nader put the Turks here to flight towards Hamadan, where, recovering from their initial shock and panic, they regrouped and presented themselves in the valley of [[Malayer]] to give battle in the hope of ending the Persian advance on [[Hamadan]].\n\n== The Battle of Malayer Valley ==\n[[File:Valley battle 001111.jpg|360px|thumb|a military diagram of the battle of Malayer valley]]\nThe Ottoman force of ~30.000 men arrayed in front of the 25.000 men strong Persian army, was of a different nature altogether from all the previous foes the Persian army had faced up to this point. The Afghan and tribal opponents of Nader had been almost completely devoid of any infantry or artillery units (excluding [[Battle of Murche-Khort|Murche-Khort]]), comprised almost exclusively of excellent mounted warriors instead.\n\nNow Nader faced an adversary who in many respects mirrored the Persian army's own composition in structure as well as constituent unit types. The Turks had drawn themselves up parallel to a stream flowing through the valley, on the other side of which Nader deployed his men into three separate divisions, placing himself in the centre. As the two armies came within musket range of each other, a general fire broke out along the entire length of the line, with the smoke created from the muskets & cannon dancing over the shallow body of water separating the two armies, obscuring the Persians and Ottomans from each other's view. Nader, under this veil of smoke, started strengthening and preparing his right wing for a bold gamble.\n\n[[File:Hamadan 2 by Eug\u00e8ne Flandin.jpg|thumb|left|360px|The battle of Malayer Valley opened the road to [[Hamadan]]]]\nNader gave the order for a sudden thrust by his right flank across the stream. The Persians appeared from the billowing cloud of smoke that had concealed their advance and threw the Ottomans, who were dazzled by the unexpected appearance of the enemy seemingly out of thin air, into disarray. An intense few hours of fighting followed, with the Ottomans attempting to salvage their left to no avail. The onslaught of the Persian right cut further into the flesh of the Turk's left wing and the killing of the chief Ottoman Bannerman caused a much demoralised army to turn tail and flee, with Persian cavalry in pursuit cutting down and imprisoning a large number of men. A clear victory was won, opening the road to Hamadan for Nader's troops.\n\n== Nader pivots north ==\nAfter liberating [[Hamadan]] along with its 10,000 imprisoned Persian soldiers, Nader gained Kermanshah, thus liberating large swathes of western Persia from Ottoman rule. Leaving behind a fortified position, he now moved his army to Azerbaijan, where he took [[Tabriz]] on August 12, crushing an army sent (too late) to reinforce Tabriz. The Turkish prisoners were treated kindly, with Nader freeing many of the Pashas, dispatching them with messages of peace to Constantinople (Istanbul). In a lightning campaign Nader had reincorporated all the main provinces of the Persian heartland.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military of the Afsharid dynasty of Persia]]\n*[[Ottoman\u2013Persian War (1730\u201335)]]\n*[[Tahmasp's Ottoman Campaign]]\n*[[Military history of Iran]]\n*[[Ottoman\u2013Persian Wars]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Ottoman\u2013Persian Wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1735]]\n[[Category:1735 in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:1730 in Iran]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Safavid dynasty]]\n", "name_user": "Persian Empire 1509", "label": "safe", "comment": "A grammatical mistake was corrected", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Persia_campaign_of_1730"}

Its first editors were D. Meldola and M. Angel. It was issued as a weekly until May 1842, when it was suspended. From October 1844, it resumed as a fortnightly, with Joseph Mitchell as its editor. In 1847, it became again a weekly newspaper. A. Benisch, who became the proprietor and editor in 1855, bequeathed the paper to the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] in 1878, who sold it to its new editor and anti-Zionist Asher I. Myers, Sydney M.

Under the leadership of [[Francis Goldsmid|Francis Henry Goldsmid]], the pogroms were not mentioned by the newspaper and it was only after the feminist [[Louisa Goldsmid]] gave her support following calls to arms by an anonymous writer named \"Juriscontalus\" and Asher Myers of ''The Jewish Chronicle'' that action was taken.

Greenberg himself became its editor.<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nAt the time, ''The JC'' gained a near monopoly in the Jewish press, taking over its principal competitors, ''The Hebrew Observer'' and ''The Jewish World''. Only in October 1919, did ''The JC'' get a strong opposing voice from ''The Jewish Guardian'', paper of the [[League of British Jews]], which counterbalanced the Zionist views of ''The JC'', until it disappeared in 1931. After Greenberg's death, the same year, ''The JC'' remained moderately pro-Zionist under the leadership of [[Leopold Kessler (Zionist)|Leopold Kessler]].<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nThe weekly newspaper ''The Jewish World'' was taken over in 1913.

After service as a soldier in [[World War II]] during which his father had died, Kessler found that the editor, [[Ivan Greenberg]], had taken a right-wing Zionist position highly critical of moderate Zionists and the British policy in Palestine. Kessler, after a struggle with the newspaper's board, sacked Greenberg and installed a moderate editor.<ref name=guardian-19991201>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/01/guardianobituaries |title=David Kessler |last=Paul |first=Geoffrey |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 December 1999 |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Kessler family owned 80% of the newspaper's shares.

After the Declaration was issued, however, the paper became critical of [[Chaim Weizmann]].

Its first editors were D. Meldola and M. Angel. It was issued as a weekly until May 1842, when it was suspended. From October 1844, it resumed as a fortnightly, with Joseph Mitchell as its editor. In 1847, it became again a weekly newspaper. A. Benisch, who became the proprietor and editor in 1855, bequeathed the paper to the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] in 1878, who sold it to its new editor and anti-Zionist Asher I. Myers, Sydney M.

Under the leadership of [[Francis Goldsmid|Francis Henry Goldsmid]], the pogroms were not mentioned by the newspaper and it was only after the feminist [[Louisa Goldsmid]] gave her support following calls to arms by an anonymous writer named \"Juriscontalus\" and Asher Myers of ''The Jewish Chronicle'' that action was taken.

Greenberg himself became its editor.<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nAt the time, ''The JC'' gained a near monopoly in the Jewish press, taking over its principal competitors, ''The Hebrew Observer'' and ''The Jewish World''. Only in October 1919, did ''The JC'' get a strong opposing voice from ''The Jewish Guardian'', paper of the [[League of British Jews]], which counterbalanced the Zionist views of ''The JC'', until it disappeared in 1931. After Greenberg's death, the same year, ''The JC'' remained moderately pro-Zionist under the leadership of [[Leopold Kessler (Zionist)|Leopold Kessler]].<ref name=\"encycl\" />\n\nThe weekly newspaper ''The Jewish World'' was taken over in 1913.

Kessler]] became managing director to assist his chairman father [[Leopold Kessler (Zionist)|Leopold Kessler]], a moderate Zionist and an associate of [[Theodor Herzl]], known as the father of the [[State of Israel]]. After service as a soldier in [[World War II]] during which his father had died, Kessler found that the editor, [[Ivan Greenberg]], had taken a right-wing Zionist position highly critical of moderate Zionists and the British policy in Palestine. Kessler, after a struggle with the newspaper's board, sacked Greenberg and installed a moderate editor.<ref name=guardian-19991201>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/01/guardianobituaries |title=David Kessler |last=Paul |first=Geoffrey |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 December 1999 |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Kessler family owned 80% of the newspaper's shares.

After the Declaration was issued, however, the paper became critical of [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Greenberg was discontented with the too vague definition of the Zionist goals and wanted him to state clearly that Palestine must be politically Jewish.

The latter were named ''Dorian'' by the ancient Greek writers, after the [[Dorians]], the historical population that spoke them.\n\nGreek legend asserts that the Dorians took possession of the [[Peloponnesus]] in an event called the '''Return of the Heracleidae'''  ({{lang-grc|\u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u1f74 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f29\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd}}). Nineteenth-century Classical scholars saw in the legend a possibly real event they termed the ''Dorian invasion''. The meaning of the concept has changed several times, as historians, [[philologist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s used it in attempts to explain the cultural discontinuities expressed in the data of their fields. The pattern of arrival of Dorian culture on certain islands in the [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Crete]], is also not well understood. The Dorians colonised a number of sites on Crete such as [[Lato]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10847/lato.html#fieldnotes |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |title=Lato Hillfort |work=The Modern Antiquarian |date=10 January 2008 |publisher=Julian Cope}}</ref>\n\nDespite nearly 200 years of investigation, the historicity of a mass migration of Dorians into Greece has never been established, and the origin of the Dorians remains unknown.  Some have linked them or their victims with the emergence of the equally mysterious [[Sea Peoples]].  The meaning of the phrase \"Dorian invasion\" as an explanation for the cultural and economic breakdown after the [[Mycenaean period]] has become to some degree amorphous.  Investigations into it have served mainly to rule out various speculations, though the possibility of a real Dorian invasion remains open.\n\n==Return of the Heracleidae==\n[[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2648.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Heracles and Athena. an [[Attic Greek|Attic]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure vase]].]]\nClassical tradition, as recorded for example in Herodotus, describes the \"Return of the [[Heracleidae]]\" (\u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u1f74 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f29\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd), the descendants of [[Heracles]], who were exiled at his death and returned in later generations to reclaim the dominion that Heracles had held in the [[Peloponnesus]]. The Greece to which the tradition refers is the mythic one, now considered to be [[Mycenaean Greece]]. The details differ from one ancient author to another, the commonality being that a traditional ruling clan traced its legitimacy to Heracles.\n\nThe Greek words referring to the influx of the Dorians are ''katienai''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*k%3Aentry+group%3D84 |encyclopedia=Greek-English Lexicon |first=Henry George |last=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |year=2007 |origyear=1940 |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |location=Medford}}</ref> and ''katerchesthai'', literally \"to descend\",  \"come down\" or \"go down\" or, less commonly, \"be brought down.\" It means a descent from uplands to lowlands, or from earth to grave, or rushing down as a flood, or sweeping down as a wind, or those who have returned from exile by ship.  This sweeping down upon the Peloponnesus invited the English translation \"invasion\".\n\nThere is, however, a distinction between Heracleidae and Dorians. [[George Grote]] summarizes the relationship as follows:<ref name=GroteXVIII>George Grote, ''Greece'' Part I, Chapter XVIII, Section I: \"Return of the Herakleids into [[Peloponnesus]].\"</ref><blockquote>\"[[Herakles]] himself had rendered inestimable aid to the Dorian king [[Aegimius]], when the latter was hard pressed in a contest with the [[Lapithae]] .... Herakles defeated the Lapithae and slew their king [[Coronus (Greek mythology)|Koronus]]; in return for which Aegimius assigned to his deliverers one third part of his whole territory and adopted [[Hyllus]] as his son.\"</blockquote>Hyllus, a [[Perseus|Perseid]], was driven from the state of [[Mycenae]] into exile after the death of Heracles by a dynastic rival, [[Eurystheus]], another {{nowrap|Perseid:<ref name=GroteIV>George Grote, ''Greece'' Chapter IV: \"Heroic Legends : Exile of the Herakleids.\"</ref>}}\n<blockquote>\"After the death ... of Herakles, his son Hyllos and his other children were expelled and persecuted by Eurystheus ... Eurystheus invaded [[Attica]], but perished in the attempt .... All the sons of Eurystheus lost their lives ... with him, so that the Perseid family was now represented only by the Herakleids ....\"</blockquote>The [[Pelops|Pelopid]] family now assumed power. The Heraclids \"endeavored to recover the possessions from which they had been expelled\" but were defeated by the Ionians at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. Hyllus staked peace for three generations against immediate reoccupation on a single combat and was killed by [[Echemus]] of [[Arcadia]].\n\nThe Heracleidae now found it prudent to claim the Dorian land granted to Heracles:<ref name=GroteXVIII/> \"and from this moment the Herakleids and Dorians became intimately united together into one social communion.\" Three generations later the Heracleidae with Dorian collusion occupied the Peloponnesus, an event Grote terms a \"victorious invasion.\"<ref name=GroteIV/>\n\n==The term \"invasion\"==\n[[File:Rider BM B1.jpg|thumb|300px|A 6th-century BC cup from [[Laconia]], the very center of the classical Dorians, representing [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory, attending upon a Spartan warrior.]]\nThe first widespread use of the term \"Dorian invasion\" appears to date to the 1830s. A popular alternative was the \"Dorian migration\". For example, in 1831 Thomas Keightly was using \"Dorian migration\" in ''Outline of History''; by 1838 in ''The Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy'' he was using \"Dorian invasion\".\n\nNeither of those two words exactly fits the events, as they imply an incursion from outside a society to within; but the Dorians were not outside of either Greece or Greek society. [[William Mitford]]'s ''History of Greece'' (1784\u20131810)<ref>Mitford's single-volume first edition came out in 1784 to be followed by a second edition containing Volumes I and II in 1789. The remainder of the initial 8-volume set was published by 1810. The third edition of 1821 had more volumes. Some 29 editions more followed. Mitford's work features marginal notes stating the ancient sources.</ref> described a \"Dorian conquest\" followed by \"a revolution in Peloponnesus so complete that, except in the rugged province of Arcadia, nothing remained unaltered.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Mitford |title=The History of Greece |page=197 |volume=Volume I |location=Boston |publisher=Timothy Bedlington and Charles Ewer, Cornhill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vsAPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=Mitford+History+of+Greece#v=onepage&q=dorian%20revolution&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824 [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]'s ''Die Dorier'' was published in German and was translated into English by Tufnel and Lewis for publication in 1830. They use such terms as \"the Doric invasion\"<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|p=107}}.</ref> and \"the invasian of the Dorians\"<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|p=97}}.</ref> to translate M\u00fcller's \"Die Einwanderung von den Doriern\" (literally: \"the migration of the Dorians\"),<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1844|p=85}}.</ref> which was quite a different concept.\n\nOn one level the ''Einwanderung'' meant no more than the ''Heraklidenzug'', the return of the Heracleidae. However, M\u00fcller was also applying the sense of V\u00f6lkerwanderung to it, which was being used of the Germanic migrations. M\u00fcller's approach was [[philology|philological]]. In trying to explain the distribution of tribes and dialects he hypothesized that the aboriginal or [[Pelasgian]] population was Hellenic. His first paragraph of the ''Introduction'' asserts:<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=\"The Dorians derived their origin [''der Ursprung des dorischen Stammes''] from those districts in which the Grecian nation bordered toward the north upon numerous and dissimilar races of barbarians. As to the tribes which dwelt beyond these borders we are indeed wholly destitute of information; nor is there the slightest trace of any memorial or tradition that the Greeks originally came from those quarters.\"}}\n\nM\u00fcller goes on to propose that the original Pelasgian language was the common ancestor of Greek and Latin,<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> that it evolved into Proto-Greek and was corrupted in Macedon and Thessaly by invasions of Illyrians. This same pressure of Illyrians drove forth Greeks speaking Achaean (including Aeolian), Ionian, and finally Dorian in three diachronic waves, explaining the dialect distribution of Greek in classical times.<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|pp=11\u201319}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing this traditional view, Thumb noticed that in the Peloponnesus and in the islands, where the Dorians established themselves, their dialect showed elements  of the [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]] dialect. This can be explained if the Dorians conquered a Pre-Doric population, which was pushed into the Arcadian mountains. Where the Dorians were a minority, there is a mixed dialect, as in [[Boeotia]], or the Dorians adopted the existing dialect, as in [[Thessaly]].<ref>A.Thumb: Handbuch der griechischen Dialekte 1932 : Martin Nilsson ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'' C.F.Beck Verlag, Munchen, p. 330</ref> To the Achaeans described by Homer belongs the Aeolic-Arcadian dialect in the whole of eastern Greece, with the exception of Attica, where the [[Ionians]] were confined.

Paparigopoulos, calling the event the \"Descent of the Heraclidae\", stated that the Heraclidae came from Thessaly after being expelled by the Thessalians living in Epirus.<ref>Paparigopoulos, K., 1902, History of the Greek Nation, (re-edited in demotic Greek, 1995), v. 1, p. 189</ref>\n\n==Kretschmer's external Greeks==\nToward the end of the 19th century the [[philology|philologist]] [[Paul Kretschmer]] made a strong case that [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] was a pre-Greek substrate, perhaps [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]],<ref>{{cite book |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hall |title=Between Ethnicity and Culture |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2002 |page=40 |isbn=0-226-31329-8 |quote=Paul Kretschmer ... had pointed to elements in Greek vocabulary ... that appeared to be non-Hellenic, and therefore pre-Hellenic ... for example, the -nth- suffix in Tirynthos ... which Kretschmer believed had been transmitted to Greece from Anatolia.}}</ref> taking up a classical theme of remnant populations existing in pockets among the Greek speakers, in mountainous and rural [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]] and in inaccessible coasts of the far south. This view left M\u00fcller's proto-Greeks without a homeland, but Kretschmer did not substitute the Heracleidae or their Dorian allies from Macedon and Thessaly. Instead he removed the earliest Greeks to the trail leading from the plains of Asia, where he viewed the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] as having broken up about 2500 BC. Kretschmer suggested that somewhere between that Asian homeland and Greece a new cradle of the Greek tribes developed, from which Proto-Ionians at about 2000 BC, Proto-Achaeans at about 1600 BC and Dorians at about 1200 BC came to swoop down on an increasingly less aboriginal Greece as three waves of external Greeks.<ref>{{harvnb | Drews | 1988 | p=8}}: \"Paul Kretschmer concluded that there had been three Greek invasions of Greece during the Bronze Age. The last of these, ca. 1200 B.C., was surely the Dorian Invasion.\"</ref>\n\nKretschmer was confident that if the unknown homeland of the Greeks was not then known, archaeology would find it. The handbooks of Greek history from then on spoke of Greeks entering Greece. As late as 1956 [[J.B. Bury]]'s ''History of Greece'' (3rd edition) wrote of an \"invasion which brought the Greek language into Greece\". Over that half-century Greek and Balkan archaeology united in an effort to locate the Dorians further north than Greece. The idea was combined with a view that the [[Sea Peoples]] were part of the same north-south migration about 1200 BC.\n\nThe weakness in this theory<ref>A survey of the problems connected with the historicity of the \"Dorian invasion\" may be found {{cite book |first=J.M. |last=Hall |title=A History of the Archaic Greek World ca. 1200\u2013479 BCE |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |year=2007 |pages=Chapter 3 |id=A number of ISBN's, including 0631226672 |nopp=true}}</ref> is that it requires both an invaded Greece and an external area where Greek evolved and continued to evolve into dialects contemporaneously with the invaded Greece. However, although the invaded Greece was amply represented by evidence of all sorts, there was no evidence at all of the external homeland. Similarly, a clear Greek homeland for the Sea Peoples failed to materialize. Retaining M\u00fcller's three waves and Kretschmer's Pelasgian pockets the scholars continued to search for the Dorians in other quarters. M\u00fcller's common ancestor of Greek and Latin had vanished by 1950; and by 1960, although still given lip service, the concept of Greek developing outside of Greece was in decline.<ref>{{harvnb | Drews | 1993 |p=63}}: \"The old view \u2014 that the Dorian invasion proceeded from the central Balkans and that it occurred ca. 1200 \u2014 is now maintained by only a few archaeologists and against increasing evidence to the contrary.\"</ref>\n\n==Greek origin in Greece==\n[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|thumb|550px|The Greek dialects after the event or events termed \"the Dorian invasion.\" Before this, the dialect spoken in the later Dorian range (except for [[Doris (Greece)|Doris]] itself) is believed to have been Achaean, from which Attic, Ionic and Aeolic descended. Doric displaced Achaean in southern Greece.]]\nAdditional progress in the search for the Dorian invasion resulted from the decipherment of [[Linear B]] inscriptions.  The language of the Linear B texts is an early form of Greek now known as [[Mycenaean Greek]]. Comparing it with the later [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]] scholars could trace the development of the dialects from the earlier Mycenaean. For example, classical Greek ''[[anax|anak-s]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bd\u03b1\u03be}}), \"king\", was postulated to be derived from a reconstructed form ''*wanak-'' ({{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03be}}). In the [[Linear B]] texts appears the form {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc37\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc0f}}, ''wa-na-ka'', sometimes accompanied by the {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc37\ud800\udc00\ud800\udc2d}}, ''wa-na-sa'' ({{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}}, \"queen\").\n\nErnst Risch lost no time in proposing that there was never more than one migration, which brought [[proto-Greek]] into Greece. Proto-Greek is the assumed last common ancestor of all known varieties of [[Greek language|Greek]] and then dissimilated into dialects within Greece.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ernst |last=Risch |title=Die Gliederung der griechischen Dialekte in neuer Sicht |journal=Museum Helveticum |volume=12 |year=1955 |pages=61\u201375}} The argument is summarized, and Risch is cited, in {{harvnb | Drews | 1988 | p=39 }}.</ref>  Meanwhile, the linguists closest to the decipherment were having doubts about the classification of proto-Greek. [[John Chadwick]] summarizing in 1976 wrote:<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Chadwick |authorlink=John Chadwick |title=The Mycenaean World |url=https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1976 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/2 2\u20133] |isbn=0-521-21077-1}}</ref><blockquote>\"Let us therefore explore the alternative view.

Georgiev|Georgiev]] suggested that:<ref>{{cite book |last=Georgiev |first=Vladimir Ivanov |title=Introduction to the history of the Indo-European languages |year=1981 |publisher=Pub.

[[JP Mallory]] wrote in 1989 concerning the various hypotheses of proto-Greek that had been put forward since the decipherment:<ref>{{cite book |first=J.P. |last=Mallory |title=In Search of the Indo-Europeans:Language, Archaeology and Myth |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=1991 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/insearchofindoeu00jpma/page/71 71] |isbn=0-500-27616-1 |authorlink=JP Mallory |url=https://archive.org/details/insearchofindoeu00jpma/page/71 }}</ref><blockquote>\"Reconciliation of all these different theories seems out of the question ... the current state of our knowledge of the Greek dialects can accommodate Indo-Europeans entering Greece at any time between 2200 and 1600 BC to emerge later as Greek speakers.\"</blockquote>\n\nBy the end of the 20th century the concept of an invasion by external Greek speakers had ceased to be the mainstream view, (although still asserted by a minority); thus Geoffrey Horrocks writes:<ref>{{Cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Horrocks | editor-first=Ian | editor-last=Morris | editor2-last=Powell | editor2-first=Barry B. |contribution=Homer's Dialect |title=A New Companion to Homer |publisher=Brill |year=1997 |place=Leiden, Boston |pages=193\u2013217 |isbn=90-04-09989-1}}</ref><blockquote>\"Greek is now widely believed to be the product of contact between Indo-European immigrants and the speakers of the indigenous languages of the [[Balkan peninsula]] beginning c. 2,000 B.C.\"</blockquote>\n\nIf the different dialects had developed within Greece no subsequent invasions were required to explain their presence.\n\n==Destruction at the end of Mycenaean IIIB==\n[[File:NAMA Linear B tablet of Pylos.jpg|thumb|300px|A record of Pylos, preserved by baking in the fire that destroyed the palace about 1200 BC, according to the excavator, [[Carl Blegen]].

Indeed, the [[Linear B#Archives|Pylos tablets]] recorded the dispatch of \"coast-watchers\", to be followed not long after by the burning of the palace, presumably by invaders from the sea. [[Carl Blegen]] wrote:<ref name=Blegen>{{Citation |first=Carl |last=Blegen |authorlink=Carl Blegen |contribution=The Mycenaean Age: The Trojan War, the Dorian Invasion and Other Problems |title=Lectures in Memory of Louise Taft Semple: First Series, 1961\u20131965 |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1967 |page=30 |id=LC 67-14407}}.</ref><blockquote>\"the telltale track of the Dorians must be recognized in the fire-scarred ruins of all the great palaces and the more important towns which ... were blotted out at the end of Mycenaean IIIB.\"</blockquote>\nBlegen follows Furumark<ref>{{cite book |first=Arne |last=Furumark |title=Mycenaean Pottery |publisher=Svenska institutet i Athen |year=1972 |isbn=91-85086-03-7}} This book, a pottery lookup reference, arranges pottery by stylistic groups, assigning relative dates correlated when possible to calendar dates, along with the evidence.

Blegen himself dated the Dorian invasion to 1200 BC.\n\nA destruction by Dorians has its own problems (as discussed in the next section) and is not the only possible explanation. At approximately this time [[Hittites|Hittite]] power in Anatolia collapsed with the destruction of their capital [[Hattusa]], and the late [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties of Egypt suffered invasions of the [[Sea Peoples]]. A theory, reported for instance by Thomas and Conant, attributes the ruin of the Peloponnesus to the Sea Peoples:<ref>{{cite book |first=Carol G. |last=Thomas |author2=Craig Conant |title=The Trojan War |publisher=The Greenwood press |location=Westport, Connecticut |page=18 |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32526-X}}</ref><blockquote>\"Evidence on the Linear B tablets from the Mycenaean kingdom of [[Pylos]] describing the dispatch of rowers and watchers to the coast, for instance, may well date to the time that the Egyptian pharaoh was expecting the arrival of foes.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe identity of the foes remained a question. The evidence suggests that some of the Sea Peoples may have been Greek. However, most of the destroyed Mycenaean sites are far from the sea, and the expedition against [[Troy]] at the end of this period shows that the sea was safe. Desborough believes that the sea was safe in central and south Aegean in this period.<ref name=\"Mylonas pp. 231, 232\">{{harvnb|Mylonas |1966 |pp=230,231}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] suggests relying on tradition, especially that of [[Thucydides]]:<ref name=Wood>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Wood |title=In Search of the Trojan War |url=https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrojan00wood |url-access=registration |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |year=1987 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrojan00wood/page/251 251\u2013252] |isbn=0-452-25960-6}}</ref><blockquote>\"[L]et us not forget the legends, at least as models for what might have happened.

[[John Chadwick|Chadwick]], after following and critiquing the development of different views, in 1976 settled on a theory of his own:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chadwick |first=John |authorlink=John Chadwick |title=Who were the Dorians? |journal=Parola del Passato |volume=31 |pages=103\u2013117 |year=1976}} Chadwick's point of view is summarized and critiqued in {{harvnb|Drews|1988|loc=Appendix One: The End of the Bronze Age in Greece}}</ref> there was no Dorian invasion. The palaces were destroyed by Dorians who had been in the [[Peloponnesus]] all along as a subservient lower class (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc08\ud800\udc01\ud800\udc2b}}, ''do-e-ro'', \"male slave\"; latter Greek form: {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=346416 |title=Paleolexicon}}</ref>  and now were staging a revolution. Chadwick espoused the view that northern Greek was the more conservative language, and proposed that southern Greek had developed under Minoan influence as a palace language.\n\nMylonas joins two of the previous possibilities. He believes that some developments in Argolis and attempts for recovery after 1200 BC,  can be explained by an internal fighting, and by an enemy pressure, by the [[Dorians]]. Even if the Dorians were one of the causes of the [[Bronze age collapse]], there is evidence that they brought with them  some new elements of culture. It seems that the Doric clans moved southward gradually over a number of years, and they devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centres.<ref name=\"Mylonas pp. 231, 232\"/>\n\n==Invasion or migration==\n[[File:Wells Hellenic races.png|thumb|300px|The northern (to south) Dorian migration in [[H.G. Wells]]' ''The Outline of History'' (1920).]]\nAfter the [[Greek Dark Ages]], much of the population of the Peloponnesus spoke Dorian, while the evidence of [[Linear B]] and literary traditions, such as the works of [[Homer]], suggests that the population spoke [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] \u2013 [[Mycenaean Greek]] \u2013 before. In addition, society in the Peloponnesus had undergone a total change from states ruled by kings presiding over a [[Palace economy]] to a [[caste]] system ruled by a Dorian master ''ethnos'' at [[Sparta]].\n\nAccording to the scholar H. Michell:<ref name=Michell7>{{cite book |first=H. |last=Michell |title=Sparta |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1964 |page=7}}</ref> \"If we assume that the Dorian invasion took place some time in the twelfth century, we certainly know nothing of them for the next hundred years.\" Blegen admitted that in the [[Helladic period#LH|sub-Mycenaean period]] following 1200:<ref name=Blegen/> \"the whole area seems to have been sparsely populated or almost deserted.\"\n\nThe problem is that there are no traces of any Dorians anywhere until the start of the [[Geometric Art|Geometric period]] about 950 BC. This simple pottery decoration appears to be correlated with other changes in [[material culture]], such as the introduction of iron weapons and alterations in burial practices from Mycenaean group burials in [[tholos tomb]]s to individual burials and cremation. These can certainly be associated with the historical Dorian settlers, such as those of Sparta in the 10th century BC.<ref name=Michell7/> However, they appear to have been general over all of Greece; moreover, the new weapons would not have been used in 1200.\n\nThe scholars were now faced with the [[:wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of an invasion at 1200 but a resettlement at 950. One explanation is that the destruction of 1200 was not caused by them, and that the quasi-mythical return of the Heracleidae is to be associated with settlement at Sparta c. 950. It is possible that the destruction of the Mycenaean centres, was caused by the wandering of northern people (Dorian migration). They destroyed the palace of [[Iolcos]] (LH III C-1), the palace of [[Phthiotic Thebes|Thebes]] ( late LH III B), then they crossed [[Isthmus of Corinth]] (end of LH III B)  they destroyed [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Pylos]], and finally they returned northward. However Pylos was destroyed by a sea-attack, the invaders didn't leave behind traces of weapons or graves, and it cannot be proved that all the sites were destroyed about the same time <ref>G.Mylonas \" Mycenae and the Mycenaean age\"  pp. 227, 228</ref> It is also possible that the Doric clans moved southward gradually over a number of years, and they devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centres.<ref>G.Mylonas , \"Mycenae and the Mycenaean age\", pp.231, 232</ref>\n\n==Closing the gap==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Amphora protogeometric BM A1123.jpg|thumb|Athenian proto-geometric pottery.]]\n[[File:Horses manger Louvre A513.jpg|thumb|Geometric pottery, Dorian [[Argos]].]]\nThe quest for the Dorian invasion had begun as an attempt to explain the differences between Peloponnesian society depicted by [[Homer]] and the historical Dorians of classical Greece. The first scholars to work on the problem were historians researching the only resources available to them: the Greek legends. The philologists (later linguists) subsequently took up the challenge but in the end only brought the problem into sharper definition. Finally the archaeologists have inherited the issue. Perhaps some distinctively Dorian archaeological evidence will turn up or has turned up giving precise insight as to how and when Peloponnesian society changed so radically.\n\nThe historians had defined the [[Greek Dark Ages]], a period of general decline, in this case the disappearance of the [[palace economy]] and with it law and order, loss of writing, diminishment of trade, decrease in population and abandonment of settlements (destroyed or undestroyed), metals starvation and loss of the fine arts or at least the diminution of their quality, evidenced especially in pottery. By its broadest definition the dark age lasted between 1200 and 750, the start of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] or orientalizing period, when influence from the Middle East via the overseas colonies stimulated a recovery.\n\nA dark age of poverty, low population and metals starvation is not compatible with the idea of great population movements of successful warriors wielding the latest military equipment sweeping into the Peloponnesus and taking it over to rebuild civilization their way. This dark age consists of three periods of [[Greek art|art and archaeology]]: [[Helladic period#LH|sub-Mycenaean]], [[Protogeometric period|Proto-geometric]] and [[Geometric art|Geometric]]. The most successful, the Geometric, seems to fit the Dorians better, but there is a gap, and this period is not localized to and did not begin in Dorian territory. It is more to be associated with [[Athens]], an Ionian state.\n\nStill, the Dorians did share in the Geometric period and therefore to find its origin might be perhaps to find the origin of the Dorians. The Geometric originated by clear transition from the Proto-geometric. The logical break in material culture is the start of the Proto-geometric at about 1050 BC, which leaves a gap of 150 years. The year 1050 offers nothing distinctively Dorian either, but if the Dorians were present in the Geometric, and they were not always in place as an unrecorded lower class, 1050 is most likely time of entry. Cartledge says humorously:<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Cartledge |title=Sparta and Lakonia: A Regional History, 1300\u2013362 |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=68 |isbn=0-415-26276-3}}</ref><blockquote>\"It has of late become an acknowledged scandal that the Dorians, archaeologically speaking, do not exist. That is, there is no cultural trait surviving in the material record for the two centuries or so after 1200 which can be regarded as a peculiarly Dorian hallmark. Robbed of their patents for Geometric pottery, cremation burial, iron-working and, the unkindest prick of all, the humble straight pin, the hapless Dorians stand naked before their creator \u2013 or, some would say, inventor.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe question remains open to further investigation.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ancient Greek dialects]]\n*[[Comparative method]]\n*[[Dorians]]\n*[[Doric Greek]]\n*[[Doris (mythology)|Doris]]\n*[[Dorus]], the [[Eponym|eponymous founder]]\n*[[Greek Dark Ages]]\n*[[Historical linguistics]]\n*[[Sparta]]\n*[[Vedic Period]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|small=yes|colwidth=60em}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Drews |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Drews |title=The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcVIcaJxgdUC&pg=PP1 |year=1988 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02951-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Drews |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Drews |title=The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PP1 |year=1993 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02591-6}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Hall |first=Jonathan M. |author-link=Jonathan M.

The latter were named ''Dorian'' by the ancient Greek writers, after the [[Dorians]], the historical population that spoke them.\n\nGreek legend asserts that the Dorians took possession of the [[Peloponnesus]] in an event called the '''Return of the Heracleidae'''  ({{lang-grc|\u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u1f74 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f29\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd}}). Nineteenth-century Classical scholars saw in the legend a possibly real event they termed the ''Dorian invasion''. The meaning of the concept has changed several times, as historians, [[philologist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s used it in attempts to explain the cultural discontinuities expressed in the data of their fields. The pattern of arrival of Dorian culture on certain islands in the [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Crete]], is also not well understood. The Dorians colonised a number of sites on Crete such as [[Lato]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10847/lato.html#fieldnotes |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |title=Lato Hillfort |work=The Modern Antiquarian |date=10 January 2008 |publisher=Julian Cope}}</ref>\n\nDespite nearly 200 years of investigation, the historicity of a mass migration of Dorians into Greece has never been established, and the origin of the Dorians remains unknown.  Some have linked them or their victims with the emergence of the equally mysterious [[Sea Peoples]].  The meaning of the phrase \"Dorian invasion\" as an explanation for the cultural and economic breakdown after the [[Mycenaean period]] has become to some degree amorphous.  Investigations into it have served mainly to rule out various speculations, though the possibility of a real Dorian invasion remains open.\n\n==Return of the Heracleidae==\n[[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2648.jpg|thumb|300px|Heracles and Athena. an [[Attic Greek|Attic]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure vase]].]]\nClassical tradition, as recorded for example in Herodotus, describes the \"Return of the [[Heracleidae]]\" (\u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u1f74 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f29\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd), the descendants of [[Heracles]], who were exiled at his death and returned in later generations to reclaim the dominion that Heracles had held in the [[Peloponnesus]]. The Greece to which the tradition refers is the mythic one, now considered to be [[Mycenaean Greece]]. The details differ from one ancient author to another, the commonality being that a traditional ruling clan traced its legitimacy to Heracles.\n\nThe Greek words referring to the influx of the Dorians are ''katienai''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*k%3Aentry+group%3D84 |encyclopedia=Greek-English Lexicon |first=Henry George |last=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |year=2007 |origyear=1940 |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |location=Medford}}</ref> and ''katerchesthai'', literally \"to descend\",  \"come down\" or \"go down\" or, less commonly, \"be brought down.\" It means a descent from uplands to lowlands, or from earth to grave, or rushing down as a flood, or sweeping down as a wind, or those who have returned from exile by ship.  This sweeping down upon the Peloponnesus invited the English translation \"invasion\".\n\nThere is, however, a distinction between Heracleidae and Dorians. [[George Grote]] summarizes the relationship as follows:<ref name=GroteXVIII>George Grote, ''Greece'' Part I, Chapter XVIII, Section I: \"Return of the Herakleids into [[Peloponnesus]].\"</ref><blockquote>\"[[Herakles]] himself had rendered inestimable aid to the Dorian king [[Aegimius]], when the latter was hard pressed in a contest with the [[Lapithae]] .... Herakles defeated the Lapithae and slew their king [[Coronus (Greek mythology)|Koronus]]; in return for which Aegimius assigned to his deliverers one third part of his whole territory and adopted [[Hyllus]] as his son.\"</blockquote>Hyllus, a [[Perseus|Perseid]], was driven from the state of [[Mycenae]] into exile after the death of Heracles by a dynastic rival, [[Eurystheus]], another {{nowrap|Perseid:<ref name=GroteIV>George Grote, ''Greece'' Chapter IV: \"Heroic Legends : Exile of the Herakleids.\"</ref>}}\n<blockquote>\"After the death ... of Herakles, his son Hyllos and his other children were expelled and persecuted by Eurystheus ... Eurystheus invaded [[Attica]], but perished in the attempt .... All the sons of Eurystheus lost their lives ... with him, so that the Perseid family was now represented only by the Herakleids ....\"</blockquote>The [[Pelops|Pelopid]] family now assumed power. The Heraclids \"endeavored to recover the possessions from which they had been expelled\" but were defeated by the Ionians at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. Hyllus staked peace for three generations against immediate reoccupation on a single combat and was killed by [[Echemus]] of [[Arcadia]].\n\nThe Heracleidae now found it prudent to claim the Dorian land granted to Heracles:<ref name=GroteXVIII/> \"and from this moment the Herakleids and Dorians became intimately united together into one social communion.\" Three generations later the Heracleidae with Dorian collusion occupied the Peloponnesus, an event Grote terms a \"victorious invasion.\"<ref name=GroteIV/>\n\n==The term \"invasion\"==\n[[File:Rider BM B1.jpg|thumb|300px|A 6th-century BC cup from [[Laconia]], the very center of the classical Dorians, representing [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory, attending upon a Spartan warrior.]]\nThe first widespread use of the term \"Dorian invasion\" appears to date to the 1830s. A popular alternative was the \"Dorian migration\". For example, in 1831 Thomas Keightly was using \"Dorian migration\" in ''Outline of History''; by 1838 in ''The Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy'' he was using \"Dorian invasion\".\n\nNeither of those two words exactly fits the events, as they imply an incursion from outside a society to within; but the Dorians were not outside of either Greece or Greek society. [[William Mitford]]'s ''History of Greece'' (1784\u20131810)<ref>Mitford's single-volume first edition came out in 1784 to be followed by a second edition containing Volumes I and II in 1789. The remainder of the initial 8-volume set was published by 1810. The third edition of 1821 had more volumes. Some 29 editions more followed. Mitford's work features marginal notes stating the ancient sources.</ref> described a \"Dorian conquest\" followed by \"a revolution in Peloponnesus so complete that, except in the rugged province of Arcadia, nothing remained unaltered.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Mitford |title=The History of Greece |page=197 |volume=Volume I |location=Boston |publisher=Timothy Bedlington and Charles Ewer, Cornhill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vsAPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=Mitford+History+of+Greece#v=onepage&q=dorian%20revolution&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824 [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]'s ''Die Dorier'' was published in German and was translated into English by Tufnel and Lewis for publication in 1830. They use such terms as \"the Doric invasion\"<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|p=107}}.</ref> and \"the invasian of the Dorians\"<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|p=97}}.</ref> to translate M\u00fcller's \"Die Einwanderung von den Doriern\" (literally: \"the migration of the Dorians\"),<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1844|p=85}}.</ref> which was quite a different concept.\n\nOn one level the ''Einwanderung'' meant no more than the ''Heraklidenzug'', the return of the Heracleidae. However, M\u00fcller was also applying the sense of V\u00f6lkerwanderung to it, which was being used of the Germanic migrations. M\u00fcller's approach was [[philology|philological]]. In trying to explain the distribution of tribes and dialects he hypothesized that the aboriginal or [[Pelasgian]] population was Hellenic. His first paragraph of the ''Introduction'' asserts:<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=\"The Dorians derived their origin [''der Ursprung des dorischen Stammes''] from those districts in which the Grecian nation bordered toward the north upon numerous and dissimilar races of barbarians. As to the tribes which dwelt beyond these borders we are indeed wholly destitute of information; nor is there the slightest trace of any memorial or tradition that the Greeks originally came from those quarters.\"}}\n\nM\u00fcller goes on to propose that the original Pelasgian language was the common ancestor of Greek and Latin,<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> that it evolved into Proto-Greek and was corrupted in Macedon and Thessaly by invasions of Illyrians. This same pressure of Illyrians drove forth Greeks speaking Achaean (including Aeolian), Ionian, and finally Dorian in three diachronic waves, explaining the dialect distribution of Greek in classical times.<ref>{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|1830|pp=11\u201319}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing this traditional view, Thumb noticed that in the Peloponnesus and in the islands, where the Dorians established themselves, their dialect showed elements  of the [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]] dialect. This can be explained if the Dorians conquered a Pre-Doric population, which was pushed into the Arcadian mountains.

This view left M\u00fcller's proto-Greeks without a homeland, but Kretschmer did not substitute the Heracleidae or their Dorian allies from Macedon and Thessaly. Instead he removed the earliest Greeks to the trail leading from the plains of Asia, where he viewed the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] as having broken up about 2500 BC. Kretschmer suggested that somewhere between that Asian homeland and Greece a new cradle of the Greek tribes developed, from which Proto-Ionians at about 2000 BC, Proto-Achaeans at about 1600 BC and Dorians at about 1200 BC came to swoop down on an increasingly less aboriginal Greece as three waves of external Greeks.<ref>{{harvnb | Drews | 1988 | p=8}}: \"Paul Kretschmer concluded that there had been three Greek invasions of Greece during the Bronze Age. The last of these, ca. 1200 B.C., was surely the Dorian Invasion.\"</ref>\n\nKretschmer was confident that if the unknown homeland of the Greeks was not then known, archaeology would find it. The handbooks of Greek history from then on spoke of Greeks entering Greece. As late as 1956 [[J.B. Bury]]'s ''History of Greece'' (3rd edition) wrote of an \"invasion which brought the Greek language into Greece\". Over that half-century Greek and Balkan archaeology united in an effort to locate the Dorians further north than Greece. The idea was combined with a view that the [[Sea Peoples]] were part of the same north-south migration about 1200 BC.\n\nThe weakness in this theory<ref>A survey of the problems connected with the historicity of the \"Dorian invasion\" may be found {{cite book |first=J.M. |last=Hall |title=A History of the Archaic Greek World ca. 1200\u2013479 BCE |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |year=2007 |pages=Chapter 3 |id=A number of ISBN's, including 0631226672 |nopp=true}}</ref> is that it requires both an invaded Greece and an external area where Greek evolved and continued to evolve into dialects contemporaneously with the invaded Greece. However, although the invaded Greece was amply represented by evidence of all sorts, there was no evidence at all of the external homeland. Similarly, a clear Greek homeland for the Sea Peoples failed to materialize. Retaining M\u00fcller's three waves and Kretschmer's Pelasgian pockets the scholars continued to search for the Dorians in other quarters. M\u00fcller's common ancestor of Greek and Latin had vanished by 1950; and by 1960, although still given lip service, the concept of Greek developing outside of Greece was in decline.<ref>{{harvnb | Drews | 1993 |p=63}}: \"The old view \u2014 that the Dorian invasion proceeded from the central Balkans and that it occurred ca. 1200 \u2014 is now maintained by only a few archaeologists and against increasing evidence to the contrary.\"</ref>\n\n==Greek origin in Greece==\n[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|thumb|550px|The Greek dialects after the event or events termed \"the Dorian invasion.\" Before this, the dialect spoken in the later Dorian range (except for [[Doris (Greece)|Doris]] itself) is believed to have been Achaean, from which Attic, Ionic and Aeolic descended. Doric displaced Achaean in southern Greece.]]\nAdditional progress in the search for the Dorian invasion resulted from the decipherment of [[Linear B]] inscriptions.  The language of the Linear B texts is an early form of Greek now known as [[Mycenaean Greek]]. Comparing it with the later [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]] scholars could trace the development of the dialects from the earlier Mycenaean. For example, classical Greek ''[[anax|anak-s]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bd\u03b1\u03be}}), \"king\", was postulated to be derived from a reconstructed form ''*wanak-'' ({{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03be}}). In the [[Linear B]] texts appears the form {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc37\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc0f}}, ''wa-na-ka'', sometimes accompanied by the {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc37\ud800\udc00\ud800\udc2d}}, ''wa-na-sa'' ({{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}}, \"queen\").\n\nErnst Risch lost no time in proposing that there was never more than one migration, which brought [[proto-Greek]] into Greece. Proto-Greek is the assumed last common ancestor of all known varieties of [[Greek language|Greek]] and then dissimilated into dialects within Greece.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ernst |last=Risch |title=Die Gliederung der griechischen Dialekte in neuer Sicht |journal=Museum Helveticum |volume=12 |year=1955 |pages=61\u201375}} The argument is summarized, and Risch is cited, in {{harvnb | Drews | 1988 | p=39 }}.</ref>  Meanwhile, the linguists closest to the decipherment were having doubts about the classification of proto-Greek.

Indeed, the [[Linear B#Archives|Pylos tablets]] recorded the dispatch of \"coast-watchers\", to be followed not long after by the burning of the palace, presumably by invaders from the sea.

Blegen himself dated the Dorian invasion to 1200 BC.\n\nA destruction by Dorians has its own problems (as discussed in the next section) and is not the only possible explanation. At approximately this time [[Hittites|Hittite]] power in Anatolia collapsed with the destruction of their capital [[Hattusa]], and the late [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties of Egypt suffered invasions of the [[Sea Peoples]]. A theory, reported for instance by Thomas and Conant, attributes the ruin of the Peloponnesus to the Sea Peoples:<ref>{{cite book |first=Carol G. |last=Thomas |author2=Craig Conant |title=The Trojan War |publisher=The Greenwood press |location=Westport, Connecticut |page=18 |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32526-X}}</ref><blockquote>\"Evidence on the Linear B tablets from the Mycenaean kingdom of [[Pylos]] describing the dispatch of rowers and watchers to the coast, for instance, may well date to the time that the Egyptian pharaoh was expecting the arrival of foes.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe identity of the foes remained a question. The evidence suggests that some of the Sea Peoples may have been Greek. However, most of the destroyed Mycenaean sites are far from the sea, and the expedition against [[Troy]] at the end of this period shows that the sea was safe. Desborough believes that the sea was safe in central and south Aegean in this period.<ref name=\"Mylonas pp. 231, 232\">{{harvnb|Mylonas |1966 |pp=230,231}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] suggests relying on tradition, especially that of [[Thucydides]]:<ref name=Wood>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Wood |title=In Search of the Trojan War |url=https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrojan00wood |url-access=registration |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |year=1987 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrojan00wood/page/251 251\u2013252] |isbn=0-452-25960-6}}</ref><blockquote>\"[L]et us not forget the legends, at least as models for what might have happened.

[[John Chadwick|Chadwick]], after following and critiquing the development of different views, in 1976 settled on a theory of his own:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chadwick |first=John |authorlink=John Chadwick |title=Who were the Dorians? |journal=Parola del Passato |volume=31 |pages=103\u2013117 |year=1976}} Chadwick's point of view is summarized and critiqued in {{harvnb|Drews|1988|loc=Appendix One: The End of the Bronze Age in Greece}}</ref> there was no Dorian invasion. The palaces were destroyed by Dorians who had been in the [[Peloponnesus]] all along as a subservient lower class (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc08\ud800\udc01\ud800\udc2b}}, ''do-e-ro'', \"male slave\"; latter Greek form: {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=346416 |title=Paleolexicon}}</ref>  and now were staging a revolution. Chadwick espoused the view that northern Greek was the more conservative language, and proposed that southern Greek had developed under Minoan influence as a palace language.\n\nMylonas joins two of the previous possibilities. He believes that some developments in Argolis and attempts for recovery after 1200 BC,  can be explained by an internal fighting, and by an enemy pressure, by the [[Dorians]]. Even if the Dorians were one of the causes of the [[Bronze age collapse]], there is evidence that they brought with them  some new elements of culture. It seems that the Doric clans moved southward gradually over a number of years, and they devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centres.<ref name=\"Mylonas pp. 231, 232\"/>\n\n==Invasion or migration==\n[[File:Wells Hellenic races.png|thumb|300px|The northern (to south) Dorian migration in [[H.G. Wells]]' ''The Outline of History'' (1920).]]\nAfter the [[Greek Dark Ages]], much of the population of the Peloponnesus spoke Dorian, while the evidence of [[Linear B]] and literary traditions, such as the works of [[Homer]], suggests that the population spoke [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] \u2013 [[Mycenaean Greek]] \u2013 before. In addition, society in the Peloponnesus had undergone a total change from states ruled by kings presiding over a [[Palace economy]] to a [[caste]] system ruled by a Dorian master ''ethnos'' at [[Sparta]].\n\nAccording to the scholar H. Michell:<ref name=Michell7>{{cite book |first=H. |last=Michell |title=Sparta |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1964 |page=7}}</ref> \"If we assume that the Dorian invasion took place some time in the twelfth century, we certainly know nothing of them for the next hundred years.\" Blegen admitted that in the [[Helladic period#LH|sub-Mycenaean period]] following 1200:<ref name=Blegen/> \"the whole area seems to have been sparsely populated or almost deserted.\"\n\nThe problem is that there are no traces of any Dorians anywhere until the start of the [[Geometric Art|Geometric period]] about 950 BC. This simple pottery decoration appears to be correlated with other changes in [[material culture]], such as the introduction of iron weapons and alterations in burial practices from Mycenaean group burials in [[tholos tomb]]s to individual burials and cremation. These can certainly be associated with the historical Dorian settlers, such as those of Sparta in the 10th century BC.<ref name=Michell7/> However, they appear to have been general over all of Greece; moreover, the new weapons would not have been used in 1200.\n\nThe scholars were now faced with the [[:wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of an invasion at 1200 but a resettlement at 950. One explanation is that the destruction of 1200 was not caused by them, and that the quasi-mythical return of the Heracleidae is to be associated with settlement at Sparta c. 950. It is possible that the destruction of the Mycenaean centres, was caused by the wandering of northern people (Dorian migration). They destroyed the palace of [[Iolcos]] (LH III C-1), the palace of [[Phthiotic Thebes|Thebes]] ( late LH III B), then they crossed [[Isthmus of Corinth]] (end of LH III B)  they destroyed [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Pylos]], and finally they returned northward. However Pylos was destroyed by a sea-attack, the invaders didn't leave behind traces of weapons or graves, and it cannot be proved that all the sites were destroyed about the same time <ref>G.Mylonas \" Mycenae and the Mycenaean age\"  pp. 227, 228</ref> It is also possible that the Doric clans moved southward gradually over a number of years, and they devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centres.<ref>G.Mylonas , \"Mycenae and the Mycenaean age\", pp.231, 232</ref>\n\n==Closing the gap==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Amphora protogeometric BM A1123.jpg|thumb|Athenian proto-geometric pottery.]]\n[[File:Horses manger Louvre A513.jpg|thumb|Geometric pottery, Dorian [[Argos]].]]\nThe quest for the Dorian invasion had begun as an attempt to explain the differences between Peloponnesian society depicted by [[Homer]] and the historical Dorians of classical Greece. The first scholars to work on the problem were historians researching the only resources available to them: the Greek legends. The philologists (later linguists) subsequently took up the challenge but in the end only brought the problem into sharper definition. Finally the archaeologists have inherited the issue. Perhaps some distinctively Dorian archaeological evidence will turn up or has turned up giving precise insight as to how and when Peloponnesian society changed so radically.\n\nThe historians had defined the [[Greek Dark Ages]], a period of general decline, in this case the disappearance of the [[palace economy]] and with it law and order, loss of writing, diminishment of trade, decrease in population and abandonment of settlements (destroyed or undestroyed), metals starvation and loss of the fine arts or at least the diminution of their quality, evidenced especially in pottery. By its broadest definition the dark age lasted between 1200 and 750, the start of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] or orientalizing period, when influence from the Middle East via the overseas colonies stimulated a recovery.\n\nA dark age of poverty, low population and metals starvation is not compatible with the idea of great population movements of successful warriors wielding the latest military equipment sweeping into the Peloponnesus and taking it over to rebuild civilization their way. This dark age consists of three periods of [[Greek art|art and archaeology]]: [[Helladic period#LH|sub-Mycenaean]], [[Protogeometric period|Proto-geometric]] and [[Geometric art|Geometric]]. The most successful, the Geometric, seems to fit the Dorians better, but there is a gap, and this period is not localized to and did not begin in Dorian territory. It is more to be associated with [[Athens]], an Ionian state.\n\nStill, the Dorians did share in the Geometric period and therefore to find its origin might be perhaps to find the origin of the Dorians. The Geometric originated by clear transition from the Proto-geometric. The logical break in material culture is the start of the Proto-geometric at about 1050 BC, which leaves a gap of 150 years. The year 1050 offers nothing distinctively Dorian either, but if the Dorians were present in the Geometric, and they were not always in place as an unrecorded lower class, 1050 is most likely time of entry. Cartledge says humorously:<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Cartledge |title=Sparta and Lakonia: A Regional History, 1300\u2013362 |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=68 |isbn=0-415-26276-3}}</ref><blockquote>\"It has of late become an acknowledged scandal that the Dorians, archaeologically speaking, do not exist. That is, there is no cultural trait surviving in the material record for the two centuries or so after 1200 which can be regarded as a peculiarly Dorian hallmark. Robbed of their patents for Geometric pottery, cremation burial, iron-working and, the unkindest prick of all, the humble straight pin, the hapless Dorians stand naked before their creator \u2013 or, some would say, inventor.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe question remains open to further investigation.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ancient Greek dialects]]\n*[[Comparative method]]\n*[[Dorians]]\n*[[Doric Greek]]\n*[[Doris (mythology)|Doris]]\n*[[Dorus]], the [[Eponym|eponymous founder]]\n*[[Greek Dark Ages]]\n*[[Historical linguistics]]\n*[[Sparta]]\n*[[Vedic Period]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|small=yes|colwidth=60em}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Drews |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Drews |title=The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcVIcaJxgdUC&pg=PP1 |year=1988 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02951-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Drews |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Drews |title=The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PP1 |year=1993 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02591-6}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Hall |first=Jonathan M. |author-link=Jonathan M.

He first published his result  slightly later than [[Arthur Cayley]]'s article.<ref>{{harv|Graves|1845}}</ref> The octonions were discovered independently by Cayley<ref>{{Citation|first=Arthur |last=Cayley|title= On Jacobi's elliptic functions, in reply to the Rev..; and on quaternions|journal= [[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=26 |year=1845|pages=208\u2013211|doi=10.1080/14786444508645107|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431049}}.

Graves, Esq.|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro21iris}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe octonions can be thought of as octets (or 8-tuples) of real numbers. Every octonion is a real [[linear combination]] of the '''unit octonions''':\n\n:<math>\\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\\},</math>\n\nwhere <math>e_0</math> is the scalar or real element; it may be identified with the real number 1. That is, every octonion ''x'' can be written in the form\n:<math>x = x_0e_0 + x_1e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 + x_4e_4 + x_5e_5 + x_6e_6 + x_7e_7,\\,</math>\nwith real coefficients <math>\\{x_i\\}</math>.\n\nAddition and subtraction of octonions is done by adding and subtracting corresponding terms and hence their coefficients, like quaternions. Multiplication is more complex. Multiplication is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over addition, so the product of two octonions can be calculated by summing the products of all the terms, again like quaternions. The product of each pair of terms can be given by multiplication of the coefficients and a [[multiplication table]] of the unit octonions, like this one (due to Cayley, 1845, and Graves, 1843):<ref name=GSSV>{{Citation |title=Hypercomplex analysis |edition=Conference on quaternionic and Clifford analysis; proceedings |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-5v6pPpyb4C&pg=PA168 |page=168 |author=G Gentili, C Stoppato, DC Struppa and F Vlacci |chapter=Recent developments for regular functions of a hypercomplex variable|editor1=Irene Sabadini |editor2=M Shapiro |editor3=F Sommen |isbn=978-3-7643-9892-7 |year=2009 |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n  |\n  |\n  |colspan=\"8\" |<math>e_j</math>\n|-\n  | | \n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_ie_j</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_0</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_1</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_2</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_3</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_4</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_5</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_6</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_7</math>\n|-\n  | rowspan=\"8\" |<math>e_i</math>\n  !<math>e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n|-\n|}\n\nMost off-diagonal elements of the table are antisymmetric, making it almost a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] except for the elements on the main diagonal, as well as the row and column for which <math>e_0</math> is an operand.\n\nThe table can be summarized as follows:<ref name= Shestakov>\n\n{{Citation |title=Non-associative algebra and its applications |author1=Lev Vasil\u02b9evitch Sabinin |author2=Larissa Sbitneva |author3=I.

The 480 different algebras are isomorphic, and there is rarely a need to consider which particular multiplication rule is used.\n\n{{Confusing section|reason=does not match the multiplication table above, i.e. <math>e_1e_2 = e_3</math>|date=July 2019}}\nEach of these 480 definitions is invariant up to signs under some 7-cycle of the points (1234567), and for each 7-cycle there are four definitions, differing by signs and reversal of order. A common choice is to use the definition invariant under the 7-cycle (1234567) with {{nowrap|1=<math>e_1e_2 = e_4</math>}} as it is particularly easy to remember the multiplication.\n\nA variation of this sometimes used is to label the elements of the basis by the elements \u221e, 0, 1, 2, ..., 6, of the [[projective line]] over the finite field of order 7. The multiplication is then given by {{nowrap|1=<math>e_\\infty = 1</math>}} and {{nowrap|1=<math>e_1e_2 = e_4</math>}}, and all expressions obtained from this by adding a constant (mod 7) to all subscripts: in other words using the 7 triples (124) (235) (346) (450) (561) (602) (013). These are the nonzero codewords of the [[quadratic residue code]] of length 7 over the [[Finite field|Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)|''GF''(2)]]. There is a symmetry of order 7 given by adding a constant mod 7 to all subscripts, and also a symmetry of order 3 given by multiplying all subscripts by one of the quadratic residues 1, 2, 4 mod 7.<ref name=Parra>{{Citation |title=Clifford algebras with numeric and symbolic computations |author1=Rafa\u0142 Ab\u0142amowicz |author2=Pertti Lounesto |author3=Josep M.

If the \u2217 is forced to be equal to the identity then the multiplication ceases to be associative, but the \u2217 may be removed from the multiplication table resulting in an octonion multiplication table.\n\nIn keeping  {{nowrap|1=\u2217 = mijk}} associative and thus not reducing the 4-dimensional geometric algebra to an octonion one, the whole multiplication table can be derived from the equation for \u2217. Consider the [[gamma matrices]]. The formula defining the fifth gamma matrix shows that it is the \u2217 of a four-dimensional geometric algebra of the gamma matrices.\n\n===Cayley\u2013Dickson construction===\n{{Main|Cayley\u2013Dickson construction}}\nA more systematic way of defining the octonions is via the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction. Just as quaternions can be defined as pairs of complex numbers, the octonions can be defined as pairs of quaternions. Addition is defined pairwise. The product of two pairs of quaternions {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}} is defined by\n:<math>(a,b)(c,d)=(ac-d^{*}b,da+bc^{*}),</math>\nwhere <math>z^{*}</math> denotes the [[Quaternion#Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocal|conjugate of the quaternion]] ''z''.

The lines are directional. The seven points correspond to the seven standard basis elements of Im('''O''') (see definition [[#Conjugate, norm, and inverse|below]]). Each pair of distinct points lies on a unique line and each line runs through exactly three points.\n\nLet {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be an ordered triple of points lying on a given line with the order specified by the direction of the arrow. Then multiplication is given by\n\n:''ab'' = ''c'' and ''ba'' = \u2212''c''\n\ntogether with [[cyclic permutation]]s. These rules together with\n\n*1 is the multiplicative identity,\n*<math>e_i ^2 = -1</math> for each point in the diagram\n\ncompletely defines the multiplicative structure of the octonions. Each of the seven lines generates a subalgebra of '''O''' isomorphic to the quaternions '''H'''.\n\n===Conjugate, norm, and inverse===\nThe ''conjugate'' of an octonion\n\n:<math>x = x_0\\,e_0 + x_1\\,e_1 + x_2\\,e_2 + x_3\\,e_3 + x_4\\,e_4 + x_5\\,e_5 + x_6\\,e_6 + x_7\\,e_7</math>\n\nis given by\n\n:<math>x^* = x_0\\,e_0 - x_1\\,e_1 - x_2\\,e_2 - x_3\\,e_3 - x_4\\,e_4 - x_5\\,e_5 - x_6\\,e_6 - x_7\\,e_7.</math>\nConjugation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of '''O''' and satisfies {{nowrap|1=''(xy)''<sup>\u2217</sup> = ''y''<sup>\u2217</sup> ''x''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} (note the change in order).\n\nThe ''real part'' of ''x'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\frac{x + x^*}{2} = x_0\\,e_0</math>\n\nand the ''imaginary part'' by\n\n:<math>\\frac{x - x^*}{2} = x_1\\,e_1 + x_2\\,e_2 + x_3\\,e_3 + x_4\\,e_4 + x_5\\,e_5 + x_6\\,e_6 + x_7\\,e_7.</math>\n\nThe set of all purely imaginary octonions span a 7 dimension subspace of '''O''', denoted Im('''O''').\n\nConjugation of octonions satisfies the equation\n\n:<math>x^* =-\\frac{1}{6} (x+(e_1x)e_1+(e_2x)e_2+(e_3x)e_3+(e_4x)e_4+(e_5x)e_5+(e_6x)e_6+(e_7x)e_7).</math>\n\nThe product of an octonion with its conjugate, {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>\u2217</sup> ''x'' = ''x'' ''x''<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, is always a nonnegative real number:\n\n:<math>x^*x = x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2.</math>\n\nUsing this the norm of an octonion can be defined, as\n\n:<math>\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{x^*x}.</math>\n\nThis norm agrees with the standard [[Euclidean norm]] on '''R'''<sup>8</sup>.\n\nThe existence of a norm on '''O''' implies the existence of [[inverse element|inverses]] for every nonzero element of '''O'''. The inverse of {{nowrap|''x'' \u2260 0}} is given by\n\n:<math>x^{-1} = \\frac {x^*}{\\|x\\|^2}.</math>\n\nIt satisfies {{nowrap|1=''x'' ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> = ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> ''x'' = 1}}.\n\n==Properties==\nOctonionic multiplication is neither [[commutative]]:\n\n:<math>e_ie_j = -e_je_i \\neq e_je_i\\,</math> if <math>i, j</math> are distinct and non-zero,\n\nnor [[associative]]:\n\n:<math>(e_ie_j)e_k = -e_i(e_je_k) \\neq e_i(e_je_k)\\,</math> if <math>i, j, k</math> are distinct, non-zero and <math>e_ie_j \\neq\\pm e_k</math>.\n\nThe octonions do satisfy a weaker form of associativity: they are alternative. This means that the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is associative. Actually, one can show that the subalgebra generated by any two elements of '''O''' is [[isomorphic]] to '''R''', '''C''', or '''H''', all of which are associative. Because of their non-associativity, octonions do not have matrix representations, unlike quaternions.\n\nThe octonions do retain one important property shared by '''R''', '''C''', and '''H''': the norm on '''O''' satisfies\n\n:<math>\\|xy\\| = \\|x\\|\\|y\\|</math>\n\nThis equation means that the octonions form a [[composition algebra]]. The higher-dimensional algebras defined by the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction (e.g., the sedenions) all fail to satisfy this property. They all have [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nWider number systems exist which have a multiplicative modulus (e.g. 16-dimensional conic sedenions). Their modulus is defined differently from their norm, and they also contain zero divisors.\n\nAs shown by [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]], '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O''' are the only normed division algebras over the reals. These four algebras also form the only alternative, finite-dimensional division algebras over the reals ([[up to]] isomorphism).\n\nNot being associative, the nonzero elements of '''O''' do not form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. They do, however, form a [[loop (algebra)|loop]], indeed a [[Moufang loop]].\n\n===Commutator and cross product===\nThe [[commutator]] of two octonions ''x'' and ''y'' is given by\n\n:<math>[x, y] = xy - yx.</math>\n\nThis is antisymmetric and imaginary. If it is considered only as a product on the imaginary subspace Im('''O''') it defines a product on that space, the [[seven-dimensional cross product]], given by\n\n:<math>x \\times y = \\frac{1}{2}(xy - yx).</math>\n\nLike the [[cross product]] in three dimensions this is a vector orthogonal to ''x'' and ''y'' with magnitude\n\n:<math>\\|x \\times y\\| = \\|x\\| \\|y\\| \\sin \\theta.</math>\n\nBut like the octonion product it is not uniquely defined. Instead there are many different cross products, each one dependent on the choice of octonion product.<ref>{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=pp. 37\u201338}}</ref>\n\n===Automorphisms===\nAn [[automorphism]], ''A'', of the octonions is an invertible [[linear transformation]] of '''O''' which satisfies\n\n:<math>A(xy) = A(x)A(y).</math>\n\nThe set of all automorphisms of '''O''' forms a group called [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>{{harv|Conway|Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 8.6}}</ref> The group ''G''<sub>2</sub> is a [[simply connected]], [[Compact group|compact]], real [[Lie group]] of dimension 14. This group is the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups and is isomorphic to the subgroup of Spin(7) that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8-dimensional real spinor representation. The group Spin(7) is in turn a subgroup of the group of isotopies described below.\n\n''See also'': [[PSL(2,7)]] \u2013 the [[automorphism group]] of the Fano plane.\n\n===Isotopies===\nAn [[isotopy of an algebra]] is a triple of bijective linear maps ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' such that if {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''z''}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''(''x'')''b''(''y'') = ''c''(''z'')}}. For {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''}} this is the same as an automorphism. The isotopy group of an algebra is the group of all isotopies, which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup.\n\nThe isotopy group of the octonions is the group Spin<sub>8</sub>('''R'''), with ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' acting as the three 8-dimensional representations.<ref>{{harv|Conway|Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 8}}</ref> The subgroup of elements where ''c'' fixes the identity is the subgroup Spin<sub>7</sub>('''R'''), and the subgroup where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' all fix the identity is the automorphism group ''G''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n==Applications==\nThe octonions play a significant role in the classification and construction of other mathematical entities. For example, the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]] is the automorphism group of the octonions, and the other exceptional Lie groups [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] can be understood as the isometries of certain [[projective plane]]s defined using the octonions.<ref>Baez (2002), section 4.</ref> The set of [[self-adjoint]] <math>3 \\times 3</math> octonionic matrices, equipped with a symmetrized matrix product, defines the [[Albert algebra]].

The simplest is just to take the octonions whose coordinates are integers. This gives a nonassociative algebra over the integers called the Gravesian octonions. However it is not a [[Order (ring theory)|maximal order]] (in the sense of ring theory); there are exactly 7 maximal orders containing it. These 7 maximal orders are all equivalent under automorphisms. The phrase \"integral octonions\" usually refers to a fixed choice of one of these seven orders.\n\nThese maximal orders were constructed by {{harvtxt|Kirmse|1925}}, Dickson and Bruck as follows. Label the 8 basis vectors by the points of the projective line over the field with 7 elements. First form the \"Kirmse integers\" : these consist of octonions whose coordinates are integers or half integers, and that are half integers (that is, halves of odd integers) on one of the 16 sets\n:\u2205 (\u221e124) (\u221e235) (\u221e346) (\u221e450) (\u221e561) (\u221e602) (\u221e013) (\u221e0123456) (0356) (1460) (2501) (3612) (4023) (5134) (6245)\nof the extended [[quadratic residue code]] of length 8 over the field of 2 elements, given by \u2205, (\u221e124) and its images under adding a constant mod 7, and the complements of these 8 sets. Then switch infinity and any one other coordinate; this operation creates a bijection of the Kirmse integers onto a different set, which is a maximal order. There are 7 ways to do this, giving 7 maximal orders, which are all equivalent under cyclic permutations of the 7 coordinates 0123456. (Kirmse incorrectly claimed that the Kirmse integers also form a maximal order, so he thought there were 8 maximal orders rather than 7, but as {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1946}} pointed out they are not closed under multiplication; this mistake occurs in several published papers.)\n\nThe Kirmse integers and the 7 maximal orders are all isometric to the [[E8 lattice|E<sub>8</sub> lattice]] rescaled by a factor of 1/{{radic|2}}. In particular there are 240 elements of minimum nonzero norm 1 in each of these orders, forming a Moufang loop of order 240.\n\nThe integral octonions have a \"division with remainder\" property: given integral octonions ''a'' and {{nowrap|''b'' \u2260 0}}, we can find ''q'' and ''r'' with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''qb'' + ''r''}}, where the remainder ''r'' has norm less than that of ''b''.\n\nIn the integral octonions, all left ideals and right ideals are 2-sided ideals, and the only 2-sided ideals are the principal ideals ''nO'' where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe integral octonions have a version of factorization into primes, though it is not straightforward to state because the octonions are not associative so the product of octonions depends on the order in which one does the products. The irreducible integral octonions are exactly those of prime norm, and every integral octonion can be written as a product of irreducible octonions. More precisely an integral octonion of norm ''mn'' can be written as a product of integral octonions of norms ''m'' and ''n''.\n\nThe automorphism group of the integral octonions is the group ''G''<sub>2</sub>('''F'''<sub>2</sub>) of order 12096, which has a simple subgroup of index 2 isomorphic to the unitary group <sup>2</sup>''A''<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2</sup>). The isotopy group of the integral octonions is the perfect double cover of the group of rotations of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Octonion algebra]]\n*[[Okubo algebra]]\n*[[Spin(8)]]\n*[[Split-octonion]]s\n*[[Triality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite journal | ref = harv| last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez| title = The Octonions | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | issn = 0273-0979 | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013205 | year = 2002 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-01-00934-X | arxiv = math/0105155| mr = 1886087}}\n* {{Cite journal | ref = harv| last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez| doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-05-01052-9 | title = Errata for ''The Octonions'' | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213\u2013214 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01052-9/S0273-0979-05-01052-9.pdf }}\n* {{Citation|authorlink=John Horton Conway|last1=Conway|first1=John Horton|last2=Smith|first2=Derek A.|year=2003|title=On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry|publisher=A.

Octonions have eight dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the [[quaternions]], of which they are an extension. They are [[commutative property|noncommutative]] and [[associative property|nonassociative]], but satisfy a weaker form of associativity; namely, they are [[alternative algebra|alternative]]. They are also [[Power associativity|power associative]].\n\nOctonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers, which are much more widely studied and used. Octonions are related to exceptional structures in mathematics, among them the [[Simple Lie group#Exceptional cases|exceptional Lie group]]s. Octonions have applications in fields such as [[string theory]], [[special relativity]] and [[quantum logic]]. Applying the [[Cayley\u2013Dickson construction]] to the octonions produces the [[sedenion]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe octonions were discovered in 1843 by [[John T. Graves]], inspired by his friend [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s discovery of quaternions. Graves called his discovery octaves, and mentioned them in a letter to Hamilton dated 16 December 1843. He first published his result  slightly later than [[Arthur Cayley]]'s article.<ref>{{harv|Graves|1845}}</ref> The octonions were discovered independently by Cayley<ref>{{Citation|first=Arthur |last=Cayley|title= On Jacobi's elliptic functions, in reply to the Rev..; and on quaternions|journal= [[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=26 |year=1845|pages=208\u2013211|doi=10.1080/14786444508645107|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431049}}.

Graves, Esq.|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro21iris}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe octonions can be thought of as octets (or 8-tuples) of real numbers. Every octonion is a real [[linear combination]] of the '''unit octonions''':\n\n:<math>\\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\\},</math>\n\nwhere ''e''<sub>0</sub> is the scalar or real element; it may be identified with the real number 1. That is, every octonion ''x'' can be written in the form\n:<math>x = x_0e_0 + x_1e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 + x_4e_4 + x_5e_5 + x_6e_6 + x_7e_7,\\,</math>\nwith real coefficients {''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}.\n\nAddition and subtraction of octonions is done by adding and subtracting corresponding terms and hence their coefficients, like quaternions. Multiplication is more complex. Multiplication is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over addition, so the product of two octonions can be calculated by summing the products of all the terms, again like quaternions. The product of each pair of terms can be given by multiplication of the coefficients and a [[multiplication table]] of the unit octonions, like this one (due to Cayley, 1845, and Graves, 1843):<ref name=GSSV>{{Citation |title=Hypercomplex analysis |edition=Conference on quaternionic and Clifford analysis; proceedings |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-5v6pPpyb4C&pg=PA168 |page=168 |author=G Gentili, C Stoppato, DC Struppa and F Vlacci |chapter=Recent developments for regular functions of a hypercomplex variable|editor1=Irene Sabadini |editor2=M Shapiro |editor3=F Sommen |isbn=978-3-7643-9892-7 |year=2009 |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n  |\n  |\n  |colspan=\"8\" |<math>e_j</math>\n|-\n  | | \n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_ie_j</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_0</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_1</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_2</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_3</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_4</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_5</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_6</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_7</math>\n|-\n  | rowspan=\"8\" |<math>e_i</math>\n  !<math>e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n|-\n|}\n\nMost off-diagonal elements of the table are antisymmetric, making it almost a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] except for the elements on the main diagonal, as well as the row and column for which {{math|''e''<sub>0</sub>}} is an operand.\n\nThe table can be summarized as follows:<ref name= Shestakov>\n\n{{Citation |title=Non-associative algebra and its applications |author1=Lev Vasil\u02b9evitch Sabinin |author2=Larissa Sbitneva |author3=I.

The others can be obtained by permuting and changing the signs of the non-scalar basis elements <math>\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\\}</math>. The 480 different algebras are isomorphic, and there is rarely a need to consider which particular multiplication rule is used. Each of these 480 definitions is invariant up to signs under some 7-cycle of the points (1234567), and for each 7-cycle there are four definitions, differing by signs and reversal of order. A common choice is to use the definition invariant under the 7-cycle (1234567) with {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub> = ''e''<sub>4</sub>}} {{Confusing|reason= does not match the multiplication table above, i.e. e1e2=e3|date=July 2019}} as it is particularly easy to remember the multiplication.\n\nA variation of this sometimes used is to label the elements of the basis by the elements \u221e, 0, 1, 2, ..., 6, of the [[projective line]] over the finite field of order 7.

These are the nonzero codewords of the [[quadratic residue code]] of length 7 over the [[Finite field|Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)|''GF''(2)]]. There is a symmetry of order 7 given by adding a constant mod 7 to all subscripts, and also a symmetry of order 3 given by multiplying all subscripts by one of the quadratic residues 1, 2, 4 mod 7.<ref name=Parra>\n\n{{Citation |title=Clifford algebras with numeric and symbolic computations |author1=Rafa\u0142 Ab\u0142amowicz |author2=Pertti Lounesto |author3=Josep M.

The lines are directional. The seven points correspond to the seven standard basis elements of Im('''O''') (see definition [[#Conjugate, norm, and inverse|below]]). Each pair of distinct points lies on a unique line and each line runs through exactly three points.\n\nLet {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be an ordered triple of points lying on a given line with the order specified by the direction of the arrow. Then multiplication is given by\n\n:''ab'' = ''c'' and ''ba'' = \u2212''c''\n\ntogether with [[cyclic permutation]]s.

Each of the seven lines generates a subalgebra of '''O''' isomorphic to the quaternions '''H'''.\n\n===Conjugate, norm, and inverse===\nThe ''conjugate'' of an octonion\n\n:<math>x = x_0\\,e_0 + x_1\\,e_1 + x_2\\,e_2 + x_3\\,e_3 + x_4\\,e_4 + x_5\\,e_5 + x_6\\,e_6 + x_7\\,e_7</math>\n\nis given by\n\n:<math>x^* = x_0\\,e_0 - x_1\\,e_1 - x_2\\,e_2 - x_3\\,e_3 - x_4\\,e_4 - x_5\\,e_5 - x_6\\,e_6 - x_7\\,e_7.</math>\nConjugation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of '''O''' and satisfies {{nowrap|1=''(xy)''<sup>\u2217</sup> = ''y''<sup>\u2217</sup> ''x''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} (note the change in order).\n\nThe ''real part'' of ''x'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\frac{x + x^*}{2} = x_0\\,e_0</math>\n\nand the ''imaginary part'' by\n\n:<math>\\frac{x - x^*}{2} = x_1\\,e_1 + x_2\\,e_2 + x_3\\,e_3 + x_4\\,e_4 + x_5\\,e_5 + x_6\\,e_6 + x_7\\,e_7.</math>\n\nThe set of all purely imaginary octonions span a 7 dimension subspace of '''O''', denoted Im('''O''').\n\nConjugation of octonions satisfies the equation\n\n:<math>x^* =-\\frac{1}{6} (x+(e_1x)e_1+(e_2x)e_2+(e_3x)e_3+(e_4x)e_4+(e_5x)e_5+(e_6x)e_6+(e_7x)e_7).</math>\n\nThe product of an octonion with its conjugate, {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>\u2217</sup> ''x'' = ''x'' ''x''<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, is always a nonnegative real number:\n\n:<math>x^*x = x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2.</math>\n\nUsing this the norm of an octonion can be defined, as\n\n:<math>\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{x^*x}.</math>\n\nThis norm agrees with the standard [[Euclidean norm]] on '''R'''<sup>8</sup>.\n\nThe existence of a norm on '''O''' implies the existence of [[inverse element|inverses]] for every nonzero element of '''O'''. The inverse of {{nowrap|''x'' \u2260 0}} is given by\n\n:<math>x^{-1} = \\frac {x^*}{\\|x\\|^2}.</math>\n\nIt satisfies {{nowrap|1=''x'' ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> = ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> ''x'' = 1}}.\n\n==Properties==\nOctonionic multiplication is neither [[commutative]]:\n\n:<math>e_ie_j = -e_je_i \\neq e_je_i\\,</math> if <math>i, j</math> are distinct and non-zero,\n\nnor [[associative]]:\n\n:<math>(e_ie_j)e_k = -e_i(e_je_k) \\neq e_i(e_je_k)\\,</math> if <math>i, j, k</math> are distinct, non-zero and <math>e_ie_j \\neq\\pm e_k</math>.\n\nThe octonions do satisfy a weaker form of associativity: they are alternative. This means that the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is associative. Actually, one can show that the subalgebra generated by any two elements of '''O''' is [[isomorphic]] to '''R''', '''C''', or '''H''', all of which are associative. Because of their non-associativity, octonions do not have matrix representations, unlike quaternions.\n\nThe octonions do retain one important property shared by '''R''', '''C''', and '''H''': the norm on '''O''' satisfies\n\n:<math>\\|xy\\| = \\|x\\|\\|y\\|</math>\n\nThis equation means that the octonions form a [[composition algebra]]. The higher-dimensional algebras defined by the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction (e.g., the sedenions) all fail to satisfy this property. They all have [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nWider number systems exist which have a multiplicative modulus (e.g. 16-dimensional conic sedenions). Their modulus is defined differently from their norm, and they also contain zero divisors.\n\nAs shown by [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]], '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O''' are the only normed division algebras over the reals. These four algebras also form the only alternative, finite-dimensional division algebras over the reals ([[up to]] isomorphism).\n\nNot being associative, the nonzero elements of '''O''' do not form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. They do, however, form a [[loop (algebra)|loop]], indeed a [[Moufang loop]].\n\n===Commutator and cross product===\nThe [[commutator]] of two octonions ''x'' and ''y'' is given by\n\n:<math>[x, y] = xy - yx.</math>\n\nThis is antisymmetric and imaginary. If it is considered only as a product on the imaginary subspace Im('''O''') it defines a product on that space, the [[seven-dimensional cross product]], given by\n\n:<math>x \\times y = \\frac{1}{2}(xy - yx).</math>\n\nLike the [[cross product]] in three dimensions this is a vector orthogonal to ''x'' and ''y'' with magnitude\n\n:<math>\\|x \\times y\\| = \\|x\\| \\|y\\| \\sin \\theta.</math>\n\nBut like the octonion product it is not uniquely defined. Instead there are many different cross products, each one dependent on the choice of octonion product.<ref>{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=pp. 37\u201338}}</ref>\n\n===Automorphisms===\nAn [[automorphism]], ''A'', of the octonions is an invertible [[linear transformation]] of '''O''' which satisfies\n\n:<math>A(xy) = A(x)A(y).</math>\n\nThe set of all automorphisms of '''O''' forms a group called [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>{{harv|Conway|Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 8.6}}</ref> The group ''G''<sub>2</sub> is a [[simply connected]], [[Compact group|compact]], real [[Lie group]] of dimension 14. This group is the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups and is isomorphic to the subgroup of Spin(7) that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8-dimensional real spinor representation. The group Spin(7) is in turn a subgroup of the group of isotopies described below.\n\n''See also'': [[PSL(2,7)]] \u2013 the [[automorphism group]] of the Fano plane.\n\n===Isotopies===\nAn [[isotopy of an algebra]] is a triple of bijective linear maps ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' such that if {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''z''}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''(''x'')''b''(''y'') = ''c''(''z'')}}. For {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''}} this is the same as an automorphism. The isotopy group of an algebra is the group of all isotopies, which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup.\n\nThe isotopy group of the octonions is the group Spin<sub>8</sub>('''R'''), with ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' acting as the three 8-dimensional representations.<ref>{{harv|Conway|Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 8}}</ref> The subgroup of elements where ''c'' fixes the identity is the subgroup Spin<sub>7</sub>('''R'''), and the subgroup where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' all fix the identity is the automorphism group ''G''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n==Applications==\nThe octonions play a significant role in the classification and construction of other mathematical entities. For example, the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]] is the automorphism group of the octonions, and the other exceptional Lie groups [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] can be understood as the isometries of certain [[projective plane]]s defined using the octonions.<ref>Baez (2002), section 4.</ref> The set of [[self-adjoint]] <math>3 \\times 3</math> octonionic matrices, equipped with a symmetrized matrix product, defines the [[Albert algebra]]. In discrete mathematics, the octonions provide an elementary derivation of the [[Leech lattice]], and thus they are closely related to the [[sporadic simple groups]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson |first=Robert A. |author-link=Robert Arnott Wilson |title=Octonions and the Leech lattice |journal=[[Journal of Algebra]] |volume=322 |issue=6 |date=2009-09-15 |pages=2186\u20132190 |doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2009.03.021 |url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/%7Eraw/pubs_files/octoLeech1rev.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson |first=Robert A. |author-link=Robert Arnott Wilson |title=Conway's group and octonions |journal=Journal of Group Theory |date=2010-08-13 |doi=10.1515/jgt.2010.038 |volume=14 |pages=1\u20138 |url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/pubs_files/octoConway.pdf}}</ref>\n\nApplications of the octonions to physics have largely been conjectural.

The simplest is just to take the octonions whose coordinates are integers. This gives a nonassociative algebra over the integers called the Gravesian octonions. However it is not a [[Order (ring theory)|maximal order]] (in the sense of ring theory); there are exactly 7 maximal orders containing it. These 7 maximal orders are all equivalent under automorphisms. The phrase \"integral octonions\" usually refers to a fixed choice of one of these seven orders.\n\nThese maximal orders were constructed by {{harvtxt|Kirmse|1925}}, Dickson and Bruck as follows. Label the 8 basis vectors by the points of the projective line over the field with 7 elements. First form the \"Kirmse integers\" : these consist of octonions whose coordinates are integers or half integers, and that are half integers (that is, halves of odd integers) on one of the 16 sets\n:\u2205 (\u221e124) (\u221e235) (\u221e346) (\u221e450) (\u221e561) (\u221e602) (\u221e013) (\u221e0123456) (0356) (1460) (2501) (3612) (4023) (5134) (6245)\nof the extended [[quadratic residue code]] of length 8 over the field of 2 elements, given by \u2205, (\u221e124) and its images under adding a constant mod 7, and the complements of these 8 sets. Then switch infinity and any one other coordinate; this operation creates a bijection of the Kirmse integers onto a different set, which is a maximal order. There are 7 ways to do this, giving 7 maximal orders, which are all equivalent under cyclic permutations of the 7 coordinates 0123456. (Kirmse incorrectly claimed that the Kirmse integers also form a maximal order, so he thought there were 8 maximal orders rather than 7, but as {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1946}} pointed out they are not closed under multiplication; this mistake occurs in several published papers.)\n\nThe Kirmse integers and the 7 maximal orders are all isometric to the [[E8 lattice|E<sub>8</sub> lattice]] rescaled by a factor of 1/{{radic|2}}. In particular there are 240 elements of minimum nonzero norm 1 in each of these orders, forming a Moufang loop of order 240.\n\nThe integral octonions have a \"division with remainder\" property: given integral octonions ''a'' and {{nowrap|''b'' \u2260 0}}, we can find ''q'' and ''r'' with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''qb'' + ''r''}}, where the remainder ''r'' has norm less than that of ''b''.\n\nIn the integral octonions, all left ideals and right ideals are 2-sided ideals, and the only 2-sided ideals are the principal ideals ''nO'' where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe integral octonions have a version of factorization into primes, though it is not straightforward to state because the octonions are not associative so the product of octonions depends on the order in which one does the products. The irreducible integral octonions are exactly those of prime norm, and every integral octonion can be written as a product of irreducible octonions. More precisely an integral octonion of norm ''mn'' can be written as a product of integral octonions of norms ''m'' and ''n''.\n\nThe automorphism group of the integral octonions is the group ''G''<sub>2</sub>('''F'''<sub>2</sub>) of order 12096, which has a simple subgroup of index 2 isomorphic to the unitary group <sup>2</sup>''A''<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2</sup>). The isotopy group of the integral octonions is the perfect double cover of the group of rotations of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Octonion algebra]]\n*[[Okubo algebra]]\n*[[Spin(8)]]\n*[[Split-octonion]]s\n*[[Triality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite journal | ref = harv| last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez| title = The Octonions | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | issn = 0273-0979 | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013205 | year = 2002 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-01-00934-X | arxiv = math/0105155| mr = 1886087}}\n* {{Cite journal | ref = harv| last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez| doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-05-01052-9 | title = Errata for ''The Octonions'' | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213\u2013214 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01052-9/S0273-0979-05-01052-9.pdf }}\n* {{Citation|authorlink=John Horton Conway|last1=Conway|first1=John Horton|last2=Smith|first2=Derek A.|year=2003|title=On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry|publisher=A.
