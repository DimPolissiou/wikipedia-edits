In his audition tape, Safran was required to submit ten seconds of black, but instead he submitted ten seconds of [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Scarlet de Mason, Adam Shand and Varcha Sidwell |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/pagan-scarlet-de-mason |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=22 January 2012 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nSafran started the race off timid and tame, being locked inside an [[Osaka Municipal Subway|Osaka subway station]] in his first entry. However, he quickly broke what he called the \"fear barrier\" to film his now famous segments. He ran [[streaking]] naked through the streets of [[Jerusalem]] wearing only the scarf and beanie of his favourite football club, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] to prove that God is Jewish (St Kilda's only Grand Final win fell on the same day as [[Yom Kippur]]).<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/> He was baptised and placed a [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] curse on his ex-girlfriend in the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/> He snuck into [[Disneyland]] via a work area and attached information plaques he made about founder [[Walt Disney]] to a display (highlighting little known Disney \"facts\" such as Walt Disney's alleged early support for [[Adolf Hitler]]) and got a Catholic priest to review [[death metal]] music.\n\nSafran's segments scored well with both the judges and the public audience, Safran topped the viewer poll. He was, however, disqualified for a segment taped in a [[confessional]] booth (the program forbade [[hidden camera]] footage), the disqualification of the segment and subsequent loss of points meant that he finished last in the first season of ''Race Around the World''.\n\n==After the race (1997-2002)==\nAfter this brush with fame the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] commissioned two 30-minute TV pilots from Safran.\n\nOne pilot called ''John Safran: Media Tycoon'' focused on the media industry, airing in 1998. It became famous for a segment, involving then host of tabloid current affairs TV show ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', where Safran harassed him in the style characteristic of ''A Current Affair'' by sorting through his bin, which was later satirised by comedian [[Shaun Micallef]]. [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]  had set-up members of the Paxton family. Safran and one of the victims, Shane Paxton, turned up to [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]'s home. Martin and his wife Dianne physically threatened Safran.<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/> Martin's wife ripped apart Safran's Papier M\u00e2ch\u00e9 hat and Ray grabbed Safran by the collar, prompting Shane Paxton to intervene. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he's spoken to Roger Grant the then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC.<ref name=\"tvtonight.com.au\">{{cite magazine |last=Knox |first=David |date=26 April 2014 |title=John Safran still a sore point for Ray Martin |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/04/john-safran-still-a-sore-point-for-ray-martin.html |magazine=TV Tonight |location=Australia|publisher= |access-date= }}</ref> Martin's connection with this executive at the ABC is suspected to be a reason the series never made it to air. The Ray Martin segment was later played on ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', ''John Safran: The Lost Pilot'' and on YouTube.<ref name=\"tvtonight.com.au\"/> In 2014, Martin still appeared bitter about the incident, calling Safran a \"serial pest\".<ref name=\"tvtonight.com.au\"/>\n\nThe second pilot was titled ''John Safran: Master Chef''. This pilot focused on the food industry. Notably it featured a cooking segment where Safran prepared a beef dish. The twist comes when he arrives in an abattoir and shows detailed footage of cows being slaughtered to complete the dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craigmelville.com/safranabc/files/page25-1067-pop.html|title=Discontinued -- Prosite|author=Behance|publisher=|access-date=18 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330002352/http://www.craigmelville.com/safranabc/files/page25-1067-pop.html|archive-date=30 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though all unsuccessful, the pilots became hits via the Internet among university students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fuck-the-skull-of-jesus.mit.edu/safran.html|title=John Safran TV Pilots|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023085204/http://fuck-the-skull-of-jesus.mit.edu/safran.html|archivedate=23 October 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Safran also recorded a parody of [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s song \"[[Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)]]\" entitled \"Not the Sunscreen Song\" which includes lines such as \"Never live in [[Adelaide]], it's a hole\" and \"Remember, you can't get pregnant the first time you have sex\". It peaked at No. 20 in 1998 and was nominated for an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]]. In [[Triple M]]'s ''2005 Greatest Songs Ever Written and Performed Since the Beginning of Time'' poll, \"Not the Sunscreen Song\" came in at #706 \u2013 one spot above \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHZWrET2CUA|title=YouTube|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSafran also presented segments for the [[Seven Network]]'s now defunct ''[[Late Report]]'', some were also screened in the United Kingdom with [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Disinformation (TV series)|Disinformation]]'' program. Safran attained police attention for a stunt to try and coerce [[cricket]]er [[Shane Warne]] into breaking a \"no smoking\" clause in an advertising contract with a nicotine gum manufacturer. Safran drove a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the MCG pitch during a match. He was arrested for \"[[pitch invasion]]\", but the charges were dropped.<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/>\n\n==Documentaries==\n===''Music Jamboree''===\n{{Main article|John Safran's Music Jamboree}}\nIn 2002, Safran launched his documentary series ''John Safran's Music Jamboree''. On one occasion Safran and his crew stormed the courtyard of his former school and amid shocked religious students and teachers, he and his crew began to dance to the song \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\". He was also able to gain entry into an exclusive Melbourne night club by dressing up nine men as the band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Moskovitch |first=Greg |date=11 November 2014 |title=John Safran's 11 Greatest Music Moments |url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/425149/john-safrans-top-11-music-moments.htm |newspaper=Tone Deaf |location=Australia |access-date= }}</ref> Screened on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] on Saturday nights, it opened Safran's work to youth 12 to 20 years old, who had not seen the original ''Race Around the World'' material.

The first seven episodes were typical Safran informative satire. The series' finale featured Safran being [[exorcism|exorcised]] of demons which had supposedly [[Demonic possession|possessed]] him during his dabblings with world religions. The exorcism was performed by well-known Christian fundamentalist [[Bob Larson]]. It has been claimed that Safran's behaviour during the exorcism was faked.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Safran has neither confirmed nor denied faking his behaviour, but in an interview with an Australian radio personality, Safran did say that he \"felt something was going on\", and that \"there was something about the expression on my face\". In an interview on [[Andrew Denton]]'s ''[[Enough Rope]]'' program, he claimed that he had no memory of the events during the exorcism, and stated that the footage shown on the show was merely the most interesting from hours of footage. ''John Safran vs God'' won a 2005 [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Award]] for \"Best Comedy Series\".[https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/afi-award-winners-20051127-gdmixp.html]\n\nBefore the exorcism, Safran went to [[Mozambique]] to have a curse, previously placed on the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national football team]] by a now-deceased witch doctor, lifted. He and former Australian football team captain [[Johnny Warren]] were covered in chicken's blood in the process. Subsequently, on 16 November 2005, [[Football World Cup 2006 - Oceania-South America Qualification Playoff|Australia qualified]] for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time since 1974.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sygall |first=David |date=20 November 2005 |title=Socceroos owe it all to one man - and it isn't Hiddink |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/socceroos-owe-it-all-to-one-man--and-it-isnt-hiddink/2005/11/19/1132017026017.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydeny, New South Wales, Australia |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===''Speaking in Tongues''===\n{{Main article|Speaking in Tongues (TV show)}}\nIn 2005 and 2006, Safran co-hosted a television talk show entitled ''[[Speaking in Tongues (TV show)|Speaking in Tongues]]'' with [[Father Bob Maguire]], a Catholic priest who Safran met during the filming of ''John Safran vs God''.

First gaining fame appearing in ''[[Race Around the World]]'' in 1997, Safran went on to produce a series of documentaries, television shows and host radio programs.\n\nSafran is known for his television stunts, which include placing a fatwa on Australian television host [[Rove McManus]], sneaking nine young men into an exclusive [[Melbourne]] [[nightclub]] by disguising them as members of American [[nu metal]] band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], running through [[Jerusalem]] wearing nothing but the beanie and scarf of [[St Kilda Football Club]], driving a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], and his confrontation with tabloid current affairs host [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]].\n\nCurrently, he works as a journalist and released a book, ''[[Depends What You Mean By Extremist]]'', in May 2017.<ref name=\"depends\">{{cite web|url=https://penguin.com.au/books/depends-what-you-mean-by-extremist-9781926428772|title=Depends What You Mean by Extremist: Going Rogue with Australian Deplorables |publisher=Penguin Books Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSafran was born in [[Melbourne]] to Jewish parents.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\">{{Cite episode |title=John Safran |episode-link= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1217450.htm|access-date= |series=George Negus Tonight |series-link= |first=George |last=Negus |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station= |date=11 October 2004 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> His maternal grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] [[Bundism|Bundists]].<ref name=\"abc.net.au1\">{{Cite episode |title=John Safran |episode-link= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1383760.htm |access-date= |series=Sunday Profile |series-link= |first=Monica |last=Attard |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station= |date=5 June  2005 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Safran's mother, Gitl, was born in [[Uzbekistan]] as they were fleeing their home country for Australia.<ref name=\"smh.com.au1\">{{cite news |last=Doreian |first=Robyn |date=29 September 2013 |title=What I know about women |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/what-i-know-about-women-20130924-2ubvz.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney, New South Wales, Australia |access-date= }}</ref> She died in 2003.<ref name=\"smh.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/what-i-know-about-women-20130924-2ubvz.html|title=What I know about women|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> His paternal ancestors were [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]] and left shortly before the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Katrina Lucas, Guy Rundle and Alex Safran|episode-link= |url=http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/triplej/safran/safran_2014_12_07.mp3 |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=7 December 2014 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> He has one older sister, Margaret.\n\nHe grew up in [[Balwyn North]] and attended North Balwyn Primary School, [[Balwyn High School]] and [[Yeshivah College, Australia|Yeshivah College]] from Year 8 onwards.<ref name=\"abc.net.au1\"/><ref name=\"smh.com.au\"/> He describes himself at Yeshivah, an all-boys Orthodox Jewish school, as being \"the least religious kid in the most religious school in Australia\".<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/> His best friends at Yeshivah were George Weinberg, Jeremy Weinstein, Raph Brous and Saskia Greta Sansom.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Nick Cater, Andreas Dalsgaard and Charles Virtue |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/nick-cater-andreas-dalsgaard |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=9 June 2013 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes=74:50 |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nAfter school he studied journalism at [[RMIT University]].

In his audition tape, Safran was required to submit ten seconds of black, but instead he submitted ten seconds of [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Scarlet de Mason, Adam Shand and Varcha Sidwell |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/pagan-scarlet-de-mason |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=22 January 2012 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nSafran started the race off timid and tame, being locked inside an [[Osaka Municipal Subway|Osaka subway station]] in his first entry. However, he quickly broke what he called the \"fear barrier\" to film his now famous segments. He ran [[streaking]] naked through the streets of [[Jerusalem]] wearing only the scarf and beanie of his favourite football club, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] to prove that God is Jewish (St Kilda's only Grand Final win fell on the same day as [[Yom Kippur]]).<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/> He was baptised and placed a [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] curse on his ex-girlfriend in the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/> He snuck into [[Disneyland]] via a work area and attached information plaques he made about founder [[Walt Disney]] to a display (highlighting little known Disney \"facts\" such as Walt Disney's alleged early support for [[Adolf Hitler]]) and got a Catholic priest to review [[death metal]] music.\n\nSafran's segments scored well with both the judges and the public audience, Safran topped the viewer poll. He was, however, disqualified for a segment taped in a [[confessional]] booth (the program forbade [[hidden camera]] footage), the disqualification of the segment and subsequent loss of points meant that he finished last in the first season of ''Race Around the World''.\n\n==After the race (1997-2002)==\nAfter this brush with fame the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] commissioned two 30-minute TV pilots from Safran.\n\nOne pilot called ''John Safran: Media Tycoon'' focused on the media industry, airing in 1998. It became famous for a segment, involving then host of tabloid current affairs TV show ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', where Safran harassed him in the style characteristic of ''A Current Affair'' by sorting through his bin, which was later satirised by comedian [[Shaun Micallef]]. [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]  had set-up members of the Paxton family. Safran and one of the victims, Shane Paxton, turned up to [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]'s home. Martin and his wife Dianne physically threatened Safran.<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/> Martin's wife ripped apart Safran's Papier M\u00e2ch\u00e9 hat and Ray grabbed Safran by the collar, prompting Shane Paxton to intervene. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he's spoken to Roger Grant the then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC.<ref name=\"tvtonight.com.au\">{{cite magazine |last=Knox |first=David |date=26 April 2014 |title=John Safran still a sore point for Ray Martin |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/04/john-safran-still-a-sore-point-for-ray-martin.html |magazine=TV Tonight |location=Australia|publisher= |access-date= }}</ref> Martin's connection with this executive at the ABC is suspected to be a reason the series never made it to air. The Ray Martin segment was later played on ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', ''John Safran: The Lost Pilot'' and on Youtube.<ref name=\"tvtonight.com.au\"/> In 2014, Martin still appeared bitter about the incident, calling Safran a \"serial pest\".<ref name=\"tvtonight.com.au\"/>\n\nThe second pilot was titled ''John Safran: Master Chef''. This pilot focused on the food industry. Notably it featured a cooking segment where Safran prepared a beef dish. The twist comes when he arrives in an abattoir and shows detailed footage of cows being slaughtered to complete the dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craigmelville.com/safranabc/files/page25-1067-pop.html|title=Discontinued -- Prosite|author=Behance|publisher=|access-date=18 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330002352/http://www.craigmelville.com/safranabc/files/page25-1067-pop.html|archive-date=30 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though all unsuccessful, the pilots became hits via the Internet among university students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fuck-the-skull-of-jesus.mit.edu/safran.html|title=John Safran TV Pilots|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023085204/http://fuck-the-skull-of-jesus.mit.edu/safran.html|archivedate=23 October 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Safran also recorded a parody of [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s song \"[[Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)]]\" entitled \"Not the Sunscreen Song\" which includes lines such as \"Never live in [[Adelaide]], it's a hole\" and \"Remember, you can't get pregnant the first time you have sex\". It peaked at No. 20 in 1998 and was nominated for an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]]. In [[Triple M]]'s ''2005 Greatest Songs Ever Written and Performed Since the Beginning of Time'' poll, \"Not the Sunscreen Song\" came in at #706 \u2013 one spot above \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHZWrET2CUA|title=YouTube|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSafran also presented segments for the [[Seven Network]]'s now defunct ''[[Late Report]]'', some were also screened in the United Kingdom with [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Disinformation (TV series)|Disinformation]]'' program. Safran attained police attention for a stunt to try and coerce [[cricket]]er [[Shane Warne]] into breaking a \"no smoking\" clause in an advertising contract with a nicotine gum manufacturer. Safran drove a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the MCG pitch during a match. He was arrested for \"[[pitch invasion]]\", but the charges were dropped.<ref name=\"abc.net.au2\"/>\n\n==Documentaries==\n===''Music Jamboree''===\n{{Main article|John Safran's Music Jamboree}}\nIn 2002, Safran launched his documentary series ''John Safran's Music Jamboree''. On one occasion Safran and his crew stormed the courtyard of his former school and amid shocked religious students and teachers, he and his crew began to dance to the song \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\". He was also able to gain entry into an exclusive Melbourne night club by dressing up nine men as the band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Moskovitch |first=Greg |date=11 November 2014 |title=John Safran's 11 Greatest Music Moments |url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/425149/john-safrans-top-11-music-moments.htm |newspaper=Tone Deaf |location=Australia |access-date= }}</ref> Screened on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] on Saturday nights, it opened Safran's work to youth 12 to 20 years old, who had not seen the original ''Race Around the World'' material. The show impressed the [[Australian Film Institute]] so much that it won an [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI award]] in 2003 for \"Best Comedy Series\" [https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/afi-award-winners-list-20031122-gdhu0y.html]\n\n===''John Safran vs God''===\n{{Main article|John Safran vs God}}\nIn August 2004 he debuted his new show ''John Safran vs God'', also on the SBS television network. The first seven episodes were typical Safran informative satire. The series' finale featured Safran being [[exorcism|exorcised]] of demons which had supposedly [[Demonic possession|possessed]] him during his dabblings with world religions. The exorcism was performed by well-known Christian fundamentalist [[Bob Larson]]. It has been claimed that Safran's behaviour during the exorcism was faked.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Safran has neither confirmed nor denied faking his behaviour, but in an interview with an Australian radio personality, Safran did say that he \"felt something was going on\", and that \"there was something about the expression on my face\". In an interview on [[Andrew Denton]]'s ''[[Enough Rope]]'' program, he claimed that he had no memory of the events during the exorcism, and stated that the footage shown on the show was merely the most interesting from hours of footage. ''John Safran vs God'' won a 2005 [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Award]] for \"Best Comedy Series\".[https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/afi-award-winners-20051127-gdmixp.html]\n\nBefore the exorcism, Safran went to [[Mozambique]] to have a curse, previously placed on the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national football team]] by a now-deceased witch doctor, lifted. He and former Australian football team captain [[Johnny Warren]] were covered in chicken's blood in the process. Subsequently, on 16 November 2005, [[Football World Cup 2006 - Oceania-South America Qualification Playoff|Australia qualified]] for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time since 1974.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sygall |first=David |date=20 November 2005 |title=Socceroos owe it all to one man - and it isn't Hiddink |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/socceroos-owe-it-all-to-one-man--and-it-isnt-hiddink/2005/11/19/1132017026017.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydeny, New South Wales, Australia |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===''Speaking in Tongues''===\n{{Main article|Speaking in Tongues (TV show)}}\nIn 2005 and 2006, Safran co-hosted a television talk show entitled ''[[Speaking in Tongues (TV show)|Speaking in Tongues]]'' with [[Father Bob Maguire]], a Catholic priest who Safran met during the filming of ''John Safran vs God''.

It has been part of the [[university]] since its founding, although its name has changed over time. It grants bachelor's degrees, and masters and doctorates through affiliation with the [[Cornell University Graduate School]]. Its major academic buildings are located on the Arts Quad and include some of the university's oldest buildings. The college offers courses in many fields of study and is the largest college at Cornell by undergraduate enrollment.\n\n==History==\nOriginally, the university's [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] was undifferentiated, but with the founding of the [[Cornell Law School]] in 1886 and the concomitant self-segregation of the school's [[lawyer]]s, different departments and colleges formed.\n\nInitially, the division that would become the College of Arts and Sciences was known as the Academic Department, but it was formally renamed in 1903. The College endowed the first professorships in [[American history]], [[musicology]], and [[American literature]].

His military and political acumen saved the gains of the first black insurrection in November 1791.

However, his achievements set the grounds for the black army's absolute victory and for [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] to declare the sovereign state of [[Haiti]] in January 1804.

He gradually established control over the whole island and used political and military tactics to gain dominance over his rivals. Throughout his years in power, he worked to improve the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labour, negotiated trade treaties with the United Kingdom and the United States, and maintained a large and well-disciplined army.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.7-8\">Cauna, pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nAfter defeating leaders among the [[free people of color]], in 1801, he promulgated an autonomist constitution for the colony, which named him as [[President for Life|Governor-General for Life]]. In 1802 he was invited to a parley by a French general, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, under false pretenses and arrested. He was deported to France and jailed, dying of pneumonia in 1803. Suffering massive losses in multiple historic battles at the hands of the Haitian army and losing many men of their forces to [[yellow fever]], the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from Saint-Domingue that very year. The Haitian Revolution continued under Louverture's lieutenant, Dessalines, who declared independence on 1 January 1804.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General Toussaint Louverture, pictured here on a Haitian banknote]]\nFor years little was known for certain about Toussaint Louverture's early life, as there were contradictory accounts and evidence about his life before the advent of the Haitian Revolution. The earliest records of his life are his recorded remarks and the reminiscences of his second legitimate son, Isaac Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.57\u201358</ref> Toussaint Louverture's parents are not known. John Beard's biography of Louverture claims that family traditions name his grandfather as [[Gaou Guinou]], a son of the [[Great Ardra|King of Allada]]. Louverture was the eldest of several children.<ref>Beard, pp.23\u201324</ref> Pierre Baptiste Simon is usually considered to have been his godfather.<ref>Korngold, page number needed.</ref>\n\nLouverture is thought to have been born on the plantation of Br\u00e9da at Haut de Cap in [[Saint-Domingue]], which was owned by the Comte de No\u00e9 and later managed by Bayon de Libertate.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360, 62</ref> His date of birth is uncertain, but his name suggests he was born on [[All Saints Day]], 1 November. He was probably about 50 at the start of the revolution in 1791.<ref>Bell, p.60</ref> Various sources have given birth dates between 1739 and 1746. Because of the lack of written records, Louverture may not have known his exact birth date.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360.</ref> In childhood, he earned the nickname ''Fatras-B\u00e2ton,'' suggesting he was small and weak, though he was to become known for his stamina and riding prowess.<ref>Beard, pp.26\u201327; Bell, p.60, 62</ref> An alternative explanation of Louverture's origins is that he was brought to Br\u00e9da by the new overseer Bayon de Libertate, who took up his duties in 1772.<ref>Bell, pp.66, 70, 72</ref>\n\n===Education===\nLouverture is believed to have been well educated by his godfather Pierre Baptiste, a [[free person of color]] who lived and worked on the Br\u00e9da plantation. Historians have speculated as to Louverture's intellectual background. His extant letters demonstrate a command of French in addition to [[Haitian Creole|Creole]]; and he reveals familiarity with [[Epictetus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] who had lived as a slave. His public speeches as well as his life's work, according to his biographers, show a familiarity with [[Machiavelli]].<ref name=\"Bell, p.61\">Bell, p.61</ref> Some cite [[Abb\u00e9 Raynal]], who wrote against slavery, as a possible influence:<ref>Bell, p.61; Beard, pp.30\u201336</ref> The wording of the proclamation issued by then rebel slave leader Louverture on 29 August 1793, which may have been the first time he publicly used the name \"Louverture\", seems to refer to an anti-slavery passage in Abb\u00e9 Raynal's \"A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies.\"<ref>Bell, p.18</ref><ref>Robin Blackburn.

It was the only slave revolt in the modern era that led to the founding of a [[Sovereign state|state]]. It is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred in the Americas.\n\n===The Rebellion: 1791\u20131794===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|right|Toussaint Louverture, as depicted in an 1802 French engraving]]\n\nBeginning in 1789, [[free people of color]] of Saint-Domingue were inspired by the [[French Revolution]] to seek an expansion of their rights and equality, while perpetuating the denial of freedom and rights to the slaves, who made up the overwhelming majority of population on the island. Initially, the slave population did not become involved in the conflict.<ref>Bell, pp.12\u201315; James, pp.81\u201382</ref> In August 1791, a Vodou ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] marked the start of a [[St. Domingue Slave Revolt|major slave rebellion]] in the north, which had the largest plantations and masses of slaves. Louverture apparently did not take part in the earliest stages of the rebellion, but after a few weeks he sent his family to safety in Spanish [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] and helped the overseers of the Breda plantation to leave the island. He joined the forces of [[Georges Biassou]] as doctor to the troops, commanding a small detachment.<ref>James, p.90; Bell, pp.23\u201324</ref> Surviving documents show him participating in the leadership of the rebellion, discussing strategy, and negotiating with the Spanish supporters of the rebellion for supplies.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\"/>\n\nIn December 1791, he was involved in negotiations between rebel leaders and the French Governor, [[Philibert Fran\u00e7ois Rouxel de Blanchelande|Blanchelande]], for the release of their white prisoners and a return to work in exchange for a ban on the use of the whip, an extra non-working day per week, and freedom for a handful of leaders.<ref>Bell, p.32-33</ref> When the offer was rejected, he was instrumental in preventing the massacre of Biassou's white prisoners.<ref>Bell, p.33</ref> The prisoners were released after further negotiations with the French commissioners and taken to [[Le Cap]] by Louverture. He hoped to use the occasion to present the rebellion's demands to the colonial assembly, but they refused to meet with him.<ref>Bell, pp.34\u201335</ref>\n\nThroughout 1792, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, Louverture ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the ''Cordon de l'Ouest,'' a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory.<ref>Bell, pp.42\u201350</ref> He gained a reputation for running an orderly camp, trained his men in [[guerrilla]] tactics and \"the European style of war\",<ref>Bell, pp.46</ref> and began to attract soldiers who would play an important role throughout the revolution.<ref>Bell, pp.28, 55</ref> After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General [[\u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux]], but it was in these battles that the French first recognised him as a significant military leader.<ref>Bell, p.50</ref>\n\nSome time in 1792\u201393, he adopted the surname Louverture, from the French word for \"opening\" or \"the one who opened the way\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Lester|title=The Americas in the Age of Revolution: 1750-1850|url=https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang|url-access=registration|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=[https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang/page/111 111]}}</ref> Although some modern writers spell his adopted surname with an apostrophe, as in \"L'Ouverture\", he did not, as his extant correspondence indicates. The most common explanation is that it refers to his ability to create openings in battle. The name is sometimes attributed to French commissioner Polverel's exclamation: \"That man makes an opening everywhere\". However, some writers think the name referred to a gap between his front teeth.<ref>Bell, p.56</ref>\n\nDespite adhering to royalist political views, Louverture had begun to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution.<ref>James, pp.125\u2013126</ref> From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition.<ref>Bell, pp.86\u201387; James, p.107</ref> \n\nOn 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the blacks of St Domingue:\n<blockquote>Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.<br /><br />Your very humble and obedient servant, Toussaint Louverture,<br /><br />General of the armies of the king, for the public good.<ref>Bell, p.18</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture Signature.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Toussaint Louverture's signature]]\n\nOn the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]], proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue,<ref>Bell, p.19</ref> hoping to bring the black troops over to his side.<ref>James, pp.128\u2013130</ref> Initially, this failed, perhaps because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.<ref>James, p.137</ref> However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, pp.141\u2013142</ref> For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general \u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux. During this time, competition between him and other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavour on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.<ref>Bell, pp.92\u201395</ref> In May 1794, when the decision of the French government became known in Saint-Domingue, Louverture switched allegiance from the Spanish to the French and rallied his troops to Laveaux.<ref>James pp.143\u2013144</ref>\n\n===Alliance with the French: 1794\u20131796===\n{{Slavery}}\nAfter months of skillful maneuvering that kept him on nominally good terms with the Spanish, while he also had secret correspondence with the new revolutionary French colonial government, Louverture officially joined the French in early May 1794, raising the republican flag over the port of [[Gona\u00efves]]. This provoked an exodus of refugees, both whites and free people of color, with many taking slaves with them.  In the first weeks, Louverture eradicated all Spanish supporters from the Cordon de l'Ouest, which he had held on their behalf.<ref>Bell, pp.104\u2013108</ref> \n\nHe faced attack from multiple sides. His former colleagues in the black slave rebellion were now fighting against him for the Spanish. As a French commander, he was under attack from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops who had landed on Saint-Domingue in September, as the British hoped to take advantage of the instability and gain control of the wealthy sugar-producing island.<ref>Bell, p.109</ref> On the other hand, he was able to pool his 4,000 men with Laveaux's troops in joint actions.<ref>James, p.143</ref> By now his officers included men who were to remain important throughout the revolution: his brother Paul, his nephew [[Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse|Mo\u00efse]], [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], and [[Henri Christophe]].<ref>James, p.147</ref>\n\nBefore long, Louverture had put an end to the Spanish threat to French Saint-Domingue. In any case, the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] of July 1795 marked a formal end to hostilities between the two countries. Black leaders [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Papillon|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois]] and [[Biassou]] continued to fight against Louverture until November, when they left for Spain and Florida, respectively. At that point, most of their men joined Louverture's forces.<ref>Bell, p.115</ref> Louverture also made inroads against the British troops, but was unable to oust them from [[Saint-Marc]]. He contained them and rendered them ineffective by returning to guerilla tactics.<ref>Bell, pp.110\u2013114</ref>\n\nThroughout 1795 and 1796, Louverture was also concerned with re-establishing agriculture and exports, and keeping the peace in areas under his control. In speeches and policy he revealed his belief that the long-term freedom of the people of Saint-Domingue depended on the economic viability of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.113, 126</ref> He was held in general respect, and resorted to a mixture of diplomacy and force to return the field hands to the plantations as emancipated and paid workers.<ref>James, pp.155\u2013156</ref> Workers regularly created small rebellions, protesting poor conditions, their lack of real freedom, or fearing a return to slavery. They wanted to establish their own small holdings and work for themselves, rather than on plantations.<ref>James, pp.152\u2013154</ref>\n\nAnother of Louverture's concerns was to manage potential rivals for power within the French part of the colony. The most serious of these was the [[mulatto]] commander [[Jean-Louis Villatte]], based in [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]]. Louverture and Villate had competed over the command of some sections of troops and territory since 1794. Villatte was thought to be somewhat racist towards black soldiers such as Louverture and planned to ally with [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of colour, after overthrowing French General \u00c9tienne Laveaux.<ref>Laurent Dubois and John Garrigus, ''Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, 1789\u20131804: A Brief History with Documents''. Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p.31</ref> In 1796 Villate drummed up popular support by accusing the French authorities of plotting a return to slavery. \n\nOn 20 March, he succeeded in capturing the French Governor Laveaux, and appointed himself Governor. Louverture's troops soon arrived at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to rescue the captured governor and drive Villatte out of town. Louverture was noted for opening the warehouses to the public, proving that they were empty of the chains that residents feared had been imported to prepare for a return to slavery. He was promoted to commander of the West Province two months later, and in 1797 was appointed as Saint-Domingue's top-ranking officer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\">Dubois and Garrigus, p.31</ref> Laveaux proclaimed Louverture as Lieutenant Governor, announcing at the same time that he would do nothing without his approval, to which Louverture replied, \"After God, Laveaux\".<ref>Bell, pp.132\u2013134; James, pp.163\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Third Commission: 1796\u201397===\nA few weeks after Louverture's triumph over the Villate insurrection, France's representatives of the third commission arrived in Saint-Domingue. Among them was [[Sonthonax]], the commissioner who had previously declared abolition of slavery on the same day as Louverture's proclamation of Camp Turel.<ref>Bell, p.136</ref> At first the relationship between the two men was positive. Sonthonax promoted Louverture to general and arranged for his sons, Placide and Isaac, to attend the school that had been established in France for the children of colonials.<ref>Bell, pp.137, 140\u2013141</ref>\n\nIn September 1796, elections were held to choose colonial representatives for the French national assembly. Louverture's letters show that he encouraged Laveaux to stand, and historians have speculated as to whether he was seeking to place a firm supporter in France or to remove a rival in power.<ref>Bell, pp.147\u2013148</ref> Sonthonax was also elected, either at Louverture's instigation or on his own initiative. While Laveaux left Saint-Domingue in October, Sonthonax remained.<ref>Bell, p.145, James, p.180</ref>\n\nSonthonax, a fervent revolutionary and fierce supporter of racial equality, soon rivalled Louverture in popularity. Although their goals were similar, they had several points of conflict.<ref>James, pp.174\u2013176; Bell, pp. 141\u2013142, 147</ref> They strongly disagreed about accepting the return of the white planters who had fled Saint-Domingue at the start of the revolution. To Sonthonax, they were potential counter-revolutionaries, to be assimilated, officially or not, with the \u2018[[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]\u2019 who had fled the French Revolution and were forbidden to return under pain of death. To Louverture, they were bearers of useful skills and knowledge, and he wanted them back.<ref>Bell, pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nIn summer 1797, Louverture authorised the return of Bayon de Libertat, the ex-overseer of Br\u00e9da, with whom he had a lifelong relationship. Sonthonax wrote to Louverture threatening him with prosecution and ordering him to get Bayon off the island. Louverture went over his head and wrote to the French [[Directoire]] directly for permission for Bayon to stay.<ref>Bell, p.150</ref> Only a few weeks later, he began arranging for Sonthonax's return to France that summer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\"/> Louverture had several reasons to want to get rid of Sonthonax; officially he said that Sonthonax had tried to involve him in a plot to make Saint-Domingue independent, starting with a massacre of the whites of the island.<ref>Bell, pp.150\u2013153</ref> The accusation played on Sonthonax's political radicalism and known hatred of the aristocratic white planters, but historians have varied as to how credible they consider it.<ref>James, pp.190, Bell, pp.153\u2013154</ref>\n\nOn reaching France, Sonthonax countered by accusing Louverture of royalist, counter-revolutionary, and pro-independence tendencies.<ref>Bell, p.153</ref> Louverture knew that he had asserted his authority to such an extent that the French government might well suspect him of seeking independence.<ref>Bell, pp.153, 155</ref> At the same time, the French Directoire government was considerably less revolutionary than it had been. Suspicions began to brew that it might reconsider the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, p.179</ref> In November 1797, Louverture wrote again to the Directoire, assuring them of his loyalty but reminding them firmly that abolition must be maintained.<ref>Bell, p.155</ref>\n\n===Treaties with Britain and the United States: 1798===\n[[File:Maitland and Louverture.jpg|thumb|right|''General [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] meets Louverture to discuss the secret treaty'']]\nFor several months, Louverture was in sole command of French Saint-Domingue, except for a semi-autonomous state in the south, where  general [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of color, had rejected the authority of the third commission.<ref>Bell, pp.142\u2013143</ref> Both generals continued attacking the British, whose position on Saint-Domingue was looking increasingly weak.<ref>James, p.201</ref> Louverture was negotiating their withdrawal when France's latest commissioner, [[Comte d'H\u00e9douville|Gabriel H\u00e9douville]], arrived in March 1798, with orders to undermine his authority.<ref>James, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nOn 30 April 1798, Louverture signed a treaty with the British general, [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], exchanging the withdrawal of British troops from western Saint-Domingue for an amnesty for the French counter-revolutionaries in those areas. In May, [[Port-au-Prince]] was returned to French rule in an atmosphere of order and celebration.<ref>James, pp.202, 204</ref>\n\nIn July, Louverture and Rigaud met commissioner H\u00e9douville together. Hoping to create a rivalry that would diminish Louverture's power, H\u00e9douville displayed a strong preference for Rigaud, and an aversion to Louverture.<ref>James, pp.207\u2013208</ref> However, General Maitland was also playing on French rivalries and evaded H\u00e9douville's authority to deal with Louverture directly.<ref>James, pp.211\u2013212</ref> In August, Louverture and Maitland signed treaties for the evacuation of the remaining British troops. On 31 August, they signed a secret treaty which lifted the British blockade on Saint-Domingue in exchange for a promise that Louverture would not export the black revolution to the British colony of [[Jamaica]], which also used slaves to produce sugar.<ref>Bell, pp.159\u2013160</ref>\n\nAs Louverture's relationship with H\u00e9douville reached the breaking point, an uprising began among the troops of his adopted nephew, Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse. Attempts by H\u00e9douville to manage the situation made matters worse and Louverture declined to help him. As the rebellion grew to a full-scale insurrection, H\u00e9douville prepared to leave the island, while Louverture and Dessalines threatened to arrest him as a troublemaker.<ref>James, pp.219\u2013220</ref> H\u00e9douville sailed for France in October 1798, nominally transferring his authority to Rigaud. Louverture decided instead to work with Phillipe Roume, a member of the third commission who had been posted to the Spanish parts of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.165\u2013166</ref> Though Louverture continued to protest his loyalty to the French government, he had expelled a second government representative from the territory and was about to negotiate another autonomous agreement with one of France's enemies.<ref>Bell, pp.166\u2013167</ref>\n\nThe United States had suspended trade with France in 1798 because of increasing conflict over piracy. The two countries were almost at war, but trade between Saint-Domingue and the United States was desirable to both Louverture and the United States. With H\u00e9douville gone, Louverture sent [[Joseph Bunel]] to negotiate with the government of [[John Adams]]. The terms of the treaty were similar to those already established with the British, but Louverture continually resisted suggestions from either power that he should declare independence.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Black Talleyrand: Toussaint L'Ouverture's Secret Diplomacy with England and the United States\", ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 66:1 (Jan. 2009), 87\u2013124.</ref> As long as France maintained the abolition of slavery, he appeared to be content to have the colony remain French, at least in name.<ref>Bell, pp.173\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Expansion of territory: 1799\u20131801===\n\nIn 1799, the tensions between Louverture and [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]] came to a head. Louverture accused Rigaud of trying to assassinate him to gain power over Saint-Domingue for himself. Rigaud claimed Louverture was conspiring with the British to restore slavery.<ref>Bell, pp.174\u2013175</ref> The conflict was complicated by racial overtones which escalated tension between blacks and mulattoes.<ref>Bell, pp.175\u2013177, 178\u2013179; James, pp.229\u2013230</ref> Louverture had other political reasons for bringing down Rigaud. Only by controlling every port could he hope to prevent a landing of French troops if necessary.<ref>James, pp.224, 237</ref>\n\nAfter Rigaud sent troops to seize the border towns of [[Petit-Goave]] and [[Grand-Goave]] in June 1799, Louverture persuaded Roume to declare Rigaud a traitor and attacked the southern state.<ref>Bell, p.177</ref> The resulting civil war, known as the [[War of Knives]], lasted over a year, with the defeated Rigaud fleeing to [[Guadeloupe]], then France, in August 1800.<ref>Bell, pp.182\u2013185</ref> Louverture delegated most of the campaign to his lieutenant, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who became infamous, during and after the war, for massacring mulatto captives and civilians.<ref>Bell, pp.179\u2013180</ref> The number of deaths is contested: the contemporary French general Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Pamphile de Lacroix suggested 10,000 deaths, while the 20th-century [[Trinidad|Trinidadian]] historian [[C.L.R. James]] later claimed there were only a few hundred deaths in contravention of the amnesty.<ref>James, p.236-237</ref>\n\nIn November 1799, during the civil war, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France and passed a new constitution declaring that the colonies would be subject to special laws.<ref>Bell, p.180</ref> Although the colonies suspected this meant the re-introduction of slavery, Napoleon began by confirming Louverture's position and promising to maintain abolition.<ref>Bell, p.184</ref> But he also forbade Louverture to invade Spanish Santo Domingo, an action that would put Louverture in a powerful defensive position.<ref>Bell, p.186</ref> Louverture was determined to proceed anyway and coerced Roume into supplying the necessary permission.<ref>Bell, pp.180\u2013182, 187</ref> \n\nIn January 1801, Louverture and Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse invaded the Spanish territory, taking possession from the Governor, Don Garcia, with few difficulties. The area had been less developed and less densely populated than the French section. Louverture brought it under French law, which abolished slavery, and embarked on a program of modernization. He was now master of the whole island.<ref>Bell, pp.189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Constitution of 1801===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture engraving.jpg|thumb|An early engraving of Louverture]]\nNapoleon had informed the inhabitants of Saint-Domingue that France would draw up a new constitution for its colonies, in which they would be subjected to special laws.<ref>Alexis, Stephen. ''Black Liberator.'' London: Ernest Benn Limited, 1949, p.165</ref> Despite his initial protestations to the contrary, the former slaves feared that he might restore slavery. In March 1801, Louverture appointed a constitutional assembly, composed chiefly of white planters, to draft a constitution for Saint-Domingue. He promulgated the Constitution on 7 July 1801, officially establishing his authority over the ''entire'' island of [[Hispaniola]]. It made him Governor-General for Life with near absolute powers and the possibility of choosing his successor. However, Louverture was not to explicitly declare Saint-Domingue's independence, acknowledging in Article 1 that it was a single colony of the French Empire.<ref>\"Constitution de la colonie fran\u00e7ais de Saint-Domingue\", Le Cap, 1801</ref>\nArticle 3 of the constitution states: \"There cannot exist slaves [in Saint-Domingue], servitude is therein forever abolished.

Article 6 states that \"the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman faith shall be the only publicly professed faith.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.141</ref>\n\nLouverture charged Colonel [[Charles Humbert Marie Vincent|Vincent]] with the task of presenting the new constitution to Napoleon, although Vincent was horrified to learn that the general had gone so far. Several aspects of the constitution were damaging to France: the absence of provision for French government officials, the lack of advantages to France in trade with its own colony, and Louverture's breach of protocol in publishing the constitution before submitting it to the French government. Despite his disapproval, Vincent attempted to submit the constitution to Napoleon in a positive light, but was briefly exiled to Elba for his pains.<ref>Philippe Girard, ''The Slaves Who Defeated Napol\u00e9on: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Haitian War of Independence'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, November 2011).</ref>\n\nLouverture identified as a Frenchman and strove to convince Bonaparte of his loyalty.

This may have contributed to a rebellion against forced labor led by his nephew and top general, Mo\u00efse, in October 1801. Because the activism was violently repressed, when the French ships arrived, not all of Saint-Domingue was automatically on Louverture's side.<ref>Bell, pp.206\u2013209, 226\u2013229, 250</ref> In late January 1802, while Leclerc sought permission to land at [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] and Christophe held him off, the Vicomte de [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] suddenly attacked [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]], effectively quashing the diplomatic option.<ref>Bell, pp.232\u2013234</ref>\n\nLouverture's plan in case of war was to burn the coastal cities and as much of the plains as possible, retreat with his troops into the inaccessible mountains, and wait for [[yellow fever]], which flourished on a seasonal basis, to decimate the European troops.<ref>Bell, pp.234\u2013236</ref> The biggest impediment to this plan proved to be difficulty in internal communications. Christophe burned Cap-Fran\u00e7ais and retreated, but Paul Louverture was tricked by a false letter into allowing the French to occupy Santo Domingo; other officers believed Napoleon's diplomatic proclamation, while some attempted resistance instead of burning and retreating.<ref>Bell, pp.234, 236\u2013237</ref> French reports to Napoleon show that in the months of fighting that followed, the French felt their position was weak, but that Louverture and his generals did not fully realize their strength.<ref>Bell, p.256-260</ref>\n\nWith both sides shocked by the violence of the initial fighting, Leclerc tried belatedly to revert to the diplomatic solution. Louverture's sons and their tutor had been sent from France to accompany the expedition with this end in mind and were now sent to present Napoleon's proclamation to Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.237\u2013241</ref> When these talks broke down, months of inconclusive fighting followed. On 6 May 1802, Louverture rode into Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to treat with Leclerc. He negotiated an amnesty for all his remaining generals, then retired with full honors to his plantations at [[Ennery, Artibonite|Ennery]].<ref>Bell, pp.261\u2013262</ref>\n\n===Arrest and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ann Whitney, Toussaint Louverture, plaster, 1870.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Toussaint L'Ouverture'', 1870]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] was at least partially responsible for Louverture's arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture's son Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote to Leclerc to denounce Louverture's conduct as \"extraordinary.\" For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Girard|first1=Philippe R.|title=Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2012|volume=69|issue=3|page=559|url=http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|ref=Girard2012 |publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|quote=a list of \u201cextraordinary expenses incurred by General Brunet in regards to [the arrest of] Toussaint\u201d started with \u201cgifts in wine and liquor, gifts to Dessalines and his spouse, money to his officers: 4000 francs.\u201d|doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.69.3.0549|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125421/http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLeclerc originally asked Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]] was ordered to do so, but accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One version said that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in [[Saint-Domingue]] and was asking Louverture's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs, however, suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him. Either way, Louverture had a letter, in which Brunet described himself as a \"sincere friend\", to take with him to France. Embarrassed about his trickery, Brunet absented himself during the arrest.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1 = Girard\n| first1 = Philippe R.\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title = The Slaves who Defeated Napol\u00e9on: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence, 1801\u20131804 | publisher = University of Alabama Press\n| place =\n| volume =\n| edition =\n| year = 2011\n}}</ref> Brunet deported Louverture and his aides to France on the frigate [[French frigate Cr\u00e9ole (1797)|''Cr\u00e9ole'']] and the 74-gun [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1801)|''H\u00e9ros'']], claiming that he suspected the former leader of plotting an uprising.

During the 19th century African Americans referred to Louverture as an example of how to reach freedom.

However, his achievements set the grounds for the black army's absolute victory and for [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] to declare the sovereign state of [[Haiti]] in January 1804.

He gradually established control over the whole island and used political and military tactics to gain dominance over his rivals. Throughout his years in power, he worked to improve the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labour, negotiated trade treaties with the United Kingdom and the United States, and maintained a large and well-disciplined army.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.7-8\">Cauna, pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nAfter defeating leaders among the [[free people of color]], in 1801, he promulgated an autonomist constitution for the colony, which named him as [[President for Life|Governor-General for Life]]. In 1802 he was invited to a parley by a French general, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, under false pretenses and arrested. He was deported to France and jailed, dying of pneumonia in 1803. Suffering massive losses in multiple historic battles at the hands of the Haitian army and losing many men of their forces to [[yellow fever]], the French capitulated and withdrew permanently from Saint-Domingue that very year. The Haitian Revolution continued under Louverture's lieutenant, Dessalines, who declared independence on 1 January 1804.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|General Toussaint Louverture, pictured here on a Haitian banknote]]\nFor years little was known for certain about Toussaint Louverture's early life, as there were contradictory accounts and evidence about his life before the advent of the Haitian Revolution. The earliest records of his life are his recorded remarks and the reminiscences of his second legitimate son, Isaac Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.57\u201358</ref> Toussaint Louverture's parents are not known. John Beard's biography of Louverture claims that family traditions name his grandfather as [[Gaou Guinou]], a son of the [[Great Ardra|King of Allada]]. Louverture was the eldest of several children.<ref>Beard, pp.23\u201324</ref> Pierre Baptiste Simon is usually considered to have been his godfather.<ref>Korngold, page number needed.</ref>\n\nLouverture is thought to have been born on the plantation of Br\u00e9da at Haut de Cap in [[Saint-Domingue]], which was owned by the Comte de No\u00e9 and later managed by Bayon de Libertate.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360, 62</ref> His date of birth is uncertain, but his name suggests he was born on [[All Saints Day]], 1 November. He was probably about 50 at the start of the revolution in 1791.<ref>Bell, p.60</ref> Various sources have given birth dates between 1739 and 1746. Because of the lack of written records, Louverture may not have known his exact birth date.<ref>Bell, pp.59\u201360.</ref> In childhood, he earned the nickname ''Fatras-B\u00e2ton,'' suggesting he was small and weak, though he was to become known for his stamina and riding prowess.<ref>Beard, pp.26\u201327; Bell, p.60, 62</ref> An alternative explanation of Louverture's origins is that he was brought to Br\u00e9da by the new overseer Bayon de Libertate, who took up his duties in 1772.<ref>Bell, pp.66, 70, 72</ref>\n\n===Education===\nLouverture is believed to have been well educated by his godfather Pierre Baptiste, a [[free person of color]] who lived and worked on the Br\u00e9da plantation. Historians have speculated as to Louverture's intellectual background. His extant letters demonstrate a command of French in addition to [[Haitian Creole|Creole]]; and he reveals familiarity with [[Epictetus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] who had lived as a slave. His public speeches as well as his life's work, according to his biographers, show a familiarity with [[Machiavelli]].<ref name=\"Bell, p.61\">Bell, p.61</ref> Some cite [[Abb\u00e9 Raynal]], who wrote against slavery, as a possible influence:<ref>Bell, p.61; Beard, pp.30\u201336</ref> The wording of the proclamation issued by then rebel slave leader Louverture on 29 August 1793, which may have been the first time he publicly used the name \"Louverture\", seems to refer to an anti-slavery passage in Abb\u00e9 Raynal's \"A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies.\"<ref>Bell, p.18</ref><ref>Robin Blackburn. ''The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery 1776\u20131848''. New York: Verso, 2000, p.54.</ref>\n\nHe may also have received some education from [[Jesuit]] missionaries. His medical knowledge is attributed to familiarity with African or Creole herbal-medical techniques, as well techniques commonly found in Jesuit-administered hospitals.<ref>Bell, pp. 64\u201365</ref> A few legal documents signed on Louverture's behalf between 1778 and 1781 suggest that he could not write at that time.<ref>Cauna, pp.61\u201367; Bell, pp.60, 80</ref> Throughout his military and political career, he used secretaries to prepare most of his correspondence. A few surviving documents in his own hand confirm that he could write, although his spelling in the French language was \"strictly phonetic.\"<ref>Bell, p.61; James, p.104</ref> That is not to suggest, however, that Louverture did not have a complex understanding of diplomacy; even lacking formal education, his correspondence with France during the Haitian Revolution beyond proved a high level of intellectual competence.<ref>Dr. Brenda Elsey, personal communication, March, 2020.</ref> At the expense of many potential intellectuals, the rapacious slave trade system often prevented many from seeing their in-built aptitudes come to full fruition; \"Although the African Black populations were typically illiterate, this does not mean they were unintelligent. Rather, they had been educated in skills, crafts, and traditions which were often lost during centuries of slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Ralph|date=1997-12-22|title=The Laws of Ignorance Designed to Keep Slaves (Blacks) Illiterate and Powerless|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-20479492/the-laws-of-ignorance-designed-to-keep-slaves-blacks|journal=Education|volume=118|issue=2|pages=206|issn=0013-1172}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage and children===\n[[File:19th century engraving of L'Ouverture.JPG|thumb|upright|19th century engraving of Louverture]]\nIn 1782, Louverture married [[Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture|Suzanne Simone Baptiste]], who is thought to have been his cousin or the daughter of his godfather.<ref>Cauna, p.263</ref> Toward the end of his life, he told General [[Marie-Fran\u00e7ois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga|Caffarelli]] that he had fathered 16 children with multiple women, of whom 11 had predeceased him.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\">Cauna, pp.264\u2013267</ref> Not all his children can be identified for certain, but his three legitimate sons are well known.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/> The eldest, Placide, was probably adopted by Louverture and is generally thought to have been Suzanne's first child, fathered by Seraphim Le Clerc, a mulatto.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/> The two sons born of his marriage with Suzanne were Isaac and Saint-Jean.<ref name=\"Cauna, pp.264-267\"/>\n\n=== Slavery, freedom and working life ===\n<blockquote>\"I was born a slave, but nature gave me the soul of a free man.\"<ref>Parkinson, p.37</ref></blockquote>\n\nUntil 1938, historians believed that Louverture had been a slave until the start of the revolution.<ref>Up to, for example, [[C.L.R. James]], writing in 1938</ref> In the later 20th century, discovery of a marriage certificate dated 1777 documents that he was freed in 1776 at the age of 33. This find retrospectively clarified a letter of 1797, in which he said he had been free for twenty years.<ref>Cauna, pp. 62\u201362</ref> He appeared to have an important role on the Br\u00e9da plantation until the outbreak of the revolution, presumably as a salaried employee who contributed to the daily functions of the plantation.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\">Bell, pp. 24\u201325</ref> He had initially been responsible for the [[livestock]].<ref>Bell, p.62</ref> By 1791, his responsibilities most likely included acting as coachman to the overseer, de Libertat, and as a slave-driver, charged with organising the work force.<ref>Bell, p.76,</ref>\n\nAs a free man, Louverture began to accumulate wealth and property. Surviving legal documents show him renting a small coffee plantation that was worked by a dozen of his own slaves.<ref>Cauna, pp.63\u201365</ref> He would later say that by the start of the revolution, he had acquired a reasonable fortune, and was the owner of a number of properties and slaves at Ennery.<ref>Bell, pp.72\u201373</ref>\n\nLouverture's life philosophy, as a revolutionary spirit, not only incited widespread recognition of autonomy among his enslaved counterparts but evoked a collective sense of worry among colonialist nations, such as Great Britain, which feared the slave revolt and ideology would spread to other slave societies in the Caribbean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Meade|first=Teresa|title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=9781118772485|location=John Wiley & Sons Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, UK|pages=68}}</ref> In light of the given circumstance, \"England found the French army preferable to the enlightened to Toussaint Louverture, while the United States, only just free of its own colonial oppression, opted to ally with the colonial powers of England and France rather than to give aid to Saint-Dominques's anti-colonial struggle.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\nThroughout his life, Louverture was known as a devout [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>Bell, p.194</ref> After defeating forces led by [[Andre Rigaud]] in the [[War of the Knives]], Louverture consolidated his power by decreeing a new constitution for the colony in 1801. It established Catholicism as the official religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/haiti/1801/constitution.htm |accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref> Although [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] was generally practiced on Saint-Domingue in combination with Catholicism, little is known for certain if Louverture had any connection with it. Officially as ruler of Saint-Domingue, he discouraged it.<ref>Bell, pp.56, 196</ref>\n\nHistorians have suggested that he was a member of high degree of the [[Masonic Lodge]] of Saint-Domingue, mostly based on a Masonic symbol he used in his signature. The membership of several free blacks and white men close to him has been confirmed.<ref>Bell, p.63</ref> His membership is, considering his status as a devout Catholic, nonetheless unlikely due to the papal ban on Catholics holding membership in Masonic organizations introduced by Pope Clement XII having gone into effect in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clement XII |first1=Pope |title=In Eminenti |url=https://www.papalencyclicals.net/clem12/c12inemengl.htm |website=papalenciclicals.net |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Haitian Revolution==\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791\u20131804) was a [[slave revolt]] in the [[French colonial empire|French colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]], which culminated in the elimination of [[slavery]] there and established the [[Republic of Haiti]]. It was the only slave revolt in the modern era that led to the founding of a [[Sovereign state|state]]. It is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred in the Americas.\n\n===The Rebellion: 1791\u20131794===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|right|Toussaint Louverture, as depicted in an 1802 French engraving]]\n\nBeginning in 1789, [[free people of color]] of Saint-Domingue were inspired by the [[French Revolution]] to seek an expansion of their rights and equality, while perpetuating the denial of freedom and rights to the slaves, who made up the overwhelming majority of population on the island. Initially, the slave population did not become involved in the conflict.<ref>Bell, pp.12\u201315; James, pp.81\u201382</ref> In August 1791, a Vodou ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] marked the start of a [[St. Domingue Slave Revolt|major slave rebellion]] in the north, which had the largest plantations and masses of slaves. Louverture apparently did not take part in the earliest stages of the rebellion, but after a few weeks he sent his family to safety in Spanish [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] and helped the overseers of the Breda plantation to leave the island. He joined the forces of [[Georges Biassou]] as doctor to the troops, commanding a small detachment.<ref>James, p.90; Bell, pp.23\u201324</ref> Surviving documents show him participating in the leadership of the rebellion, discussing strategy, and negotiating with the Spanish supporters of the rebellion for supplies.<ref name=\"Bell, pp.24-25\"/>\n\nIn December 1791, he was involved in negotiations between rebel leaders and the French Governor, [[Philibert Fran\u00e7ois Rouxel de Blanchelande|Blanchelande]], for the release of their white prisoners and a return to work in exchange for a ban on the use of the whip, an extra non-working day per week, and freedom for a handful of leaders.<ref>Bell, p.32-33</ref> When the offer was rejected, he was instrumental in preventing the massacre of Biassou's white prisoners.<ref>Bell, p.33</ref> The prisoners were released after further negotiations with the French commissioners and taken to [[Le Cap]] by Louverture. He hoped to use the occasion to present the rebellion's demands to the colonial assembly, but they refused to meet with him.<ref>Bell, pp.34\u201335</ref>\n\nThroughout 1792, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, Louverture ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the ''Cordon de l'Ouest,'' a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory.<ref>Bell, pp.42\u201350</ref> He gained a reputation for running an orderly camp, trained his men in [[guerrilla]] tactics and \"the European style of war\",<ref>Bell, pp.46</ref> and began to attract soldiers who would play an important role throughout the revolution.<ref>Bell, pp.28, 55</ref> After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General [[\u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux]], but it was in these battles that the French first recognised him as a significant military leader.<ref>Bell, p.50</ref>\n\nSome time in 1792\u201393, he adopted the surname Louverture, from the French word for \"opening\" or \"the one who opened the way\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Lester|title=The Americas in the Age of Revolution: 1750-1850|url=https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang|url-access=registration|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=[https://archive.org/details/americasinageofr00lang/page/111 111]}}</ref> Although some modern writers spell his adopted surname with an apostrophe, as in \"L'Ouverture\", he did not, as his extant correspondence indicates. The most common explanation is that it refers to his ability to create openings in battle. The name is sometimes attributed to French commissioner Polverel's exclamation: \"That man makes an opening everywhere\". However, some writers think the name referred to a gap between his front teeth.<ref>Bell, p.56</ref>\n\nDespite adhering to royalist political views, Louverture had begun to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution.<ref>James, pp.125\u2013126</ref> From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition.<ref>Bell, pp.86\u201387; James, p.107</ref> \n\nOn 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the blacks of St Domingue:\n<blockquote>Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.<br /><br />Your very humble and obedient servant, Toussaint Louverture,<br /><br />General of the armies of the king, for the public good.<ref>Bell, p.18</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture Signature.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Toussaint Louverture's signature]]\n\nOn the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]], proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue,<ref>Bell, p.19</ref> hoping to bring the black troops over to his side.<ref>James, pp.128\u2013130</ref> Initially, this failed, perhaps because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.<ref>James, p.137</ref> However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, pp.141\u2013142</ref> For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general \u00c9tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux. During this time, competition between him and other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavour on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.<ref>Bell, pp.92\u201395</ref> In May 1794, when the decision of the French government became known in Saint-Domingue, Louverture switched allegiance from the Spanish to the French and rallied his troops to Laveaux.<ref>James pp.143\u2013144</ref>\n\n===Alliance with the French: 1794\u20131796===\n{{Slavery}}\nAfter months of skillful maneuvering that kept him on nominally good terms with the Spanish, while he also had secret correspondence with the new revolutionary French colonial government, Louverture officially joined the French in early May 1794, raising the republican flag over the port of [[Gona\u00efves]]. This provoked an exodus of refugees, both whites and free people of color, with many taking slaves with them.  In the first weeks, Louverture eradicated all Spanish supporters from the Cordon de l'Ouest, which he had held on their behalf.<ref>Bell, pp.104\u2013108</ref> \n\nHe faced attack from multiple sides. His former colleagues in the black slave rebellion were now fighting against him for the Spanish. As a French commander, he was under attack from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops who had landed on Saint-Domingue in September, as the British hoped to take advantage of the instability and gain control of the wealthy sugar-producing island.<ref>Bell, p.109</ref> On the other hand, he was able to pool his 4,000 men with Laveaux's troops in joint actions.<ref>James, p.143</ref> By now his officers included men who were to remain important throughout the revolution: his brother Paul, his nephew [[Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse|Mo\u00efse]], [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], and [[Henri Christophe]].<ref>James, p.147</ref>\n\nBefore long, Louverture had put an end to the Spanish threat to French Saint-Domingue. In any case, the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] of July 1795 marked a formal end to hostilities between the two countries. Black leaders [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Papillon|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois]] and [[Biassou]] continued to fight against Louverture until November, when they left for Spain and Florida, respectively. At that point, most of their men joined Louverture's forces.<ref>Bell, p.115</ref> Louverture also made inroads against the British troops, but was unable to oust them from [[Saint-Marc]]. He contained them and rendered them ineffective by returning to guerilla tactics.<ref>Bell, pp.110\u2013114</ref>\n\nThroughout 1795 and 1796, Louverture was also concerned with re-establishing agriculture and exports, and keeping the peace in areas under his control. In speeches and policy he revealed his belief that the long-term freedom of the people of Saint-Domingue depended on the economic viability of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.113, 126</ref> He was held in general respect, and resorted to a mixture of diplomacy and force to return the field hands to the plantations as emancipated and paid workers.<ref>James, pp.155\u2013156</ref> Workers regularly created small rebellions, protesting poor conditions, their lack of real freedom, or fearing a return to slavery. They wanted to establish their own small holdings and work for themselves, rather than on plantations.<ref>James, pp.152\u2013154</ref>\n\nAnother of Louverture's concerns was to manage potential rivals for power within the French part of the colony. The most serious of these was the [[mulatto]] commander [[Jean-Louis Villatte]], based in [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]]. Louverture and Villate had competed over the command of some sections of troops and territory since 1794. Villatte was thought to be somewhat racist towards black soldiers such as Louverture and planned to ally with [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of colour, after overthrowing French General \u00c9tienne Laveaux.<ref>Laurent Dubois and John Garrigus, ''Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, 1789\u20131804: A Brief History with Documents''. Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, p.31</ref> In 1796 Villate drummed up popular support by accusing the French authorities of plotting a return to slavery. \n\nOn 20 March, he succeeded in capturing the French Governor Laveaux, and appointed himself Governor. Louverture's troops soon arrived at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to rescue the captured governor and drive Villatte out of town. Louverture was noted for opening the warehouses to the public, proving that they were empty of the chains that residents feared had been imported to prepare for a return to slavery. He was promoted to commander of the West Province two months later, and in 1797 was appointed as Saint-Domingue's top-ranking officer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\">Dubois and Garrigus, p.31</ref> Laveaux proclaimed Louverture as Lieutenant Governor, announcing at the same time that he would do nothing without his approval, to which Louverture replied, \"After God, Laveaux\".<ref>Bell, pp.132\u2013134; James, pp.163\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Third Commission: 1796\u201397===\nA few weeks after Louverture's triumph over the Villate insurrection, France's representatives of the third commission arrived in Saint-Domingue. Among them was [[Sonthonax]], the commissioner who had previously declared abolition of slavery on the same day as Louverture's proclamation of Camp Turel.<ref>Bell, p.136</ref> At first the relationship between the two men was positive. Sonthonax promoted Louverture to general and arranged for his sons, Placide and Isaac, to attend the school that had been established in France for the children of colonials.<ref>Bell, pp.137, 140\u2013141</ref>\n\nIn September 1796, elections were held to choose colonial representatives for the French national assembly. Louverture's letters show that he encouraged Laveaux to stand, and historians have speculated as to whether he was seeking to place a firm supporter in France or to remove a rival in power.<ref>Bell, pp.147\u2013148</ref> Sonthonax was also elected, either at Louverture's instigation or on his own initiative. While Laveaux left Saint-Domingue in October, Sonthonax remained.<ref>Bell, p.145, James, p.180</ref>\n\nSonthonax, a fervent revolutionary and fierce supporter of racial equality, soon rivalled Louverture in popularity. Although their goals were similar, they had several points of conflict.<ref>James, pp.174\u2013176; Bell, pp. 141\u2013142, 147</ref> They strongly disagreed about accepting the return of the white planters who had fled Saint-Domingue at the start of the revolution. To Sonthonax, they were potential counter-revolutionaries, to be assimilated, officially or not, with the \u2018[[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]\u2019 who had fled the French Revolution and were forbidden to return under pain of death. To Louverture, they were bearers of useful skills and knowledge, and he wanted them back.<ref>Bell, pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nIn summer 1797, Louverture authorised the return of Bayon de Libertat, the ex-overseer of Br\u00e9da, with whom he had a lifelong relationship. Sonthonax wrote to Louverture threatening him with prosecution and ordering him to get Bayon off the island. Louverture went over his head and wrote to the French [[Directoire]] directly for permission for Bayon to stay.<ref>Bell, p.150</ref> Only a few weeks later, he began arranging for Sonthonax's return to France that summer.<ref name=\"Dubois and Garrigus, p.31\"/> Louverture had several reasons to want to get rid of Sonthonax; officially he said that Sonthonax had tried to involve him in a plot to make Saint-Domingue independent, starting with a massacre of the whites of the island.<ref>Bell, pp.150\u2013153</ref> The accusation played on Sonthonax's political radicalism and known hatred of the aristocratic white planters, but historians have varied as to how credible they consider it.<ref>James, pp.190, Bell, pp.153\u2013154</ref>\n\nOn reaching France, Sonthonax countered by accusing Louverture of royalist, counter-revolutionary, and pro-independence tendencies.<ref>Bell, p.153</ref> Louverture knew that he had asserted his authority to such an extent that the French government might well suspect him of seeking independence.<ref>Bell, pp.153, 155</ref> At the same time, the French Directoire government was considerably less revolutionary than it had been. Suspicions began to brew that it might reconsider the abolition of slavery.<ref>James, p.179</ref> In November 1797, Louverture wrote again to the Directoire, assuring them of his loyalty but reminding them firmly that abolition must be maintained.<ref>Bell, p.155</ref>\n\n===Treaties with Britain and the United States: 1798===\n[[File:Maitland and Louverture.jpg|thumb|right|''General [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] meets Louverture to discuss the secret treaty'']]\nFor several months, Louverture was in sole command of French Saint-Domingue, except for a semi-autonomous state in the south, where  general [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]], a free man of color, had rejected the authority of the third commission.<ref>Bell, pp.142\u2013143</ref> Both generals continued attacking the British, whose position on Saint-Domingue was looking increasingly weak.<ref>James, p.201</ref> Louverture was negotiating their withdrawal when France's latest commissioner, [[Comte d'H\u00e9douville|Gabriel H\u00e9douville]], arrived in March 1798, with orders to undermine his authority.<ref>James, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nOn 30 April 1798, Louverture signed a treaty with the British general, [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], exchanging the withdrawal of British troops from western Saint-Domingue for an amnesty for the French counter-revolutionaries in those areas. In May, [[Port-au-Prince]] was returned to French rule in an atmosphere of order and celebration.<ref>James, pp.202, 204</ref>\n\nIn July, Louverture and Rigaud met commissioner H\u00e9douville together. Hoping to create a rivalry that would diminish Louverture's power, H\u00e9douville displayed a strong preference for Rigaud, and an aversion to Louverture.<ref>James, pp.207\u2013208</ref> However, General Maitland was also playing on French rivalries and evaded H\u00e9douville's authority to deal with Louverture directly.<ref>James, pp.211\u2013212</ref> In August, Louverture and Maitland signed treaties for the evacuation of the remaining British troops. On 31 August, they signed a secret treaty which lifted the British blockade on Saint-Domingue in exchange for a promise that Louverture would not export the black revolution to the British colony of [[Jamaica]], which also used slaves to produce sugar.<ref>Bell, pp.159\u2013160</ref>\n\nAs Louverture's relationship with H\u00e9douville reached the breaking point, an uprising began among the troops of his adopted nephew, Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse. Attempts by H\u00e9douville to manage the situation made matters worse and Louverture declined to help him. As the rebellion grew to a full-scale insurrection, H\u00e9douville prepared to leave the island, while Louverture and Dessalines threatened to arrest him as a troublemaker.<ref>James, pp.219\u2013220</ref> H\u00e9douville sailed for France in October 1798, nominally transferring his authority to Rigaud. Louverture decided instead to work with Phillipe Roume, a member of the third commission who had been posted to the Spanish parts of the colony.<ref>Bell, pp.165\u2013166</ref> Though Louverture continued to protest his loyalty to the French government, he had expelled a second government representative from the territory and was about to negotiate another autonomous agreement with one of France's enemies.<ref>Bell, pp.166\u2013167</ref>\n\nThe United States had suspended trade with France in 1798 because of increasing conflict over piracy. The two countries were almost at war, but trade between Saint-Domingue and the United States was desirable to both Louverture and the United States. With H\u00e9douville gone, Louverture sent [[Joseph Bunel]] to negotiate with the government of [[John Adams]]. The terms of the treaty were similar to those already established with the British, but Louverture continually resisted suggestions from either power that he should declare independence.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Black Talleyrand: Toussaint L'Ouverture's Secret Diplomacy with England and the United States\", ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 66:1 (Jan. 2009), 87\u2013124.</ref> As long as France maintained the abolition of slavery, he appeared to be content to have the colony remain French, at least in name.<ref>Bell, pp.173\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Expansion of territory: 1799\u20131801===\n\nIn 1799, the tensions between Louverture and [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]] came to a head. Louverture accused Rigaud of trying to assassinate him to gain power over Saint-Domingue for himself. Rigaud claimed Louverture was conspiring with the British to restore slavery.<ref>Bell, pp.174\u2013175</ref> The conflict was complicated by racial overtones which escalated tension between blacks and mulattoes.<ref>Bell, pp.175\u2013177, 178\u2013179; James, pp.229\u2013230</ref> Louverture had other political reasons for bringing down Rigaud. Only by controlling every port could he hope to prevent a landing of French troops if necessary.<ref>James, pp.224, 237</ref>\n\nAfter Rigaud sent troops to seize the border towns of [[Petit-Goave]] and [[Grand-Goave]] in June 1799, Louverture persuaded Roume to declare Rigaud a traitor and attacked the southern state.<ref>Bell, p.177</ref> The resulting civil war, known as the [[War of Knives]], lasted over a year, with the defeated Rigaud fleeing to [[Guadeloupe]], then France, in August 1800.<ref>Bell, pp.182\u2013185</ref> Louverture delegated most of the campaign to his lieutenant, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who became infamous, during and after the war, for massacring mulatto captives and civilians.<ref>Bell, pp.179\u2013180</ref> The number of deaths is contested: the contemporary French general Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Pamphile de Lacroix suggested 10,000 deaths, while the 20th-century [[Trinidad|Trinidadian]] historian [[C.L.R. James]] later claimed there were only a few hundred deaths in contravention of the amnesty.<ref>James, p.236-237</ref>\n\nIn November 1799, during the civil war, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France and passed a new constitution declaring that the colonies would be subject to special laws.<ref>Bell, p.180</ref> Although the colonies suspected this meant the re-introduction of slavery, Napoleon began by confirming Louverture's position and promising to maintain abolition.<ref>Bell, p.184</ref> But he also forbade Louverture to invade Spanish Santo Domingo, an action that would put Louverture in a powerful defensive position.<ref>Bell, p.186</ref> Louverture was determined to proceed anyway and coerced Roume into supplying the necessary permission.<ref>Bell, pp.180\u2013182, 187</ref> \n\nIn January 1801, Louverture and Hyacinthe Mo\u00efse invaded the Spanish territory, taking possession from the Governor, Don Garcia, with few difficulties. The area had been less developed and less densely populated than the French section. Louverture brought it under French law, which abolished slavery, and embarked on a program of modernization. He was now master of the whole island.<ref>Bell, pp.189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Constitution of 1801===\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture engraving.jpg|thumb|An early engraving of Louverture]]\nNapoleon had informed the inhabitants of Saint-Domingue that France would draw up a new constitution for its colonies, in which they would be subjected to special laws.<ref>Alexis, Stephen. ''Black Liberator.'' London: Ernest Benn Limited, 1949, p.165</ref> Despite his initial protestations to the contrary, the former slaves feared that he might restore slavery. In March 1801, Louverture appointed a constitutional assembly, composed chiefly of white planters, to draft a constitution for Saint-Domingue. He promulgated the Constitution on 7 July 1801, officially establishing his authority over the ''entire'' island of [[Hispaniola]]. It made him Governor-General for Life with near absolute powers and the possibility of choosing his successor. However, Louverture was not to explicitly declare Saint-Domingue's independence, acknowledging in Article 1 that it was a single colony of the French Empire.<ref>\"Constitution de la colonie fran\u00e7ais de Saint-Domingue\", Le Cap, 1801</ref>\nArticle 3 of the constitution states: \"There cannot exist slaves [in Saint-Domingue], servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.140</ref> The constitution guaranteed equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law for all races, but also confirmed Louverture's policies of forced labour and the importation of workers through the slave trade.<ref>Bell, pp.210\u2013211</ref> Louverture was not willing to compromise [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] for Vodou, the dominant faith among former slaves. Article 6 states that \"the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman faith shall be the only publicly professed faith.\"<ref>Og\u00e9, Jean-Louis. ''Toussaint L'Ouverture et l'Ind\u00e9pendence d'Ha\u00efti.'' Brossard: L\u2019\u00c9diteur de Vos R\u00eaves, 2002, p.141</ref>\n\nLouverture charged Colonel [[Charles Humbert Marie Vincent|Vincent]] with the task of presenting the new constitution to Napoleon, although Vincent was horrified to learn that the general had gone so far. Several aspects of the constitution were damaging to France: the absence of provision for French government officials, the lack of advantages to France in trade with its own colony, and Louverture's breach of protocol in publishing the constitution before submitting it to the French government. Despite his disapproval, Vincent attempted to submit the constitution to Napoleon in a positive light, but was briefly exiled to Elba for his pains.<ref>Philippe Girard, ''The Slaves Who Defeated Napol\u00e9on: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Haitian War of Independence'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, November 2011).</ref>\n\nLouverture identified as a Frenchman and strove to convince Bonaparte of his loyalty. He wrote to Napoleon but received no reply.<ref>James, p.263</ref> Napoleon eventually decided to send an expedition of 20,000 men to Saint-Domingue to restore French authority, and possibly to restore slavery as well.<ref>Philippe Girard, \"Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and the Emancipation Issue in Saint-Domingue, 1799\u20131803,\" ''French Historical Studies'' 32:4 (Fall 2009), 587\u2013618.</ref> Given the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (March 1802-May 1803) with Great Britain, Napoleon was suddenly able to plan this operation without the risk of interception by the [[Royal Navy]].\n\n===Leclerc's campaign===\n\nNapoleon's troops, under the command of his brother-in-law, General [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Emmanuel Leclerc]], were directed to seize control of the island by diplomatic means, proclaiming peaceful intentions, and keep secret his orders to deport all black officers.<ref>James, pp.292\u2013294, Bell, pp.223\u2013224</ref> Meanwhile, Louverture was preparing for defence and ensuring discipline. This may have contributed to a rebellion against forced labor led by his nephew and top general, Mo\u00efse, in October 1801. Because the activism was violently repressed, when the French ships arrived, not all of Saint-Domingue was automatically on Louverture's side.<ref>Bell, pp.206\u2013209, 226\u2013229, 250</ref> In late January 1802, while Leclerc sought permission to land at [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] and Christophe held him off, the Vicomte de [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] suddenly attacked [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]], effectively quashing the diplomatic option.<ref>Bell, pp.232\u2013234</ref>\n\nLouverture's plan in case of war was to burn the coastal cities and as much of the plains as possible, retreat with his troops into the inaccessible mountains, and wait for [[yellow fever]], which flourished on a seasonal basis, to decimate the European troops.<ref>Bell, pp.234\u2013236</ref> The biggest impediment to this plan proved to be difficulty in internal communications. Christophe burned Cap-Fran\u00e7ais and retreated, but Paul Louverture was tricked by a false letter into allowing the French to occupy Santo Domingo; other officers believed Napoleon's diplomatic proclamation, while some attempted resistance instead of burning and retreating.<ref>Bell, pp.234, 236\u2013237</ref> French reports to Napoleon show that in the months of fighting that followed, the French felt their position was weak, but that Louverture and his generals did not fully realize their strength.<ref>Bell, p.256-260</ref>\n\nWith both sides shocked by the violence of the initial fighting, Leclerc tried belatedly to revert to the diplomatic solution. Louverture's sons and their tutor had been sent from France to accompany the expedition with this end in mind and were now sent to present Napoleon's proclamation to Louverture.<ref>Bell, pp.237\u2013241</ref> When these talks broke down, months of inconclusive fighting followed. On 6 May 1802, Louverture rode into Cap-Fran\u00e7ais to treat with Leclerc. He negotiated an amnesty for all his remaining generals, then retired with full honors to his plantations at [[Ennery, Artibonite|Ennery]].<ref>Bell, pp.261\u2013262</ref>\n\n===Arrest and imprisonment===\n[[File:Ann Whitney, Toussaint Louverture, plaster, 1870.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Toussaint L'Ouverture'', 1870]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] was at least partially responsible for Louverture's arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture's son Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote to Leclerc to denounce Louverture's conduct as \"extraordinary.\" For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Girard|first1=Philippe R.|title=Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2012|volume=69|issue=3|page=559|url=http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|ref=Girard2012 |publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|quote=a list of \u201cextraordinary expenses incurred by General Brunet in regards to [the arrest of] Toussaint\u201d started with \u201cgifts in wine and liquor, gifts to Dessalines and his spouse, money to his officers: 4000 francs.\u201d|doi=10.5309/willmaryquar.69.3.0549|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125421/http://www.niu.edu/history/programs/awdg/jean_jacques_dessalines_and_the_atlantic_system_a_reappraisal.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLeclerc originally asked Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. [[Jean Baptiste Brunet]] was ordered to do so, but accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One version said that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in [[Saint-Domingue]] and was asking Louverture's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs, however, suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him.

There were also many undercover agents looking for the secrets brought by the Portuguese voyages to remote lands. Among them was Alberto Cantino, who was sent to Portugal by [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], with the formal intention of [[horse trading]], while secretly collecting information on [[History of Portugal (1415\u20131578)|Portuguese Discoveries]]. Cantino's diligence is shown in one of his five remaining letters to the Duke, dated 17 October 1501, where he describes, amongst other things, hearing Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] detailing his latest voyage to [[Newfoundland]] (Terra Nova) to [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]].\n\nA popular theory, introduced in the earliest studies of the map,<ref>Duarte Leite (1923), 225-32</ref> suggests that the Cantino Planisphere was ordered to an official Portuguese mapmaker, who made a copy of the royal cartographic pattern, the so-called ''Padr\u00e3o Real'', kept in the ''Armaz\u00e9ns da \u00cdndia''. However, there is no historical evidence that such order was ever made and the theory is weakened by the presence of numerous mistakes. One would expect a carefully made copy of an official standard, if it existed in Portugal at that time, would be accurate.<ref>Gaspar (2012), 181-82</ref> A more plausible explanation is that the map was surreptitiously acquired shortly after it was made for some nobleman or official client.<ref>Gaspar (2010), 182; 195</ref> From a letter sent by Cantino to his patron, the Duke of Ferrara, on 19 November 1502, we know that he paid 12 golden [[ducat]]s for it, which was a considerable amount for the time. An Italian inscription in the back of the map reads: ''Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam trovate in le parte de India: dono Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole'', which translates as 'Navigational chart of the islands recently [discovered]... in part of the Indies: from Alberto Cantino to Duke Hercole'.\n\nWhile it enlightened the Italians to many new territories yet unknown to them, it was obsolete within months due to subsequent mapping voyages by the Portuguese. Nevertheless, its importance to the Portuguese\u2013Italian trade relations should not be understated; this map provided the Italians with knowledge of Brazil's coastline and that of much of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] Coast of [[South America]] long before other nations even knew South America extended so far to the south. It also supplied great details of the [[Indian Ocean]]. A peninsula to the northeast of Cuba has been identified by some others as [[Florida]] while others argue that it was actually intended to represent part of [[China]], [[Cuba]] itself, or the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://journals.fcla.edu/flgeog/article/view/77942/75378 | title=THE FIRST EUROPEAN CHARTING OF FLORIDA AND THE ADJACENT SHORES | author=Peck, Douglas T. | journal=The Florida Geographer | year=2003 | volume=34 | pages=82\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe geographical information given on the Cantino map was copied into the Italian-made [[Caverio map|Canerio (or Caveri) map]] shortly after the Cantino map arrived in Italy and the Canerio, in turn, became the primary source for the design of the newly discovered western lands on the highly influential wall map of the world produced by [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] in 1507 under the auspices of Rene, Duke of Lorraine.\n\nThis old map, made-up by 6 glued [[parchment]] sheets, was kept in the Ducal Library, [[Ferrara]], for about 90 years, until [[Pope Clement VIII]] transferred it to another palace in [[Modena]], Italy. More than two centuries later, in 1859, the palace was ransacked and the Cantino Map lost. It was found by Giuseppe Boni, Director of the Biblioteca Estense, in that same year, in a butcher's store in Modena. The Cantino world map can currently be found in [[Modena]], Italy, at the [[Biblioteca Estense]].\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:Cantino rhumb line system.JPG|thumb|300px|The rhumb-line construction scheme and geographic lines in the Cantino planisphere. Adapted from Gaspar (2012), Plate 3]]\nThe Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant example of the so-called ''latitude chart'', which was developed following the introduction of astronomical navigation, during the second half of the fifteenth century. Contrarily to the portolan charts of the Mediterranean, which were constructed on the basis of magnetic courses and estimated distances between places, in the latitude chart places were represented according to their latitudes. In the Cantino planisphere, latitudes were incorporated only in the coasts of Africa, Brazil and India, while Europe and the Caribbean Sea continued to be represented according to the portolan-chart model <ref>Gaspar (2012), 129-82</ref>).\n\nThe construction of the [[rhumb lines|rhumb line]] system in the Cantino planisphere uses two circles (some charts use only one, others use as many as three, depending of size): the western circle is centered on the [[Cape Verde|Cape Vert]] Islands, the eastern circle is centered in India. The circumference of each circle is marked with sixteen equally spaced points, from which radiate the 32 classic rhumbs: 0\u00b0, 11 1/4\u00b0, 22 1/2\u00b0, 33 3/4\u00b0, etc. The western and eastern outer circles are tangent to each other at a large wind-rose in central Africa, with a [[fleur-de-lis]] indicating North. This dense rhumb-line mesh was used in navigation as a reference, for reading and marking directions (courses) between places. Six scale bars graduated in Iberian leagues, with a variable number of sections (or ''logs''), are distributed over the chart's area. These were used to measure distances between places.\n\nIllustrations are few, but elaborate. Two cities are grandly depicted - [[Venice]] and [[Jerusalem]]. There is also an elaborate depiction of the Portuguese castle of S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina ([[Elmina Castle]], on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] of [[west Africa]]), flanked by two African towns. Other illustrations include a lion-shaped mountain representing the [[Sierra Leone]] mountain range, the [[Pharos of Alexandria|Alexandria lighthouse]] (laid horizontal), the mythical [[Mountains of the Moon (Africa)|Mountains of the Moon]] (legendary source of the [[Nile River]]) in central Africa, and either the [[Table Mountain]] or [[Drakensberg]] range in South Africa. Along the central African coast are the various cross stone markers (''[[Padr\u00e3o|padr\u00f5es]]'') erected by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in the 1480s.\n\nIn north Africa, there is the \"Montes Claros\" in the usual place of the [[Atlas mountains]], the legend below on the left reading that \"this is the land of King Organo, whose king is very noble and very rich\", and to the right that this is the \"land of the King of Nubia, the king of which is continuously making war on [[Prester John]] and is a moor and a great enemy of Christians\".\n\n== Discoveries ==\nThe Brazilian coast was certainly the last to be added and reached its present form in three phases: to the first belong an initial coastline running to southeast from ''Golfo fremosso'' to ''Cabo Sam Jorge'', and from there, to north of ''Porto Seguro'', continuing further south to the tip of the landmass. Only a relatively small portion of the coast, between the flag near the ''Vera cruz'' inscription and the northern side of the ''baia de todos os santos'' would have been surveyed, in 1500, by the fleet of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral. To the second phase belongs the pasting of the strip of parchment between ''Rio de s\u00e3 franc\u00b0'' and ''Golfo fremosso'', which would have been based on the information brought by the fleet of Jo\u00e3o da Nova, who arrived in Lisbon in September 1502. In the third phase the island named ''quaresma'', together with some names written in cursive would have been added .<ref>Roukema (1963), p. 7-8</ref>\n\nThe European rediscovery of [[Greenland]] is thought to have been by Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Labrador and Pedro de Barcelos between 1495 and 1498, and also visited by [[Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot), in the English expedition of 1498. But the depiction of the island on the map suggests it was based on the Portuguese mission of Labrador and Barcelos. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was probably visited by an English expedition in 1497\u201398, and again, by the Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] in 1500 and 1501. The map makes clear that the land was discovered and charted for Portugal by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], for King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\n== North America ==\n[[File:Cantino Map - North America.jpg|thumb|200px|Fragment of 1502 Cantino map, showing Cuba and land to its northwest.]]\n[[File:Cantino Map - 1502 - Florida.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of what might be Florida from the 1502 Cantino map]]\n[[Newfoundland]], which was visited in 1500 and 1501 by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] and his brother Miguel, members of the Portuguese royal household, is labeled as ''Terra del Rey de Portuguall'' on the Cantino map.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/coast.html | title=Portuguese Exploration along the Northeast Coast of North America}}</ref>\n\nAccording to certain authors, a stretch of mainland North American coastline is represented on the Cantino map. If the peninsula drawn northwest of Cuba represented the coasts of [[Florida]], it would mean it had been discovered 11 years before [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] got credit for discovering it in 1513. However, other authors dismiss that theory and identify that peninsula with the mainland of Asia, which [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] believed to have reached, or with the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=John Logan|title=A New World Disclosed|year=1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803210158|page=198}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Early world maps]]\n*[[Windrose network]]\n*[[Map of Juan de la Cosa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography and references==\n* Gaspar, Joaquim A.

Other illustrations include a lion-shaped mountain representing the [[Sierra Leone]] mountain range, the [[Pharos of Alexandria|Alexandria lighthouse]] (laid horizontal), the mythical [[Mountains of the Moon (Africa)|Mountains of the Moon]] (legendary source of the [[Nile River]]) in central Africa, and either the [[Table Mountain]] or [[Drakensberg]] range in South Africa. Along the central African coast are the various cross stone markers (''[[Padr\u00e3o|padr\u00f5es]]'') erected by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in the 1480s.\n\nIn north Africa, there is the \"Montes Claros\" in the usual place of the [[Atlas mountains]], the legend below on the left reading that \"this is the land of King Organo, whose king is very noble and very rich\", and to the right that this is the \"land of the King of Nubia, the king of which is continuously making war on [[Prester John]] and is a moor and a great enemy of Christians\".\n\n== Discoveries ==\nThe Brazilian coast was certainly the last to be added and reached its present form in three phases: to the first belong an initial coastline running to southeast from ''Golfo fremosso'' to ''Cabo Sam Jorge'', and from there, to north of ''Porto Seguro'', continuing further south to the tip of the landmass. Only a relatively small portion of the coast, between the flag near the ''Vera cruz'' inscription and the northern side of the ''baia de todos os santos'' would have been surveyed, in 1500, by the fleet of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral. To the second phase belongs the pasting of the strip of parchment between ''Rio de s\u00e3 franc\u00b0'' and ''Golfo fremosso'', which would have been based on the information brought by the fleet of Jo\u00e3o da Nova, who arrived in Lisbon in September 1502. In the third phase the island named ''quaresma'', together with some names written in cursive would have been added .<ref>Roukema (1963), p. 7-8</ref>\n\nThe European rediscovery of [[Greenland]] is thought to have been by Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Labrador and Pedro de Barcelos between 1495 and 1498, and also visited by [[Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot), in the English expedition of 1498. But the depiction of the island on the map suggests it was based on the Portuguese mission of Labrador and Barcelos. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was probably visited by an English expedition in 1497-98, and again, by the Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] in 1500 and 1501. The map makes clear that the land was discovered and charted for Portugal by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], for King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\n== North America ==\n[[File:Cantino Map - North America.jpg|thumb|200px|Fragment of 1502 Cantino map, showing Cuba and land to its northwest.]]\n[[File:Cantino Map - 1502 - Florida.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of what might be Florida from the 1502 Cantino map]]\n[[Newfoundland]], which was visited in 1500 and 1501 by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] and his brother Miguel, members of the Portuguese royal household, is labeled as ''Terra del Rey de Portuguall'' on the Cantino map.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/coast.html | title=Portuguese Exploration along the Northeast Coast of North America}}</ref>\n\nAccording to certain authors, a stretch of mainland North American coastline is represented on the Cantino map.

In 1953, Thomson acquired the ''[[The Scotsman|Scotsman]]'' newspaper and moved to Scotland the following year. He consolidated his media position in Scotland in 1957 when he won the [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]] for [[Scottish Television]]. In 1959, he bought the Kemsley Group, a purchase that eventually gave him control of the ''[[Sunday Times]]''. He separately acquired the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' in 1967. He moved into the airline business in 1965, when he acquired [[Britannia Airways]] and into oil and gas exploration in 1971 when he participated in a consortium to exploit reserves in the [[North Sea]]. In the 1970s, following the death of Thomson, the company withdrew from national newspapers and broadcast media, selling the ''Times'', the ''Sunday Times'' and Scottish Television and instead moved into publishing, buying [[Sweet & Maxwell]] in 1988. The company at this time was known as the International Thomson Organisation Ltd (ITOL).<ref name=\"History of The Thomson Corporation\">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-thomson-corporation-history/ The Thomson Corporation History].

In 1953, Thomson acquired the ''[[The Scotsman|Scotsman]]'' newspaper and moved to Scotland the following year. He consolidated his media position in Scotland in 1957 when he won the [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]] for [[Scottish Television]]. In 1959, he bought the Kemsley Group, a purchase that eventually gave him control of the ''[[Sunday Times]]''. He separately acquired the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' in 1967. He moved into the airline business in 1965, when he acquired [[Britannia Airways]] and into oil and gas exploration in 1971 when he participated in a consortium to exploit reserves in the [[North Sea]]. In the 1970s, following the death of Thomson, the company withdrew from national newspapers and broadcast media, selling the ''Times'', the ''Sunday Times'' and Scottish Television and instead moved into publishing, buying [[Sweet & Maxwell]] in 1988. The company at this time was known as the International Thomson Organisation Ltd (ITOL).<ref name=\"History of The Thomson Corporation\">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-thomson-corporation-history/ The Thomson Corporation History].
