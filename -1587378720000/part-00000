It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C. Hayavadana Rao]] wrote about Tipu in his encyclopaedic court history of Mysore. He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b.

During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.

Kirkpatrick ''Select Letters of Tipu Sultan'', London 1811</ref> and [[Mark Wilks]],<ref>M.

A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]].

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Inspired by French actresses, she played the roles of attractive young women, for example in the title roles of [[Fr\u00f8ken Nitouche]] and [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Dora''. She later took on roles where she sang, imitating the French singer [[Yvette Guilbert]]. This increased her popularity not only in [[Scandinavia]] but also in the United States where she performed for Danish audiences.

In 1871, she married the telegraphy executive Jens Petersen (1843\u201380) and in 1884, the actor Martinius Nielsen (1859-1928).<ref name=kvinfo/>\n\nNielsen's d\u00e9but was in May 1870 at the [[Casino Theatre (Copenhagen)|Casino Theatre]], [[Copenhagen]], when she acted anomynously in [[Erik Bogh]]'s Vaudeville play ''Et enfoldigt Pigebarn''. Despite her lack of any previous stage experience, she proved a great success, thanks to her natural grace and her good singing voice. After a few more roles at the Casino, in 1871 she married an executive from the [[GN Store Nord|Store Nordiske Telegrafselskab]] whom she accompanied to [[Paris]] where he was stationed until his death in 1880. Now familiar with the theatrical repertoire in Paris, she returned to the Casino in 1881, playing the title role in Victorien Sardou's ''Dora'', arousing comparisons with the French actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]].<ref name=kvinfo/>\n\nSuch was her success that she was also invited to act at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] but she actually preferred appearing at the Casino and later at the Dagmar Theatre. Here, in 1884, she was enormously successful in the operetta [[Fr\u00f8ken Nitouche]], appearing 500 times.

After a few more roles at the Casino, in 1871 she married an executive from the [[GN Store Nord|Store Nordiske Telegrafselskab]] whom she accompanied to [[Paris]] where he was stationed until his death in 1880.
