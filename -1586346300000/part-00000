He had served under a commander named [[Abdul Khadar]].  It was during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and everyone joined one or another of the groups resisting the Soviets.  When the Taliban came to power he cut all ties with HiG.\n\nHe said he thought the Taliban would bring unity to Afghanistan, and the tribal and regional wars would disappear, and had gone to enlist with them. However, they threw him in prison, because of his earlier association with HiG.\n\nHe denied that he controlled a weapons cache.  He stated that he was illiterate, and this  would have barred him from such an important task.\n\nHe said he was not arrested in the home of an al-Qaeda financier.  He said he was arrested in a house where he had been told to stay by [[Mullah Izat]], a [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] commander, when he had returned to Afghanistan.  After he escaped from the Taliban he and his family had been staying in Pakistan, as refugees, during the Taliban's time in power.\n\nHe said that he had some responsibilities for a group of fighters - but fifteen years ago, during the Soviet occupation.  Further, he had not been that group's commander, but rather he was the one sent to the market to shop for foodstuff.\n\nHe said that when the Americans evicted the Taliban he wanted to work to help bring former king [[Zahir Shah]] back to power.  He said he made contact with General [[Rahim Wardak]].  He said  [[Afghan Defense Ministry|Defense Minister]] [[Fahim Khan]] and [[Besmil Khan]], the commander of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] sent him a message:\n\n<blockquote>...don't do this; we are [[mujahedin]], and the King is a Western guy, and we don't need him.  This won't be good for your future.</blockquote>\n\nHe had once attended a speech by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], the founder of HiG. However, he had never met him.\n\nWhen told that the Tribunal was going to go into closed session, to consider the classified evidence, he was asked if there was anything he said during any of his interrogations that he wanted to expand on, or correct.  He replied that the allegations about storing weapons and about the leadership meeting were new.  He had never been asked about them during his interrogations.\n\nThe Tribunal officers commented on his willingness to cooperate, and asked why he was wearing an orange uniform.\n\n=== Witness ===\n\nHis witness was [[Nasrat Khan]].  Khan testified that he had known Hamidullah's father in the HiG and that he met Hamidullah when he joined, as a teenager.  He testified that he remembered Hamidullah's desertion.\n\n=== Hamidullah's orange uniform ===\n\nHamidullah's Tribunal officers asked him to explain why he was wearing an orange uniform\u2014the uniform issued to Guantanamo captives regarded as \"[[compliant (JTF-GTMO)|non-compliant]]\".\n\n{|\n| '''Q:''' || I wonder why you're still wearing an orange uniform, and are not wearing a white or tan uniform.\n|-\n| '''A:''' || Yes, I've only been in this [color] two days.\n|-\n| '''Q:''' || What color were you before?\n|-\n| '''A:''' || White.

This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch.

He had served under a commander named [[Abdul Khadar]].  It was during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and everyone joined one or another of the groups resisting the Soviets.  When the Taliban came to power he cut all ties with HiG.\n\nHe said he thought the Taliban would bring unity to Afghanistan, and the tribal and regional wars would disappear, and had gone to enlist with them. However, they threw him in prison, because of his earlier association with HiG.\n\nHe denied that he controlled a weapons cache.  He stated that he was illiterate, and this  would have barred him from such an important task.\n\nHe said he was not arrested in the home of an al-Qaeda financier.  He said he was arrested in a house where he had been told to stay by [[Mullah Izat]], a [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] commander, when he had returned to Afghanistan.  After he escaped from the Taliban he and his family had been staying in Pakistan, as refugees, during the Taliban's time in power.\n\nHe said that he had some responsibilities for a group of fighters - but fifteen years ago, during the Soviet occupation.  Further, he had not been that group's commander, but rather he was the one sent to the market to shop for foodstuff.\n\nHe said that when the Americans evicted the Taliban he wanted to work to help bring former king [[Zahir Shah]] back to power.  He said he made contact with General [[Rahim Wardak]].  He said  [[Afghan Defense Ministry|Defense Minister]] [[Fahim Khan]] and [[Besmil Khan]], the commander of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] sent him a message:\n\n<blockquote>...don't do this; we are [[mujahedin]], and the King is a Western guy, and we don't need him.  This won't be good for your future.</blockquote>\n\nHe had once attended a speech by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], the founder of HiG. However, he had never met him.\n\nWhen told that the Tribunal was going to go into closed session, to consider the classified evidence, he was asked if there was anything he said during any of his interrogations that he wanted to expand on, or correct.  He replied that the allegations about storing weapons and about the leadership meeting were new.  He had never been asked about them during his interrogations.\n\nThe Tribunal officers commented on his willingness to cooperate, and asked why he was wearing an orange uniform.\n\n=== Witness ===\n\nHis witness was [[Nasrat Khan]].  Khan testified that he had known Hamidullah's father in the HiG and that he met Hamidullah when he joined, as a teenager.  He testified that he remembered Hamidullah's desertion.\n\n=== Hamidullah's orange uniform ===\n\nHamidullah's Tribunal officers asked him to explain why he was wearing an orange uniform\u2014the uniform issued to Guantanamo captives regarded as \"[[compliant (JTF-GTMO)|non-compliant]]\".\n\n{|\n| '''Q:''' || I wonder why you're still wearing an orange uniform, and are not wearing a white or tan uniform.\n|-\n| '''A:''' || Yes, I've only been in this [color] two days.\n|-\n| '''Q:''' || What color were you before?\n|-\n| '''A:''' || White.
