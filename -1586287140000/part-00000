He published non-fiction using his given name and fiction as '''John Taine'''.\n\n==Biography==\n\nBell was born in Peterhead, [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, but his father, a [[factor (Scotland)|factor]], relocated to [[San Jose, California]] in 1884, when he was fifteen months old. The family returned to [[Bedford]], England after his father's death, on January 4, 1896. Bell returned to the United States by way of [[Montreal]] in 1902.\n\nBell was educated at [[Bedford Modern School]], where his teacher [[Edward Mann Langley]] inspired him to continue the study of mathematics, [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Washington]], and [[Columbia University]]<ref name=Notices2013>{{Citation | last1 = Goodstein  | first1 = Judith R. |author1-link=Judith R.

He attempted\u2014not altogether successfully\u2014to make the traditional [[umbral calculus]] (understood at that time to be the same thing as the \"symbolic method\" of Blissard) logically rigorous. He also did much work using [[generating function]]s, treated as formal [[power series]], without concern for [[limit of a sequence|convergence]]. He is the eponym of the [[Bell polynomials]] and the [[Bell number]]s of [[combinatorics]]. In 1924 he was awarded the [[B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize]] for his work in [[mathematical analysis]]. He died in 1960 in [[Watsonville, California]].\n\n==Fiction and poetry==\nDuring the early 1920s, Bell wrote several long poems.

However, [[Tirana]] had commercial airline services before. Domestic aviation started in 1926 when German airline Adria-Aero-Lloyd obtained a monopoly for all domestic air routes in the country and begin servicing Tirana, [[Shkod\u00ebr]], [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] and [[Vlor\u00eb]]. These operations proved unprofitable, and the airline sold its rights to Italian company [[Ala Littoria]] which opened regular routes in 1935 between Tirana to Shkod\u00ebr, Kuk\u00ebs, Peshkopia, Ku\u00e7ova, Vlor\u00eb, and Gjirokastra.<ref name=\"Elsie\">[https://books.google.pt/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=ala+littoria+tirana&source=bl&ots=dPuS2IN5IZ&sig=ScH0eSoVqtlAYj_e14-l8tOuHIs&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG-9en6YjeAhWSt4sKHW0eDaEQ6AEwB3oECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=ala%20littoria%20tirana&f=false Historical Dictionary of Albania] by Robert Elsie, pages 5 and 6</ref> In 1938, the Yugoslav carrier [[Aeroput]] introduced regular commercial flights linking Tirana with [[Belgrade]], Serbia with a landing in [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|title=DRUSTVO ZA VAZDUSNI SAOBRACAJ A D \u2013 AEROPUT (1927-1948)|url=http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/|website=europeanairlines.no|accessdate=17 June 2010|language=English|quote=In addition a new air service (No.2008) to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's small narbour(sic, probably neighbor), Albania, was opened. From August Aeroput flew from Beograd with a landing at Ragusa to Tirana, the capital of Albania.}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War and installation of an isolationist communist regime in Albania, air transportation was rare. From 1944 and 1948 there was a service to Belgrade, but after the break of relations with Yugoslavia, until 1953, there was only a twice-a-month connection to Budapest operated by Soviet-Hungarian company Maszovlet.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/> From 1953 and 1955 there was no air service, until February 1955 when a route to Moscow was inaugurated, followed thereafter to other Eastern-European capitals. In the 1970s, Tirana was one of the first European cities to be served by China's [[CAAC Airlines]], with a weekly flight to Beijing via Bucharest and Tehran. In the late 1980s there were six airlines flying to Tirana, with a total of nine round-trips per week.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/>\n\nWith the [[fall of communism in Albania|collapse of communism]] in Albania in 1991 and subsequent liberalisation of travel restrictions abroad for [[Albanians]], the number of airlines operating at the airport increased rapidly. In 1999 there were 8,249 flights and 356,823 passengers, seven times more than in 1991.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/>\n\n===Post-communism===\nThe air traffic equipment and facilities of the airport have been heavily modernised, following investments by Tirana International Airport SHPK, a consortium led by [[Hochtief AirPort]].

These operations proved unprofitable, and the airline sold its rights to Italian company [[Ala Littoria]] which opened regular routes in 1935 between Tirana to Shkod\u00ebr, Kuk\u00ebs, Peshkopia, Ku\u00e7ova, Vlor\u00eb, and Gjirokastra.<ref name=\"Elsie\">[https://books.google.pt/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=ala+littoria+tirana&source=bl&ots=dPuS2IN5IZ&sig=ScH0eSoVqtlAYj_e14-l8tOuHIs&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG-9en6YjeAhWSt4sKHW0eDaEQ6AEwB3oECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=ala%20littoria%20tirana&f=false Historical Dictionary of Albania] by Robert Elsie, pages 5 and 6</ref> In 1938, the Yugoslav carrier [[Aeroput]] introduced regular commercial flights linking Tirana with [[Belgrade]], Serbia with a landing in [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|title=DRUSTVO ZA VAZDUSNI SAOBRACAJ A D \u2013 AEROPUT (1927-1948)|url=http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/|website=europeanairlines.no|accessdate=17 June 2010|language=English|quote=In addition a new air service (No.2008) to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's small narbour(sic, probably neighbor), Albania, was opened. From August Aeroput flew from Beograd with a landing at Ragusa to Tirana, the capital of Albania.}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War and installation of an isolationist communist regime in Albania, air transportation was rare. From 1944 and 1948 there was a service to Belgrade, but after the break of relations with Yugoslavia, until 1953, there was only a twice-a-month connection to Budapest operated by Soviet-Hungarian company Maszovlet.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/> From 1953 and 1955 there was no air service, until February 1955 when a route to Moscow was inaugurated, followed thereafter to other Eastern-European capitals. In the 1970s, Tirana was one of the first European cities to be served by China's [[CAAC Airlines]], with a weekly flight to Beijing via Bucharest and Tehran. In the late 1980s there were six airlines flying to Tirana, with a total of nine round-trips per week.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/>\n\nWith the [[fall of communism in Albania|collapse of communism]] in Albania in 1991 and subsequent liberalization of travel restrictions abroad for [[Albanians]], the number of airlines operating at the airport increased rapidly. In 1999 there were 8,249 flights and 356,823 passengers, seven times more than in 1991.<ref name=\"Elsie\"/>\n\n===Post-communism===\nThe air traffic equipment and facilities of the airport have been heavily modernised, following investments by Tirana International Airport SHPK, a consortium led by [[Hochtief AirPort]].

It was the first ''doctrina'' (a mission with a resident priest) in Florida west of the [[St. Johns River]]. The mission was at the south edge of present-day [[San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park]] (\"San Felasco\" is derived from the 18th-century [[Seminole]] pronunciation of \"San Francisco\").<ref>Milanich:118</ref>\n\nThe [[Potano]] Indians were enemies of the Spanish for some 30 years after the founding of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in 1565. In 1597 the chiefs of the Potano and other [[Timucua#Tribes|Western Timucuan]] tribes had pledged allegiance to the governor of ''[[Spanish Florida|la Florida]]'' in St. Augustine. Franciscan missionaries began visiting Western Timucuan villages that year, but a rebellion in [[Guale]] Province disrupted missionary efforts in Florida for a decade; missionaries continued to make occasional visits, but permanent missions were not established, even though chiefs requested them and returned to St. Augustine to renew their vows of allegiance to the Spanish authorities. The arrival of additional Franciscan missionaries in 1605 allowed the establishment of permanent missions in Western Timucua to proceed, beginning with the mission of San Francisco de Potano in 1606.<ref>Milanich:116-118</ref>\n\nSoon after Father Prieto and Serrano established the mission of San Francisco, Father Prieto established the nearby missions of Santa Ana de Potano and San Miguel de Potano. Opposition from the villagers at San Francisco de Potano forced Father Prieto to return to St. Augustine, and the mission became a ''visita'' (mission without a resident priest) served by Father Serrano, who resided at the mission of San Miguel de Potano. A fourth mission in the area, [[San Buenaventura de Potano]] was established a short time later. Initially, the four Potano missions served about 1,200 Indians, about 400 of whom were at San Francisco. The rapid decline of the Potano population due to repeated epidemics led to the abandonment of the San Miguel and San Buenaventura missions within a few years, with the survivors relocated to San Francisco and Santa Ana.<ref>Milanich:118-9</ref>\n\nAt least one of the cattle ranches operated by the Spanish in Florida in the later part of the 17th century was located near San Francisco de Potano. Gabriel Diaz Vara Calder\u00f3n, Bishop of Cuba, who visited the Florida missions in 1674\u20135, noted that the San Francisco mission was abandoned. However, a mission at San Francisco did exist at the beginning of the 18th century. Starting the 1680s and accelerating after 1700 during [[Queen Anne's War]], the [[English people|English]] of the [[Province of Carolina]] and various Indian tribes allied with them repeatedly attacked Spanish missions in Florida. After the destruction of the mission buildings at [[Santa F\u00e9 de Toloca]] (a few miles from San Francisco de Potano) in 1702, that mission was merged into the mission at San Francisco in 1703. By 1704 San Francisco was fortified, one of the few Spanish outposts left west of the St. Johns River. The remaining Indians at San Francisco de Potano moved east of the [[St. Johns River]] in 1706, abandoning the mission 100 years after it was established.<ref>Milanich:155, 184, 187-8<br>Wenhold:8</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Milanich, Jerald T.

Unfortunately for the City of Whyalla, the main runway's [[Pavement Classification Number]] (PCN) has deteriorated from 13{{When|date=August 2009}} to the current PCN of 8.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> This has put a stop to all heavy aircraft, such as the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], using the airport.{{When|date=August 2009}} Although such aircraft never operated on a RPT (Regular Passenger Transport) basis, they were a fairly common sight at Whyalla Airport due to charters.{{When|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe airport remained open for use by the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] C-130 Hercules transport aircraft until the late 1990s. The City of Whyalla, aware of the accelerating damage caused by [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] operations, asked the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] for financial assistance in upgrading the main runway to accommodate unrestricted C-130 operations. The idea was for the airport to accommodate medium-sized commercial jets as well as the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) aircraft. The government declined to offer the City of Whyalla financial assistance to upgrade the main runway. John Smith (then the Mayor of Whyalla) immediately{{When|date=August 2009}} put a stop to all C-130 operations in Whyalla, causing the RAAF to use either [[RAAF Woomera Airfield]] or [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] to fly in troops and supplies for the nearby [[Cultana Training Area]]. This restriction is still in place today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAs of 2008, the main runway remains substandard for anything other than [[Saab 340]] use or lower. This is significant, because the airport is still listed by [[Qantas]] and [[Virgin Australia]] as the alternate for [[Adelaide Airport]] should that airport become inoperable for whatever reason.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In 2004, Qantas requested permission to land a [[Boeing 767]] at Whyalla Airport as both Adelaide and [[Melbourne Airport|Melbourne]] airports were closed due to fog. Council made the runway available should Qantas need it, but only on the understanding that the Boeing may not be able to take off again. The Qantas [[Boeing 767]] made it safely to its intended destination, but the whole incident highlighted the need for Whyalla to upgrade its main runway to safely accommodate such aircraft in the future.\n\nWhyalla Airport is now{{When|date=August 2009}} in a difficult position as the South Australian mining boom gets underway. The city would make an ideal [[fly-in fly-out|fly in/fly out]] location for the new mines,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minerals.org.au/file_upload/files/resources/vision2020/MCA_2020_Vision_SA_report_FINAL.pdf|title=Vision 2020 Project:Australian Mineral Industry's Infrastructure Path to Prosperity|publisher=Minerals Council of Australia|date=May 2009|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> but lacks the infrastructure to accommodate commercial jets. The City of Whyalla lacks the funds to initiate an upgrade of the main runway and both the Australian and [[Government of South Australia|State Governments]] are reluctant to financially help out, regardless of which political party is in power. Although Whyalla is now{{When|date=August 2009}} growing again, there is no doubt that such growth will be stunted if the local airport cannot be upgraded to the specifications needed by both defence and the mining industry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOn Wednesday, 17 September 2008, it was announced that the City of Whyalla were investigating spending over A$4 million on upgrading the airport to accept Boeing 737 aircraft.

One source of funding the council is looking at is selling some of the airport land (of which there is plenty surrounding the actual airport itself) to raise the required funds.

She returned for a brief appearance in December 2012, before returning full-time in February 2013. In September 2015, Dermot Walsh left again to go on maternity leave. She returned full-time from March 2016 onwards.\n\nZara has been involved in a number of different storylines, including being kidnapped, dealing with [[early menopause]] the birth of [[Joe Carmichael|her son]], her relationship with [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] ([[Matthew Chambers]]), and her feud with stepdaughter [[Izzie Torres]] (Bethan Moore).\n\n==Storylines==\nZara first appears in June 2009 when [[Heston Carter]] ([[Owen Brenman]]), [[Julia Parsons]] ([[Diane Keen]]) and [[Lily Hassan]] ([[Seeta Indrani]]) are interviewing for a new [[General practitioner|GP]]. Zara arrives at The Mill and is introduced. [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] ([[Matthew Chambers]]) flirts with her, and Zara turns up at Daniel's apartment.

Zara denies this, but it is later revealed that they have met previously. Zara asks Daniel to use his charm on Judith when she comes for Botox treatment in his clinic. Afterwards, Zara asks Daniel to seduce Judith and have sex with her, to which he declines this immediately.\n\nAfter months of dates and casual sex, Zara and Daniel become a couple. Zara then starts having hot flushes and menopausal symptoms, and realises she is undergoing [[early menopause]]. Zara believes Daniel wants to end the relationship a couple of days later, so she ends it first. Daniel traps Zara in her office and they get back together. \n\nDaniel and Zara try IVF, and are left devastated when they discover it has not worked and she is not pregnant. Zara begins showing the signs of pregnancy, and Daniel rushes out to a chemist; when he returns, Zara is sitting on the bed with a pregnancy test in her hands. After Daniel tells her that he loves her, she reveals the results of the test, and both she and Daniel are overjoyed to discover that she is pregnant. Zara goes into premature labour at the Mill, with only [[Cherry Clay]] ([[Sophie Abelson]]) and [[Kevin Tyler (Doctors)|Kevin Tyler]] ([[Simon Rivers]]) around to help her. Zara gives birth to a baby boy named [[Joe Granger Carmichael|Joe]] (Emily and Lewis Whitehouse). Daniel arrives shortly after and Zara, Daniel and their baby are taken to hospital. After much debate regarding the welfare of their new baby leaving the safety of the hospital, they return home. \n\nAfter discovering that Daniel had slept with Cherry, Zara ends the relationship with him, and leaves with Joe in August 2012. Zara returns in December 2012 for a meeting with [[Howard Bellamy]] ([[Ian Kelsey]]).

While outside, Zara witnesses a stabbing and chooses to give evidence. During this time, Joe is kidnapped, and the family have to be protected by the police due to the possibility of violence and threats from gang members who were involved in the murder. Daniel blames Zara for risking the safety of their family for the sake of assisting with the investigation.\n\nIn 2018, following some ups and downs with other staff, Daniel and Zara become the only partners at The Mill Health Centre. Daniel's daughter, [[Izzie Torres]] (Bethan Moore) comes to stay with them after arguing with her mother. Zara is still traumatised from the threats and kidnapping of Joe.

Zara enters a relationship with [[Adam Regan]] ([[Edward MacLiam]]), and while waiting for him to come home from work, his twin brother [[Gareth Regan|Gareth]] ([[Edward MacLiam]]) pretends to be Adam, and tries to rape Zara. She fights him off, spraying hairspray in his eyes and stabbing him in the leg with the heels of her shoe, and calls the police. Due to her seeing Gareth's face when she looks at Adam, she ends the relationship.\n\n==Creation==\n===Characterisation===\nSpeaking of Zara, Walsh said in an interview with ''[[OK!]]'' magazine: \"I think it would be fair to call Zara a bit of a handful! She's quite the volatile personality, and I grabbed the character with both hands. She\u2019s been a bit of a home-wrecker in the past, but I like her; even when you\u2019re playing a baddie, you have to play a baddie like you\u2019re playing a heroine. She behaves appallingly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d particularly want her as a friend, but she\u2019d be a great fun ride if you\u2019re with Zara!\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/posts/view/34883/Interview-Matthew-Chambers-and-Elisabeth-Dermot-Walsh-/ |title=Latest Celebrity News &#124; OK!

We have some brilliant writers, so Zara does get the last laugh so often. But that makes it all the more enjoyable when she doesn't get the last laugh and ends up with egg on her face. That only really works if she's had a few weeks of really getting away with everything, and then when it all goes wrong for her, she simply can't believe it!. She went on to say: \"Equally with her vulnerable moments - I think they really work when there are fewer of them, because then they're more of a surprise. We see her hard exterior, but then we know that in private, she's just like the rest of us and is full of doubts and fears.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Published Monday, Feb 6 2012, 00:01 GMT |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s16/doctors/scoop/a364048/doctors-elisabeth-dermot-walsh-interview-part-two.html |title='Doctors' Elisabeth Dermot Walsh interview - Part Two - Doctors News - Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n===Relationships===\nIn September 2010, Dermot-Walsh revealed details of an upcoming storyline involving Zara and [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] portrayed by [[Matthew Chambers]].

She returned for a brief appearance in December 2012, before returning full-time in February 2013. In September 2015, Dermot Walsh left again to go on maternity leave. She returned full-time from March 2016 onwards.\n\nZara has been involved in a number of different storylines, including being kidnapped, dealing with [[early menopause]] the birth of [[Joe Carmichael|her son]], her relationship with [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] ([[Matthew Chambers]]), and her feud with stepdaughter [[Izzie Torres]] (Bethan Moore).\n\n==Storylines==\nZara first appears in June 2009 when [[Heston Carter]] ([[Owen Brenman]]), [[Julia Parsons]] ([[Diane Keen]]) and [[Lily Hassan]] ([[Seeta Indrani]]) are interviewing for a new [[General practitioner|GP]]. Zara arrives at The Mill and is introduced. [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] ([[Matthew Chambers]]) flirts with her, and Zara turns up at Daniel's apartment. The pair have sex, but Zara ends the relationship right after, stating that they needed to get it out of the way before they could work together.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nAfter being kidnapped with [[Jack Hollins]] ([[Nicolas Woodman]]), the pair have sex.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> After an ongoing affair, eventually Jack told his dad, [[Rob Hollins (Doctors)|Rob Hollins]] ([[Chris Walker (actor)|Chris Walker]]) that he had been in a relationship with Zara. [[Karen Hollins]] ([[Jan Pearson]]) confronted Zara, and as she was doing this, Zara bent over to pick something up and Karen noticed her underwear was the same of what she found weeks ago in Jack's room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/entertainment-news/tv-news/2009/11/22/doctors-star-jan-pearson-on-black-country-accents-and-bondage-gear-66331-25218126/ |title=Doctors star Jan Pearson on Black Country accents and bondage gear |publisher=Sunday Mercury |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref> Karen then got very angry and called Zara a \"slut, whore and paedophile\", and the pair had a fight in reception. \n\nZara begins a relationship with Matthew ([[Nicholas Shaw]]) and when his mother, Judith, ([[Caroline Langrishe]]) arrives in Letherbridge, she thinks that Zara is familiar with her and knows her from somewhere else. Zara denies this, but it is later revealed that they have met previously. Zara asks Daniel to use his charm on Judith when she comes for Botox treatment in his clinic. Afterwards, Zara asks Daniel to seduce Judith and have sex with her, to which he declines this immediately.\n\nAfter months of dates and casual sex, Zara and Daniel become a couple. Zara then starts having hot flushes and menopausal symptoms, and realises she is undergoing [[early menopause]]. Zara believes Daniel wants to end the relationship a couple of days later, so she ends it first. Daniel traps Zara in her office and they get back together. \n\nDaniel and Zara try IVF, and are left devastated when they discover it has not worked and she is not pregnant. Zara begins showing the signs of pregnancy, and Daniel rushes out to a chemist; when he returns, Zara is sitting on the bed with a pregnancy test in her hands. After Daniel tells her that he loves her, she reveals the results of the test, and both she and Daniel are overjoyed to discover that she is pregnant. Zara goes into premature labour at the Mill, with only [[Cherry Clay]] ([[Sophie Abelson]]) and [[Kevin Tyler (Doctors)|Kevin Tyler]] ([[Simon Rivers]]) around to help her. Zara gives birth to a baby boy named [[Joe Granger Carmichael|Joe]] (Emily and Lewis Whitehouse). Daniel arrives shortly after and Zara, Daniel and their baby are taken to hospital. After much debate regarding the welfare of their new baby leaving the safety of the hospital, they return home. \n\nAfter discovering that Daniel had slept with Cherry, Zara ends the relationship with him, and leaves with Joe in August 2012. Zara returns in December 2012 for a meeting with [[Howard Bellamy]] ([[Ian Kelsey]]). As she is about to leave once again, she is persuaded to talk to Daniel, she reveals that she now has a job in [[Bristol]] and sees no reason to come back and leaves once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a443945/hollyoaks-return-enders-kat-reveal-corrie-affair-edale-alicia.html#~p2zTY388JSYDnS|title=Oaks return, Enders reveal, Corrie affair|author=|date=9 December 2012|website=digitalspy.co.uk|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> She returns once again after leaving her job in Bristol, and returns to work in The Mill.

However, as they start meeting up for liaisons again, Zara reveals that she will be setting strict time limits on their time together and will not be letting Daniel spend any extra time with Joe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a466240/corrie-fire-aftermath-hollyoaks-clare-enders-concern-edale-danger.html|title=Corrie fire, 'Oaks Clare, E'dale danger|author=|date=17 March 2013|website=digitalspy.co.uk|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> They later resume their relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a467941/corrie-scheme-eastenders-lexi-scare-oaks-exit-edale-wedding.html#~p2zTNGsKHyXZSd|title=Corrie scheme, Enders Lexi, Oaks exit|author=|date=24 March 2013|website=digitalspy.co.uk|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> Zara later takes a sabbatical from The Mill in September 2015 and at her leaving party she gives a speech, and tells them all to count down the days until she returns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s16/doctors/spoilers/a668008/marrow.html#ixzz3mkxZbrFk|title=Marrow|author=|date=11 September 2015|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nZara nervously returns to The Mill and is impressed by new boss Anthony Harker (Adam Astill).

While outside, Zara witnesses a stabbing and chooses to give evidence. During this time, Joe is kidnapped, and the family have to be protected by the police due to the possibility of violence and threats from gang members who were involved in the murder. Daniel blames Zara for risking the safety of their family for the sake of assisting with the investigation.\n\nIn 2018, following some ups and downs with other staff, Daniel and Zara become the only partners at The Mill Health Centre. Daniel's daughter, [[Izzie Torres]] (Bethan Moore) comes to stay with them after arguing with her mother. Zara is still traumatised from the threats and kidnapping of Joe. She struggles to get on with Izzie,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/events/doctors-spoilers-daniel-clashes-zara-izzie/|title=Doctors spoilers: Daniel Granger clashes with Zara Carmichael over daughter Izzie|last=TV|first=What' s on|website=[[What's on TV]]|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> who does not express interest in getting to know her. On one occasion, Izzie takes Joe to the shop without telling Zara. When she sees that they are missing, she panics and phones Daniel and the police. Izzie returns while Zara is broken down by the front door, and slaps Izzie. Daniel moves out and does not communicate with Zara about his plans. At the 2018 Christmas party, Emma convinces Zara to go to take her mind off Daniel's absence. Zara gets drunk and [[Sid Vere]] (Ashley Rice) comes back to her house and they have sex.

However, while attending a medical conference at a hotel, Zara and Daniel sleep together in a hotel room. Zara enters a relationship with [[Adam Regan]] ([[Edward MacLiam]]), and while waiting for him to come home from work, his twin brother [[Gareth Regan|Gareth]] ([[Edward MacLiam]]) pretends to be Adam, and tries to rape Zara. She fights him off, spraying hairspray in his eyes and stabbing him in the leg with the heels of her shoe, and calls the police. Due to her seeing Gareth's face when she looks at Adam, she ends the relationship.\n\n==Creation==\n===Characterisation===\nSpeaking of Zara, Walsh said in an interview with ''[[OK!]]'' magazine: \"I think it would be fair to call Zara a bit of a handful! She's quite the volatile personality, and I grabbed the character with both hands. She\u2019s been a bit of a home-wrecker in the past, but I like her; even when you\u2019re playing a baddie, you have to play a baddie like you\u2019re playing a heroine. She behaves appallingly.

We have some brilliant writers, so Zara does get the last laugh so often. But that makes it all the more enjoyable when she doesn't get the last laugh and ends up with egg on her face. That only really works if she's had a few weeks of really getting away with everything, and then when it all goes wrong for her, she simply can't believe it!. She went on to say: \"Equally with her vulnerable moments - I think they really work when there are fewer of them, because then they're more of a surprise. We see her hard exterior, but then we know that in private, she's just like the rest of us and is full of doubts and fears.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Published Monday, Feb 6 2012, 00:01 GMT |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s16/doctors/scoop/a364048/doctors-elisabeth-dermot-walsh-interview-part-two.html |title='Doctors' Elisabeth Dermot Walsh interview - Part Two - Doctors News - Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n===Relationships===\nIn September 2010, Dermot-Walsh revealed details of an upcoming storyline involving Zara and [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] portrayed by [[Matthew Chambers]].

At school the most important transition is from concrete thinking - which deals with facts and descriptions, to abstract thinking - any thinking which involves a mental process. From Vygotsky, CA takes the concept of [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (ZPD): the difference between what a learner can do with and without help. The CA method requires a mediator to ask questions that allow \"guided self-discovery\". Mediation is effective between peers and promotes the idea of pupils working in groups to solve a problem.\n\n==Materials==\nThe first teaching materials, written for Years 7 and 8 (ages 11\u201313) science lessons, were called Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE). After three years the results of intervening in science teaching in a dozen classes were compared with control classes which were taught in the usual way.

Learners need to \"construct\"  meaning for themselves. Lessons centre on a challenge which can only be mastered by using an abstract idea. Early CASE lessons focus on: classification, scale, ratio, proportion, probability, variables, fair testing.\n\n;Role of the mediator\nThe teacher sets up good learning-context and intervenes to guide the learners toward the learning goal. A mediator asks probing questions:  \"What do you think?\", \"Which one will heat up most?\"  \"What's happening to the atoms?\"  gradually leading the learners to discover the answer for themselves. The mediator can offer clues which direct the learner, improving the chance of successful thinking.\n\nLessons which develop abstract thinking directly have the following structure.\n\n'''Setting the scene''' Concrete preparation serves a similar purpose to the \"bridging\" section and links the activity to current knowledge, explains the task and checks vocabulary.\n\n'''Challenge''' Challenge must be set just above the current level of secure knowledge - hard enough to be a challenge, but not so hard as to make the learners switch off.  In a science lesson this can take the form of a demonstration with an unexpected effect.  In English it could be reading a text which has an implied meaning.\n\n'''Group work''' The teacher cannot be the mediator for every child in the class. If pupils work in groups and discuss their ideas (social construction) there are several benefits:\n* group members act as mediators for each other, suggesting solutions, trying out ideas.\n* individuals feel less vulnerable and more able to participate.\n* random ideas from group-members act as the clues offered by the mediator.\n\n'''Plenary''' Once the groups have solutions, the class shares ideas.  The teacher does not give the answer but asks a group for a solution, then asks another if they agree or disagree and why.  The discussion continues until there is agreement.  The teacher leads the group towards the answer through questioning.\n\n'''Meta cognition''' During group-work and the plenary, the teacher asks questions that reveal the thinking process, meta-cognition, which has been shown to be effective in securing knowledge.  The learner has to enunciate a line of thinking - making the process available to others.\n\n'''Bridging''' Knowledge in isolation from the learner's secure knowledge is usually lost. The learner needs to bridge new learning to existing experiences.  CA lessons conclude with a discussion about where ideas could be used in everyday life, the same concept as \"scaffolding\" in constructivism.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Adey, P. & Shayer, M.

Domain names cannot begin or end with a hyphen symbol, and may not contain two consecutive hyphens. The entire domain name may not contain more than 253 characters.<ref name=\"rfc1034\">{{IETF RFC|1035}}, ''Domain names--Implementation and specification'', P. Mockapetris (Nov 1987)</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nThe right to administer domain names is given to approved organisations by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA). The Internet Computer Bureau (ICB) administers .io domains. This [[domain name registry]] is a British company, and operates for this purpose under the name [[Network information center|NIC]].IO.  The company also holds the rights to sell the [[.sh]] and [[.ac]] domains, the top-level domains for the Islands of [[Saint Helena]] and [[Ascension Island|Ascension]], respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icb.co.uk/ |title=Internet Computer Bureau}}</ref>\n\n===Registration and restrictions===\nIndividuals and organisations are allowed to register .io domains.\n\nApplicants for the registration of .io domains do not need to be registered or established in the British Indian Ocean Territory. Third-level domains, such as ''\"xyz.com.io\"'', can only be registered by an inhabitant of the area. (Since there are no legal, permanent inhabitants of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], theoretically no third-level domains will be registered.) Any [[second-level domain]]s used by NIC.IO and [[top-level domain]]s cannot be used as a third-level domain. For example, the domains \"com.com.io\", \"org.com.io\", and \"biz.com.io\" are all restricted.<ref name=\"nic.io rules\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nic.io/rules.html |title=RULES for the .IO Domain and Sub-Domains |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023213418/http://www.nic.io/rules.html |archive-date=2005-10-23 |access-date=2005-07-30}}</ref>\n\nDomain names in .io may not be used, \"for any purpose that is sexual or pornographic or that is against the [[statutory law]]s of any nation.\" If this requirement is breached, \"NIC.IO reserves the right to immediately deactivate the offending registration.\"<ref name=\"nic.io\" />\n\n.io domains may be registered for a minimum of one year, and a maximum of 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nic.io/pricelist.xzx |title=.IO Domain Name Registration price list |website=nic.io |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122144009/http://nic.io/pricelist.xzx |archive-date=2017-01-22 |access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref>\n\nDomain names in .io are priced higher than those in other TLDs. Registering an available .io-domain currently (at 29 September 2019) costs US$90 per annum.<ref name=\"nic.io\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nic.io/ |title=NIC.IO - The Indian Ocean .IO Domain Registry and Network Information Centre |website=nic.io}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nThe .io domain has considerable usage unrelated to the British Indian Ocean Territory.\n\nIn [[computer science]], \"IO\" or \"I/O\" is commonly used as an abbreviation for [[input/output]], which makes the .io domain desirable for services that want to be associated with technology. .io domains are often used for [[Free and open-source software|open source]] projects, application programming interfaces (\"APIs\"), [[startup company|startup companies]], [[video game]]s, and other online services.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services |title=The rise of .io domains for well crafted web services |last=Beattie |first=Russell |date=2013-02-12 |access-date=2014-04-24 |quote=There's lots of open source projects (Redis, Brackets, Launcher), a few mobile-app landing pages (Avocado, X-Ray), a ton of new web apps and services, several conference pages (Lightning, Renaissance, Resonate) and a few older companies or organizations who've changed their name to take advantage of a cleaner .io name.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://techslides.com/io-domains-in-alexa-top-1-million |title=IO Domains in Alexa Top 1 Million. |access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe TLD is also used for [[domain hacks]], as the letters \"io\" are an ending of many English terms. For example, Rub.io is a shortened URL that was used for [[Marco Rubio presidential campaign, 2016|the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign]] of [[Marco Rubio]].\n\nOne reason given for the TLD's popularity is that it stands out by being shorter than other TLDs.

Third-level domains, such as ''\"xyz.com.io\"'', can only be registered by an inhabitant of the area. (Since there are no legal, permanent inhabitants of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], theoretically no third-level domains will be registered.)
