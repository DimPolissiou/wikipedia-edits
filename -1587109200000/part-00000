The latter sense is now mainly historical,<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd Edition (1989)</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo-Indian Anglo-Indian], [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]].</ref> but confusions can arise. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', for example, gives ''three'' possibilities: \"Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain or (chiefly historical) of English descent or birth but living or having lived long in India\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web|title=Anglo-Indian|work=Oxford Dictionary Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Anglo-Indian|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref> People fitting the middle definition are more usually known as [[British Asian]] or [[British Indian]]. This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct [[minority group|minority community]] of mixed [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] ancestry, whose native language is [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the [[British Raj|centuries that Britain was in India]], the children born to unions between British men and Indian women (and vice versa) began to form a new community.  These Anglo-Indians formed a small but significant portion of the population during the [[British Raj]], and were well represented in certain administrative roles.  The documented Anglo-Indian population dwindled from roughly two million [[Indian Independence Act 1947|at the time of independence in 1947]] to 300,000 - 1,000,000 by 2010. The nature of British-Indian relationships and stigma during the colonial period often meant that many Anglo-Indians were undocumented or incorrectly racially identified during the British Raj. Many have adapted to local communities in India or emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States and New Zealand where they are part of the larger [[Indian diaspora]].<ref name=\"Fisher, Michael H. 2007\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Some corner of a foreign field |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17312300 |newspaper=The Economist |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119140656/http://www.economist.com/node/17312300| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThis process was replicated in many other meetings of European men (traders, soldiers, administrators, infrastructure builders, and so on) with women across the subcontinent, creating the [[Anglo-Burmese people]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and the [[Burgher people]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Anglo-Indian gathering.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Indian gathering.|alt=]]\nThe first use of \"Anglo-Indian\" was to describe all [[British people]] living in India.

The board of directors wrote in 1688 to its Council at [[Fort St. George]]: \"Induce by all meanes you can invent our souldiers (sic) to marry with Native women, because it will be impossible to get ordinary young women, as we have before directed, to pay their own passages although Gentlewomen sufficient do offer themselves.\" Until 1741, a special payment was made to each soldier who had his child baptised as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women there the children would be brought up as [[Roman Catholics]] rather than Protestants. The Company's officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married \"to prevent wickedness\". Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.\n\nThe British military population in India grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. In practice, only a small minority of British residents married whilst in India, and the poorer they were the less likely they were to marry. It seems that in Bengal between 1757 and 1800 only one in four British covenanted civil servants, one in eight civilian residents, and one in ten army officers married there. Amongst military other ranks the proportion was between one in fifteen and one in forty-five. Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's, Calcutta]] between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. Genteel British women were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from [[Cawnpore]]: \"Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on [[Ludgate Hill]] and some even from [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane|Old Drury]] [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.\"\n\nThe reforming zeal of Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their Royal counterparts and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12\u201317 years in the Royal Army; and in the [[Bengal]] Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately \u00a350 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with \u00a3600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780-85 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at [[Berhampore]], a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies' seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be 'finished'; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |pages=3\u201311 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nOriginally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of [[Islamic law]] outside [[Calcutta]], and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like [[Mary Sherwood]] routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the British father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the British elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |pages=15\u201319 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1821, a pamphlet entitled \"Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons\" by a \"Practical Reformer,\" was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled \"An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons.\" Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the \"East Indian Committee\" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. [[John William Ricketts]], a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of [[Madras]], he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.<ref name=autogenerated3/>\n\nAs British women began arriving in India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of officers and soldiers, British men became less likely to marry Indian women. Intermarriage declined after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Rebellion of 1857]],<ref>{{citation|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=31\u20133}}</ref> after which several [[anti-miscegenation laws]] were implemented.<ref>{{citation|title=Converting Women|first=Eliza F.|last=Kent|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US|year=2004|isbn=0-19-516507-1|pages=85\u20136}}</ref><ref>{{citation|doi=10.1353/dia.1996.0005|title=Review Essay: Colonial Figures and Postcolonial Reading|first=Suvir|last=Kaul|journal=[[Diacritics (journal)|Diacritics]]|volume=26|issue=1|year=1996|pages=74\u201389 [83\u20139]}}</ref> As a result, Eurasians were neglected by both the British and Indian populations in India.\n\n===Consolidation===\nOver generations, Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. [[Anglo-Indian cuisine|Their cuisine]], dress, speech (use of English as their [[mother tongue]]), and religion ([[Christianity]]) all served to further segregate them from the native population.  A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians.

They felt a loyalty to a British \"home\" that most had never seen and where they would gain little social acceptance. (''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' touches on the identity crisis faced by the Anglo-Indian community during the independence struggle.) They felt insecure in an India that put a premium on participation in the independence movement as a prerequisite for important government positions.\n\nMany Anglo-Indians left the country in 1947, hoping to make a new life in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], such as Australia or Canada. The exodus continued through the 1950s and 1960s and by the late 1990s most had left with many of the remaining Anglo-Indians still aspiring to leave.<ref>Anthony, Frank.

There have been nine reunions, with the latest being held in 2015 in [[Kolkata]].\n\nSeveral narratives and novels have been published recently. ''The Leopard's Call: An Anglo-Indian Love Story'' (2005) by Reginald Shires, tells of the life of two teachers at the small Bengali town of [[Falakata]], down from [[Bhutan]]; ''At the Age for Love: A Novel of Bangalore during World War II'' (2006) is by the same author.

''The Hammarskjold Killing'' (2007) by William Higham, is a novel in which a London-born Anglo-Indian heroine is caught up in a terrorist crisis in Sri Lanka.

In order to encourage the integration of the community into the larger society, the government stipulates that a certain percentage of the student body come from other Indian communities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\nIn a 2013 [[BBC News]] feature on Anglo-Indians, journalist [[Kris Griffiths]] wrote: \"It has been noted in recent years that the number of Anglo-Indians who have succeeded in certain fields is remarkably disproportionate to the community's size. For example, in the music industry there are [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] (born [[Madras]]), [[Peter Sarstedt]] ([[Delhi]]) and [[Cliff Richard]] ([[Lucknow]]).

[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Maurice Barker]] was India's first Anglo-Indian Air Marshal. At least seven other Anglo-Indians subsequently reached that post, a notable achievement for a small community. A number of others have been decorated for military achievements. Air Marshal [[Malcolm Wollen]] is often considered the man who won India's 1971 war fighting alongside [[Bangladesh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sumgenius.com.au/anglo_indians_in_the_air_force.htm |title=Anglo-Indians in the Indian Air Force |publisher=Sumgenius.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref> Anglo-Indians made similarly significant contributions to the Indian Navy and Army.<ref>Anthony, Frank. Britain's Betrayal in India: The Story of the Anglo Indian Community. Second Edition. London: The Simon Wallenberg Press.</ref>\n\nAnother field in which Anglo-Indians won distinction was education. The second most respected matriculation qualification in India, the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]], was started and built by some of the community's best known educationalists, including [[Frank Anthony]], who served as its president, and [[A.E.T. Barrow]], its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.\n\nIn sporting circles Anglo-Indians have made a significant contribution, particularly at Olympic level where [[Norman Pritchard]] became India's first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the [[1900 Olympic Games]] in Paris, France. In [[cricket]] [[Roger Binny]] was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]] triumph. [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]] was India's first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.\n\nSeveral charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India. Foremost among these is CTR (Calcutta Tiljallah Relief \u2013 based in the US), which has instituted a senior pension scheme, and provides monthly pensions to over 300 seniors.

The latter sense is now mainly historical,<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd Edition (1989)</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo-Indian Anglo-Indian], [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]].</ref> but confusions can arise. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', for example, gives ''three'' possibilities: \"Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain or (chiefly historical) of English descent or birth but living or having lived long in India\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web|title=Anglo-Indian|work=Oxford Dictionary Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Anglo-Indian|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref> People fitting the middle definition are more usually known as [[British Asian]] or [[British Indian]]. This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct [[minority group|minority community]] of mixed [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] ancestry, whose native language is [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the [[British Raj|centuries that Britain was in India]], the children born to unions between British men and Indian women (and vice versa) began to form a new community.  These Anglo-Indians formed a small but significant portion of the population during the [[British Raj]], and were well represented in certain administrative roles.  The documented Anglo-Indian population dwindled from roughly two million [[Indian Independence Act 1947|at the time of independence in 1947]] to 300,000 - 1,000,000 by 2010. The nature of British-Indian relationships and stigma during the colonial period often meant that many Anglo-Indians were undocumented or incorrectly racially identified during the British Raj. Many have adapted to local communities in India or emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States and New Zealand where they are part of the larger [[Indian diaspora]].<ref name=\"Fisher, Michael H. 2007\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Some corner of a foreign field |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17312300 |newspaper=The Economist |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119140656/http://www.economist.com/node/17312300| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThis process was replicated in many other meetings of European men (traders, soldiers, administrators, infrastructure builders, and so on) with women across the subcontinent, creating the [[Anglo-Burmese people]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and the [[Burgher people]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Anglo-Indian gathering.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Indian gathering.|alt=]]\nThe first use of \"Anglo-Indian\" was to describe all [[British people]] living in India.

The board of directors wrote in 1688 to its Council at [[Fort St. George]]: \"Induce by all meanes you can invent our souldiers (sic) to marry with Native women, because it will be impossible to get ordinary young women, as we have before directed, to pay their own passages although Gentlewomen sufficient do offer themselves.\" Until 1741, a special payment was made to each soldier who had his child baptised as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women there the children would be brought up as [[Roman Catholics]] rather than Protestants. The Company's officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married \"to prevent wickedness\". Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.\n\nThe British military population in India grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. In practice, only a small minority of British residents married whilst in India, and the poorer they were the less likely they were to marry. It seems that in Bengal between 1757 and 1800 only one in four British covenanted civil servants, one in eight civilian residents, and one in ten army officers married there. Amongst military other ranks the proportion was between one in fifteen and one in forty-five. Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's, Calcutta]] between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. Genteel British women were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from [[Cawnpore]]: \"Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on [[Ludgate Hill]] and some even from [[Covent Garden]] and [[Drury Lane|Old Drury]] [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.\"\n\nThe reforming zeal of Governor-General [[Lord Cornwallis]] had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their Royal counterparts and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12\u201317 years in the Royal Army; and in the [[Bengal]] Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately \u00a350 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with \u00a3600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780-85 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at [[Berhampore]], a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies' seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be 'finished'; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |pages=3\u201311 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nOriginally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of [[Islamic law]] outside [[Calcutta]], and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like [[Mary Sherwood]] routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the British father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the British elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Poor Relations: The Making of a Eurasian Community in British India 1773-1833 |publisher=Curzon Press |pages=15\u201319 |isbn=0-7007-0425-6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1821, a pamphlet entitled \"Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons\" by a \"Practical Reformer,\" was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled \"An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons.\" Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the \"East Indian Committee\" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. [[John William Ricketts]], a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of [[Madras]], he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall.

The second most respected matriculation qualification in India, the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]], was started and built by some of the community's best known educationalists, including [[Frank Anthony]], who served as its president, and [[A.E.T. Barrow]], its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.\n\nIn sporting circles Anglo-Indians have made a significant contribution, particularly at Olympic level where [[Norman Pritchard]] became India's first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the [[1900 Olympic Games]] in Paris, France. In [[cricket]] [[Roger Binny]] was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]] triumph. [[Wilson Jones (billiards player)|Wilson Jones]] was India's first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.\n\nSeveral charities have been set up abroad to help the less fortunate in the community in India.

He was also a member of the [[Polish government in exile]] during [[World War II]].  According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', he was among the earliest and most outspoken of [[Poles]] to recognise the [[Hitler]] menace to his country.  His warning was clear in his book ''The Case of Danzig'', published some months before the outbreak of World War II.<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/mirrors/nytimes/nytimes19510504p27.pdf]</ref>\n\n== Early years ==\nHe was born on 25 May 1887 in [[Warsaw]], to Juljan Teofil Strasburger (half-brother of [[Eduard Adolf Strasburger]]) and Marja (Julia Maria) Simmler, daughter of [[Joseph Simmler]]. Their ancestors were of German ethnics which had assimilated into Polish people. His schooling was at [[Heidelberg]] and [[Kharkov]] universities.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1916 to 1918, he was the Director of the Polish Industrial Association. After [[World War I]], Strasburger was a member of the first Polish [[Polish government|government]], as Undersecretary in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry from 1918 to 1923, as well as holding the position of Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1923. He was a member of the [[Peace of Riga|Polish peace delegation]] at [[Riga]] in 1921, and a delegate to the [[League of Nations]] in 1923 and 1924. He conducted commercial treaty negotiations with Italy, France, Romania, Yugoslavia, Finland, Belgium, and Japan.\n\nHe then joined the Polish [[Foreign Office]], and from 1924 to 1932 he was General Commissioner (Commissariat) of the Polish Republic (''Komisarz Generalny Rzeczpospoltej Polskiej''), responsible for the liaison between the Senate and the Polish government in the [[Free City of Danzig]].<ref>[http://www.pg.gda.pl/historia/hist1.shtml]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He resigned in 1932 and was replaced by Dr. [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]].  This was an unusual move that drew international attention since it seemed to mark an important change in Polish policy towards Danzig, as the supposedly Free City was becoming a centre for Berlin Nationalist activities.\n\nStrasburger had been allowed a free hand in dealing with Danzig authorities, and during his first few years in office had had success in improving Danzig-Polish relations, but difficulties increased in his last two years in office, caused by the new Nationalist Senate of the free city,{{lopsided|date=June 2011}} which became a stronghold of the German Nationalists and Hitlerites.{{dubious|date=June 2011}}  The Senate became increasingly hostile towards Poland, and after a public dispute in 1931 between Strasburger and the [[Administrations of Danzig before April 1945|President of Danzig]], Dr. [[Ernst Ziehm]], Strasburger offered his resignation but it was not accepted.  When he tried again to resign in 1932, the Polish Government decided that Danzig-Polish policies would be made in Warsaw, not in Danzig. From 1932 to 1939, he was the President of the Central Organisation of Polish Industries.\n\nAfter the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]], Strasburger became part of the Polish government in exile. From 1939 to 1942 he was the Polish Minister of Finance, Industry and Commerce in the [[Sikorski Government]].

He was also a member of the [[Polish government in exile]] during [[World War II]].  According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', he was among the earliest and most outspoken of [[Poles]] to recognise the [[Hitler]] menace to his country.  His warning was clear in his book ''The Case of Danzig'', published some months before the outbreak of World War II.<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/mirrors/nytimes/nytimes19510504p27.pdf]</ref>\n\n== Early years ==\nHe was born on 25 May 1887 in [[Warsaw]], to Juljan Teofil Strasburger (half-brother of [[Eduard Adolf Strasburger]]) and Marja (Julia Maria) Simmler, daughter of [[Joseph Simmler]].  His schooling was at [[Heidelberg]] and [[Kharkov]] universities.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1916 to 1918, he was the Director of the Polish Industrial Association. After [[World War I]], Strasburger was a member of the first Polish [[Polish government|government]], as Undersecretary in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry from 1918 to 1923, as well as holding the position of Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1923. He was a member of the [[Peace of Riga|Polish peace delegation]] at [[Riga]] in 1921, and a delegate to the [[League of Nations]] in 1923 and 1924. He conducted commercial treaty negotiations with Italy, France, Romania, Yugoslavia, Finland, Belgium, and Japan.\n\nHe then joined the Polish [[Foreign Office]], and from 1924 to 1932 he was General Commissioner (Commissariat) of the Polish Republic (''Komisarz Generalny Rzeczpospoltej Polskiej''), responsible for the liaison between the Senate and the Polish government in the [[Free City of Danzig]].<ref>[http://www.pg.gda.pl/historia/hist1.shtml]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He resigned in 1932 and was replaced by Dr. [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]].  This was an unusual move that drew international attention since it seemed to mark an important change in Polish policy towards Danzig, as the supposedly Free City was becoming a centre for Berlin Nationalist activities.\n\nStrasburger had been allowed a free hand in dealing with Danzig authorities, and during his first few years in office had had success in improving Danzig-Polish relations, but difficulties increased in his last two years in office, caused by the new Nationalist Senate of the free city,{{lopsided|date=June 2011}} which became a stronghold of the German Nationalists and Hitlerites.{{dubious|date=June 2011}}  The Senate became increasingly hostile towards Poland, and after a public dispute in 1931 between Strasburger and the [[Administrations of Danzig before April 1945|President of Danzig]], Dr. [[Ernst Ziehm]], Strasburger offered his resignation but it was not accepted.  When he tried again to resign in 1932, the Polish Government decided that Danzig-Polish policies would be made in Warsaw, not in Danzig. From 1932 to 1939, he was the President of the Central Organisation of Polish Industries.\n\nAfter the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]], Strasburger became part of the Polish government in exile. From 1939 to 1942 he was the Polish Minister of Finance, Industry and Commerce in the [[Sikorski Government]].
