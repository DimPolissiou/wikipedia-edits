Any state of consciousness can form a type of \"intermediate state\", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.\n\n==English translations==\n\n===Evans-Wentz's ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''===\n[[File:Bardo.

G. Jung\u2019s psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz ed.|1965}} The commentary also appears in the Collected Works.{{sfn|Jung|1977}} Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically.{{sfn|Coward|1985|}} He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung\u2019s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.{{sfn|Coward|1985|p=79-92}}\n\n===Other translations and summaries===\n* [[Edward Conze|Conze, Edward]] (1959) ''Buddhist Scriptures'' Harmondsworth: Penguin (includes a pr\u00e9cis)\n* [[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] & [[Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa]] (1975) ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo by [[Guru Rinpoche]] according to [[Karma Lingpa]].''

Any state of consciousness can form a type of \"intermediate state\", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.\n\n==English translations==\n\n===Evans-Wentz's ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''===\n[[File:Bardo.

Dr. Walter Y. Evans-Wentz chose this title because of the parallels he found with the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]].{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960}}\n\nAccording to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz's edition of the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' introduced a number of misunderstandings about [[Dzogchen]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} In fact, Evans-Wentz collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as \"The Tibetan Book of Death.\" Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje.{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=72\u201373, 78}} Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was \"fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=78}} He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical beliefs]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} Contrary to the general belief spread in the West by Evans-Wentz, in Tibetan Buddhist practice the Tibetan Book of Dead is not read to the people who are passing away, but it is rather used during life by those who want to learn to visualize what will come after death.<ref>Paul van der Velde</ref>\n\nC. G. Jung\u2019s psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz ed.|1965}} The commentary also appears in the Collected Works.{{sfn|Jung|1977}} Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically.{{sfn|Coward|1985|}} He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung\u2019s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.{{sfn|Coward|1985|p=79-92}}\n\n===Other translations and summaries===\n* [[Edward Conze|Conze, Edward]] (1959) ''Buddhist Scriptures'' Harmondsworth: Penguin (includes a pr\u00e9cis)\n* [[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] & [[Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa]] (1975) ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo by [[Guru Rinpoche]] according to [[Karma Lingpa]].''

It purports to be the charter by which \u00c6thelred granted 300 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King [[Osric, king of the Hwicce|Osric of the Hwicce]], and another 300 at Pershore to Osric's brother Oswald.<ref name=Sims94-6>Sims-Williams, ''Religion and literature'', pp. 94-6.</ref><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+70 S 70]</ref> It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of Link [[Burgred of Mercia]] (852-874).<ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+209 S 209]</ref><ref name=S1782>[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/content/charter/1782.html S 1782]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] which later made up the area of Worcestershire.<ref name=Sims94-6 /> Historian [[H. P. R. Finberg]] suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material.<ref>Finberg, ''Early charters'', pp. 153-66.</ref> Oswald's foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle ''[[Cronica de Anglia]]'', written ''c''. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], consulting the now lost ''Annals of Pershore'', places the event around 689.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref>John Leland, ''Collectanea'', ed. Hearne, pp. 240-1.</ref> Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of 1002 and again in 1223.<ref name=Sims94-6 />\n\nIn the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a minster under the patronage of [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]]. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] (r. 796-821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore.<ref name=S1782 /> A charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his [[ealdorman]] (''[[dux]]'') Beornnoth.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref name=S786>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+786 S 786]</ref>\n\n===Refoundation===\nIn the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of [[Benedictine]] reform. Writing ''c''. 1000, the Ramsey monk [[Byrhtferth]] relates that under the auspices of [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, bishop of Worcester]], seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore.<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', p. 494 (ch. 8).</ref> The first abbot was one Foldbriht,<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', pp. 494-5 (ch. 9).</ref> whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold]] previously installed at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]] and used to be a monk of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] before that time.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', p. cciii.</ref>\n\nThe refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf.<ref name=S786 /> The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. [[Simon Keynes]] in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called ''Orthodoxorum'' group of charters, so named after the initial word of their [[Preface|proem]], which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]]'s reign.<ref>Keynes, ''The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', pp. 98-100</ref> Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', pp. cxcix-cciv</ref> More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in ''c''. 1002 (see below).<ref name=Stokes72-3>Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3.</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one \u00c6thelweard (''Egelwardus''), whom he describes as \"ealdorman of Dorset\", had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar.<ref name=Gesta-iv.162>William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta pontificum'' IV, ch. 162, ed. and tr, Winterbottom and Thomson</ref> Similarly, [[Osbert de Clare|Osbert]]'s ''Life'' of [[Eadburh of Winchester]] alleges that one ''Alwardus'', who is styled ''comes'' and ''consul'', was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint's relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to \u00c6thelweard (''Alwardus''), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ridyard, ''The royal saints of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Some scholars have identified him with [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires.<ref name=World11-3>Williams, ''World before Domesday'', pp. 11-3.</ref> {{#tag:ref|A tradition at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], only 10&nbsp;miles from Pershore, also remembers a royal kinsman called \u00c6thelweard (''Haylwardus'') as its patron as well as that of [[Cranborne Abbey]] (Dorset), of which Tewkesbury was a dependency.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347>Jayakumar, \"Reform and retribution\", p. 347.</ref> The account, which places his floruit in the time of King \u00c6thelred and Dunstan, is recorded in a late chronicle of that house, written in the 15th century, but may very well be based on older sources.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347 /> This \u00c6thelweard is to be identified with the \u00c6thelweard ''M\u00e6w'' whose activities, including the foundation of Cranborne, are attested in sources closer to his day.<ref name=World11-3 /> Historian Jayakumar suggests that he may be the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], ealdorman of the western shires, as both were royal kinsmen and in the Tewkesbury Chronicle, Cranborne is said to have been founded ''in suo dominio''.<ref name=reform347 /> Ann Williams, however, prefers to see them as separate persons.<ref name=World11-3 />|group=note}}\n\nWhatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar's death.<ref name=Williams167-8>Williams, \"''Princeps Merciorum gentis''\", pp. 167-8</ref> William of Malmesbury says that \"it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half\".<ref name=Gesta-iv.162 /> According to Leland, the ''Annals of Pershore'' hold an earl called ''Delfer'' responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This ''Delfer'' has been interpreted as a misreading for [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere]] (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia<ref name=Williams167-8 /> (whom Leland mentions elsewhere).<ref name=LelandIter>\"Oswaldus ''primum instituit Canonicos seculares apud'' Persore.{{Clear}} ''Postea fuit ibidem chorus monachorum''.{{Clear}}''Rursus Canonici inducti''.{{Clear}}''Postea monachi per'' Edgarum.{{Clear}} Elferus ''abstulit pr\u00e6dia monachis''.{{Clear}}Odda ''comes ejus filius restituit''.{{Clear}}''Monasterium conflagravit & \u00e0 monachis desertum est''.{{Clear}}''Monachi'' Westmonasterienses ''pr\u00e6dia usurpabant''.{{Clear}}Wada ''comes attulit reliqias S.''

Hearne, vol. 5, p. 2.</ref> While himself a patron of Ely and Abingdon, \u00c6lfhere was also charged with despoiling reformed monasteries during [[Edward the Martyr]]'s brief reign (975-978). The targets included houses refounded by Bishop Oswald or Bishop \u00c6thelwold and considerably enriched under the patronage of \u00c6thelstan Half-King's sons, notably [[\u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|\u00c6thelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia]]. [[Evesham Abbey]], for instance, as later reported by [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|its own chronicle]], also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and [[Winchcombe]] was disbanded altogether. \u00c6thelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between \u00c6lfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval.<ref name=Williams167-8 /> Whether a liberty similar to that of [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]] was an extra cause for concern, compromising \u00c6lfhere's authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.<ref name=Williams167-8 />\n\n===\"Second\" refoundation===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey Nave.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The chancel]]\nPershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks,<ref name=LelandIter /><ref name=Victoria /> probably in the year 1002.<ref name=ODNBOdda>Williams, \"Odda, earl (''d''. 1056)\"</ref> The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman [[Odda of Deerhurst]] (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones. It has been suggested{{who|date=April 2019}} that he was a kinsman of the ealdorman \u00c6thelweard. The earliest extant record from the archive of Pershore, a charter of 1014 by which King \u00c6thelred granted Mathon (Herefordshire) to ealdorman Leofwine, may testify to Odda's restorations of lands to the house.<ref name=ODNBOdda /><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+932 S 932].</ref> The monastery was active again by the 1020s, as its abbot Brihtheah was promoted bishop of Worcester in 1033.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Odda's brother \u00c6lfric was buried at Pershore in 1053, joined three years later by Odda himself.<ref name=ODNBOdda />\n\nIn Odda's lifetime the total landed assets of Pershore grew to 300 hides, but after the loss of its benefactor in 1056 about two-thirds were seized and given to [[Edward the Confessor]]'s new foundation at Westminster.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> The original single sheet which preserves the fullest version of King Edgar's refoundation charter (though it need not be authentic) is marked by a number of textual alterations and erasures. Some of these changes may suggest a response to the abbey's proprietary struggles.<ref name=Stokes72-3 />\n\nFrom the early 12th century there is evidence that Pershore Abbey claimed possession of some of the relics of Saint [[Eadburh of Winchester]], the [[saint]]ed daughter of King [[Edward the Elder]]. Her body was initially buried at [[Nunnaminster]] (Winchester), but it was translated in the 960s to a more central spot in [[Winchester]], and again to a shrine in the 970s. Among several possibilities, Susan Ridyard has suggested that the Eadburh whose relics were preserved at Pershore may have been a Mercian saint of that name whose identity had become obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\nThe main building was begun in about 1100.  In the fourteenth century it benefitted from the generosity of [[Adam de Harvington]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] 1327\u201330, who was probably related to the Abbot, William of Harvington. The abbey was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539. A monk of Pershore, named Richard Beerly, was one of those who gave evidence to [[Thomas Cromwell]] in 1536 about the misbehaviour of some of his brothers, writing that \"Monckes drynk an bowll after collacyon tell ten or xii of the clock, and cum to mattens as dronck as myss, and sume at cardes, sume at dyss.\"{{refn|{{cite book|editor-last=Wright|editor-first=Thomas|series=Camden Society Old Series: Volume XXVI|title=Three Chapters of Letters Relating to the Suppression of Monasteries|chapter=LX.

It purports to be the charter by which \u00c6thelred granted 300 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King [[Osric, king of the Hwicce|Osric of the Hwicce]], and another 300 at Pershore to Osric's brother Oswald.<ref name=Sims94-6>Sims-Williams, ''Religion and literature'', pp. 94-6.</ref><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+70 S 70]</ref> It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of Link [[Burgred of Mercia]] (852-874).<ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+209 S 209]</ref><ref name=S1782>[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/content/charter/1782.html S 1782]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] which later made up the area of Worcestershire.<ref name=Sims94-6 /> Historian [[H. P. R. Finberg]] suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material.<ref>Finberg, ''Early charters'', pp. 153-66.</ref> Oswald's foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle ''[[Cronica de Anglia]]'', written ''c''. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], consulting the now lost ''Annals of Pershore'', places the event around 689.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref>John Leland, ''Collectanea'', ed. Hearne, pp. 240-1.</ref> Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of 1002 and again in 1223.<ref name=Sims94-6 />\n\nIn the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a minster under the patronage of [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]]. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] (r. 796-821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore.<ref name=S1782 /> A charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his [[ealdorman]] (''[[dux]]'') Beornnoth.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref name=S786>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+786 S 786]</ref>\n\n===Refoundation===\nIn the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of [[Benedictine]] reform. Writing ''c''. 1000, the Ramsey monk [[Byrhtferth]] relates that under the auspices of [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, bishop of Worcester]], seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore.<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', p. 494 (ch. 8).</ref> The first abbot was one Foldbriht,<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', pp. 494-5 (ch. 9).</ref> whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold]] previously installed at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]] and used to be a monk of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] before that time.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', p. cciii.</ref>\n\nThe refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf.<ref name=S786 /> The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. [[Simon Keynes]] in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called ''Orthodoxorum'' group of charters, so named after the initial word of their [[Preface|proem]], which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]]'s reign.<ref>Keynes, ''The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', pp. 98-100</ref> Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', pp. cxcix-cciv</ref> More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in ''c''. 1002 (see below).<ref name=Stokes72-3>Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3.</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one \u00c6thelweard (''Egelwardus''), whom he describes as \"ealdorman of Dorset\", had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar.<ref name=Gesta-iv.162>William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta pontificum'' IV, ch. 162, ed. and tr, Winterbottom and Thomson</ref> Similarly, [[Osbert de Clare|Osbert]]'s ''Life'' of [[Eadburh of Winchester]] alleges that one ''Alwardus'', who is styled ''comes'' and ''consul'', was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint's relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to \u00c6thelweard (''Alwardus''), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ridyard, ''The royal saints of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Some scholars have identified him with [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires.<ref name=World11-3>Williams, ''World before Domesday'', pp. 11-3.</ref> {{#tag:ref|A tradition at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], only 10&nbsp;miles from Pershore, also remembers a royal kinsman called \u00c6thelweard (''Haylwardus'') as its patron as well as that of [[Cranborne Abbey]] (Dorset), of which Tewkesbury was a dependency.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347>Jayakumar, \"Reform and retribution\", p. 347.</ref> The account, which places his floruit in the time of King \u00c6thelred and Dunstan, is recorded in a late chronicle of that house, written in the 15th century, but may very well be based on older sources.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347 /> This \u00c6thelweard is to be identified with the \u00c6thelweard ''M\u00e6w'' whose activities, including the foundation of Cranborne, are attested in sources closer to his day.<ref name=World11-3 /> Historian Jayakumar suggests that he may be the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], ealdorman of the western shires, as both were royal kinsmen and in the Tewkesbury Chronicle, Cranborne is said to have been founded ''in suo dominio''.<ref name=reform347 /> Ann Williams, however, prefers to see them as separate persons.<ref name=World11-3 />|group=note}}\n\nWhatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar's death.<ref name=Williams167-8>Williams, \"''Princeps Merciorum gentis''\", pp. 167-8</ref> William of Malmesbury says that \"it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half\".<ref name=Gesta-iv.162 /> According to Leland, the ''Annals of Pershore'' hold an earl called ''Delfer'' responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This ''Delfer'' has been interpreted as a misreading for [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere]] (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia<ref name=Williams167-8 /> (whom Leland mentions elsewhere).<ref name=LelandIter>\"Oswaldus ''primum instituit Canonicos seculares apud'' Persore.{{Clear}} ''Postea fuit ibidem chorus monachorum''.{{Clear}}''Rursus Canonici inducti''.{{Clear}}''Postea monachi per'' Edgarum.{{Clear}} Elferus ''abstulit pr\u00e6dia monachis''.{{Clear}}Odda ''comes ejus filius restituit''.{{Clear}}''Monasterium conflagravit & \u00e0 monachis desertum est''.{{Clear}}''Monachi'' Westmonasterienses ''pr\u00e6dia usurpabant''.{{Clear}}Wada ''comes attulit reliqias S.''

[[Evesham Abbey]], for instance, as later reported by [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|its own chronicle]], also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and [[Winchcombe]] was disbanded altogether. \u00c6thelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between \u00c6lfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval.<ref name=Williams167-8 /> Whether a liberty similar to that of [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]] was an extra cause for concern, compromising \u00c6lfhere's authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.<ref name=Williams167-8 />\n\n===\"Second\" refoundation===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey Nave.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The chancel]]\nPershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks,<ref name=LelandIter /><ref name=Victoria /> probably in the year 1002.<ref name=ODNBOdda>Williams, \"Odda, earl (''d''. 1056)\"</ref> The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman [[Odda of Deerhurst]] (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones.

Her body was initially buried at [[Nunnaminster]] (Winchester), but it was translated in the 960s to a more central spot in [[Winchester]], and again to a shrine in the 970s. Among several possibilities, Susan Ridyard has suggested that the Eadburh whose relics were preserved at Pershore may have been a Mercian saint of that name whose identity had become obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 1057540.jpg|right|300px]]\nThe main building was begun in about 1100.

The abbey was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539.

When the north [[transept]] collapsed in 1686, a wall was built in its place. Further alterations were carried out, including a [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] by [[George Gilbert Scott]] in 1862\u201364. His work included the removal of the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] floor and the opening up of the [[lantern tower]] to expose the beautiful internal tracery panelling. Scott described the lantern as the finest in the country after that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]]. The tower pinnacles were added in 1871.<ref name=Crawford>Wilson, Dr. M. and Crawford, Rev.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

When using his power, Ohm experiences [[Nosebleed|nosebleeds]] which indicate that his power has manifested. He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Korn has the ability to remain [[Wakefulness|awake]] for days without getting sleepy. He has a crush on his childhood friend Claire, until Claire rejected his love.

He is also able to both erase and restore his own memories. His power is associated with his ability to memorize many details. As the teacher, his power is taken into advantage by Director Chueamanee in erasing the memories of students who are involved in incidents related to the Gifted Program.\n* Chayapol Jutamat as Chanuj \"Jack\" Saeliu, and Chayakorn Jutamat as Chanet \"Jo\" Saeliu\n: The [[Twin|identical twin]] students of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms.

It was fought between the Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] and his opponents, the Cinna-Marius faction (usually called the Marians after their leader [[Gaius Marius]]), in the years 83-81 BC. The war ended with a [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|decisive battle]] just outside of Rome itself. After the war the victorious Sulla made himself [[Dictator (Roman)|Dictator]] of the Republic.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prelude==\nSulla had achieved temporary control of Rome and Marius's exile to [[Africa Province|Africa]]  through [[Sulla's first civil war|his first march on Rome]], but departed soon afterwards to lead the [[First Mithridatic War]].  This departure allowed [[Gaius Marius]] and his son [[Gaius Marius the younger]] to return to Rome with an army and, with [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], to wrest control of Rome back from Sulla's supporter [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]] during Sulla's absence.  Based on the orders of Marius, some of his soldiers went through Rome killing the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius.  Their heads were exhibited in the Forum.  After five days, Cinna ordered his more disciplined troops to kill Marius's rampaging soldiers.  All told some 100 Roman nobles had been murdered.  Marius declared Sulla's reforms and laws invalid, officially exiled Sulla and had himself elected to Sulla's eastern command and himself and Cinna elected consuls for the year 86 BC.  Marius died a fortnight after and Cinna was left in sole control of Rome.\n\nHaving managed this achievement, the Marians sent out [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (suffect consul 86 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] with an army to relieve Sulla of his command in the east.  Flaccus had been given as second in command [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria]], an individual that history records had few virtues.  He was to eventually agitate against his commanding officer and incite the troops to murder Flaccus.\n\nIn the meantime, the two Roman armies camped next to each other and Sulla, not for the first time, encouraged his soldiers to spread dissension among Flaccus\u2019 army.  Many deserted to Sulla before Flaccus packed up and moved on north to threaten Mithridates\u2019 northern dominions.  In the meantime Sulla moved to intercept the new [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic]] army and end the war at [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla#Battle of Orchomenus|Orchomenus]].\n\n==Course==\nWith Mithridates defeated and Cinna now dead in a [[mutiny]], Sulla was determined to regain control of Rome.\n[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|Bust of Sulla in the [[Munich]] [[Glyptothek]]]]\n\n===Events of 83 BC===\n* In the spring of 83 BC Sulla landed his army in two divisions in southern Italy; one division at [[Brundisium]] another at [[Tarento|Tarentum]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 158; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 24.</ref> \n* At Tarentum Sulla made sacrifices to the gods.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 157-158.</ref>\n* As soon as he had set foot in Italy, the outlawed nobles and old Sullan supporters who had survived the Marian-Cinna regime flocked to his banner. The most prominent among them were [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (princeps senatus 86 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] (the [[princeps senatus]]) and [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 91 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]].

When Pompey and Sulla met Sulla addressed him as [[Imperator]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.159; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. pp 24-25; Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 90; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 8.</ref>\n* [[Publius Cornelius Cethegus (senator)|Publius Cornelius Cethegus]], a firm supporter of Marius, now also joined the Sullan cause.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.160.</ref>\n* To check his enemies' unresisted advance, [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]] sent his newly elected puppet consuls, [[Gaius Norbanus]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC)|Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus]], both with armies, against Sulla. \n* When Sulla arrived in [[Campania]] he found the consul Norbanus blocking the road to [[Capua]]. Eager not to appear a war-hungry invader, Sulla sent deputations to Norbanus offering to negotiate, but these were rejected. Norbanus then moved to block Sulla's advance at [[Canusium]] and became the first to engage him in the [[Battle of Mount Tifata]]. Here Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on the Marians, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy. Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to [[Capua]]. Sulla pursued him, but was stopped by the Norbanus' consular partner, Scipio, who was encamped at Capua.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.162; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133.</ref>\n* Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle with his opponent's battle hardened army and welcomed Sulla's offer to negotiate. [[Quintus Sertorius]], one of Scipio's legates, did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were under way. Sertorius made a small detour and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to the Sullan faction. When Sulla complained about this breach of trust, Scipio sent back the hostages Sulla had given as a sigh of good faith. This behaviour by Scipio outraged Scipio's troops, who were already upset having to face Sulla's veterans. A deal was made between Scipio's soldiers and Sulla and they defected ''en masse'', further swelling his ranks. The Consul and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo. However, immediately after their release Scipio broke his promise and went straight to Carbo in Rome.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 162-165; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 133-134; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius'', pp 32-33.</ref>\n* Sulla then defeated Norbanus for a second time. Norbanus also escaped back to Rome and had Metellus Pius and all other senators marching with Sulla declared enemies of the state.\n* In Rome the elections for the consulship of 82 were held; [[Gaius Marius the Younger]] (the son of the great Gaius Marius) and Gaius Papirius Carbo (re-elected for the second time) were elected.<ref name=LTPH1>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 166; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 137.</ref>\n* At the end of the campaigning season of 83 BC, [[Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus|Marcus Lucullus]], one of Sulla's legates, defeated a numerically superior force (50 cohorts to his 16) at [[Fidentia]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 163; Plutarch, ''Life of Sulla'', 28.</ref>\n\n===Events of 82 BC===\n* The new consuls for the year 82 BC were Gaius Papirius Carbo, for his third term, and Gaius Marius the Younger, who was only 26\u201328 years old at the time.<ref name=LTPH1/>\n* In the respite from campaigning provided by Winter, the Marians set about replenishing their forces. [[Quintus Sertorius]] levied men in [[Etruria]], old veterans of Marius came out of retirement to fight under his son and the [[Samnites]] gathered their warriors in support of Carbo, hoping to destroy Sulla, the man who defeated them in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 165-167.</ref>\n* Meanwhile, Sulla had sent Crassus to recruit troops from among the [[Marsi]], Pompey to raise further legions in Picenum, and he also recruited soldiers from [[Calabria]] and [[Apulia]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 166-167; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25.</ref>\n* As the campaigning season opened, Sulla advanced along the [[Via Latina]] towards the capital and Metellus supported by Pompey led Sullan forces into northern Italy. Carbo threw himself against Metellus whilst the young Marius defended the city of Rome itself.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 26; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 168; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 137.</ref> \n* Marius the Younger marched his army south-east into Campania and met Sulla's forces at Scariportus (near Signia). After an initial engagement Sulla decided to pitch camp. While Sulla's men were preparing the camp (digging a ditch, throwing up earthworks) Marius suddenly attacked. Sulla's veterans simply stuck their [[Pilum|pila]] into the ground to create a makeshift barricade and drew their swords. When they had organized their battle lines the Sullans counter-attacked. Marius' force were put on the defensive, their left began to waver and five cohorts of foot soldiers and two of horse deserted to Sulla. This cause a general collapse and Marius army scattered in rout. Marius lost 28,000 men (killed, captured, turned coat or fled) while Sulla claimed to have only lost 23 men.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 170-172; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 138-139.</ref> \n* Marius survived the [[Battle of Sacriporto|Battle of Scariportus]] and with 7,000 men he retreated to [[Praeneste]]. At Praeneste but the terrified townspeople shut the gates. Marius himself had to be hoisted in on a rope, while hundreds of Marians trapped between the walls and the Sullans were massacred. Sulla then left his lieutenant Lucretius Afella besieging Praeneste and moved on the now-undefended Rome.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 172; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 139.</ref>   \n*  Upon his defeat Marius sent word to the praetor Lucius Junius Brutus Damasippus in Rome, to kill any remaining Sullan sympathisers left before Sulla could take the city. Damasippus called a meeting of the Senate and there, in the Curia itself, the marked men were cut down by assassins.  Some, such as [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 94 BC)|Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus]] were killed on the senate steps as they tried to flee, and the [[Pontifex Maximus]], chief priest of Rome, [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]] was murdered in the [[Temple of Vesta]], the bodies of the murdered were then thrown into the [[Tiber]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 172-173; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 139-140; [[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 1.88.</ref>    \n* Meanwhile in the north, Metellus working in tandem with Pompey fought the consul Carbo and his legates [[Gaius Carrinas (general)|Gaius Carrinas]] and [[Gaius Marcius Censorinus (general)|Gaius Marcius Censorinus]]. Metellus defeated Carrinas at the River Aesis, only to be blockaded by Carbo himself. Upon hearing that Marius the Younger had been defeated at Scariportus, Carbo withdrew to [[Ariminum]], severely harassed by cavalry attacks on his rearguard by Pompey. Some time later Metellus and Pompey defeated Censorinus near [[Sena Gallica]] and sacked the town.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 169; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 139; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 26.</ref>    \n* [[Naples|Neapolis]] fell to the Sullans through treachery, virtually the whole population was massacred.

Their two armies met near Clussium where an indecisive all-day battle was fought. The next day Sulla retreated because he was informed that the Samnites and Lucanians were threatening Afella's army at Praeneste.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 175; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 141.</ref>\n* The other Sullan force had meanwhile been completely successful, defeating its opponent near Saturnia.<ref name=LTS175/>\n* Lucius Marcius Philippus enjoyed another success on [[Sardinia]], slowly winning the island for the Sullan cause.<ref name=LTS175/>\n* Marcus Lucullus bottled up in [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] was able to break the siege.

They were ambushed along the way by Pompey who forced them back.<ref name=PMC141/>\n* A Marian attack on Metellus near [[Faventia]] went horribly wrong for them. This caused the Lucanians in Norbanus' army to contemplate to defect to Sulla. Their commander, a man called Albinovanus, hatched a plan with the Sullans to assassinate Norbanus and his senior officers (to show his good faith). At a feast Albinovanus had organized Norbanus' officers were murdered. Norbanus was unable to attend the feast and survived. After the assassination and the Lucanians defection, Ariminum went over to Sulla as well. Norbanus abandoned his army and fled from Italy.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 176-177; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 141-142.</ref>\n* Meanwhile, Sulla and his army had arrived at the siege of Praeneste. He blocked an attempt by Damasippus to reach Marius the Younger. After Damasippus failure Carbo lost heart and fled to Sicily. With their leader gone, the remainder of the Marian forces united for one final stand.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 177; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 142-143.</ref>\n* The Samnite general Pontius Telesinus and the Lucanian general Marcus Lamponius with a very large army of Samnites and Lucanians were trying to get to Praeneste to break the Sullan siege. Unfortunately for them, Sulla and his army put themselves in their path in a very defensible position. Damasippus, Censorinus and Carrinas then joined their men with the Samnites and Lucanians and together they decided to march on Rome. When Sulla found out he immediately followed them in pursuit.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 177-178; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 142-143; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 27.</ref>\n* Outside the walls of Rome, the last decisive battle of the civil war, the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]], took place; Sulla, after a very hard-fought and drawn-out battle, emerged victorious. It was afterwards estimated that ca. 50,000 men lost their lives on the battlefield that day.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 179-181; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 144-147; Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 92; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 27; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius'', p. 55; Plutarch, ''Life of Sulla'', 29; Velleius Paterculus, ''History'', 2.27.</ref>\n* Damasippus, Carrinas and Censorinus were brought to Sulla the following day and executed.

A meeting of the Senate was convened in the [[Temple of Bellona (Rome)|Temple of Bellona]]; as Sulla was addressing the senators, the sound of terrified screams drifted in from the [[Campus Martius]]. Sulla calmed the senators by attributing the screams to 'some criminals that are receiving correction.' In reality, what the Senate had heard was the sound of 8,000 prisoners who had surrendered the previous day being executed on Sulla's orders; none of the captured were spared from execution.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 182; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 149-150; Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp 92-97.</ref>\n* Soon after the Battle of the Colline Gate, Sulla had himself declared [[Dictator (Roman)|Dictator]], and now held supreme power over the Republic.<ref>Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp 102-103; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 149.</ref>\n* Marius tried to escape through the drains under Praeneste, but failed and committed suicide.

The cities of [[Aesernia]], [[Norba]] and [[Volterra]]e (Marian strongholds) were destroyed.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 153-153.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath 81 BC===\n* The survivors of the Marian cause were given refuge on [[Sicily]] by [[Marcus Perpenna Vento|Marcus Perpenna]], in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] by [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (died 81 BC)|Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and in Spain by [[Quintus Sertorius]]. \n* Sulla sent Pompey to Sicily with a large force (six legions, 120 warships and 800 transport ships). According to Plutarch, Perpenna fled and left Sicily to Pompey. Carbo was soon discovered and arrested by Pompey, who \"treated Carbo in his misfortunes with an unnatural insolence\", taking Carbo in fetters to a tribunal he presided over, examining him closely \"to the distress and vexation of the audience\", and finally, sentencing him to death.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp 28-29; Plutarch, ''The Life of Pompey'', 10.3.</ref>\n* Domitius Ahenobarbus held the [[Roman province of Africa]] (modern day Tunisia) for the Marians. While Pompey was still in Sicily, Sulla sent him orders to capture Africa as well. Pompey sailed to Utica (the province's Capital) and there [[Battle of Utica (81 BC)|he defeated Domitius]]. King [[Hiarbas (king)|Hiarbas]] of [[Numidia]], who was an ally of Domitius, was captured and executed and [[Hiempsal II]] restored to the throne of Numidia.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp 29-31; Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 12.</ref>\n* Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Quintus Sertorius. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men were expelled from the Iberian peninsula. Unfortunately for the Sullans, Sertorius would be back the following year (see: [[Sertorian War]]).<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 56; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 7.</ref>\n\n==Result==\nAs a result of this war, Sulla was installed as [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla#Dictatorship and Constitutional Reforms|dictator of Rome]], but many [[Italy|Italian]] towns and cities were heavily damaged: for instance, Sullan forces inflicted extensive damage upon [[Forl\u00ec]] (''Forum Livii''), which had allied with Marius. The reconstruction took decades.\n\nIn total control of Rome and most of Italy, Sulla instituted a series of [[proscription]]s (a program of executing those whom he perceived as [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]] and confiscating their property).\n\n<blockquote>\"Sulla immediately proscribed eighty persons without communicating with any magistrate. As this caused a general murmur, he let one day pass, and then proscribed two hundred and twenty more, and again on the third day as many. In an harangue to the people, he said, with reference to these measures, that he had proscribed all he could think of, and as to those who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them at some future time.\"<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sulla'', 31.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe proscriptions are widely perceived as a response to similar killings which Marius and Cinna had implemented while they controlled the Republic during Sulla's absence. Proscribing or outlawing every one of those whom he perceived to have acted against the best interests of the Republic while he was in the East, Sulla ordered some 1,500 nobles (''i.e.,'' senators and [[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]) executed, although it is estimated that as many as 9,000 people were killed.<ref>Cicero, [[Anthony Everitt]], p.41.</ref> The purge went on for several months. Helping or sheltering a proscribed person was punishable by death, while killing a proscribed person was rewarded. Family members of the proscribed were not excluded from punishment, and slaves were not excluded from rewards. As a result, \"husbands were butchered in the arms of their wives, sons in the arms of their mothers\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Roman Lives.'' Oxford University Press, 1999, translation by Robin Waterfield. p 210</ref> The majority of the proscribed had not been enemies of Sulla, but instead were killed for their property, which was confiscated and auctioned off. The proceeds from auctioned property more than made up for the cost of rewarding those who killed the proscribed, making Sulla even wealthier. Possibly to protect himself from future political retribution, Sulla had the sons and grandsons of the proscribed banned from running for political office, a restriction not removed for over 30 years.\n\nThe young [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], as Cinna's son-in-law, became one of Sulla's targets and fled the city. He was saved through the efforts of his relatives, many of whom were Sulla's supporters, but Sulla noted in his memoirs that he regretted sparing Caesar's life, because of the young man's notorious ambition. The historian [[Suetonius]] records that when agreeing to spare Caesar, Sulla warned those who were pleading his case that he would become a danger to them in the future, saying: \"In this Caesar there are many Mariuses.\"<ref>Suetonius, ''The Life of Julius Caesar'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''The Life of Caesar '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html 1]</ref>\n\nSulla, who opposed the [[Gracchi]]an ''popularis'' reforms, was an optimate; though his coming to the side of the traditional Senate originally could be described as more reactionary when dealing with the Tribunate and legislative bodies, while more visionary when reforming the court system, governorships and membership of the Senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\">Abbott, 104</ref> As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the Senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\"/> Sulla retained his earlier reforms, which required senatorial approval before any bill could be submitted to the [[Plebeian Council]] (the principal popular assembly), and which had also restored the older, more aristocratic [[Servian constitution|\"Servian\" organization]] to the [[Centuriate Assembly]] (assembly of soldiers).<ref name=\"Abbott, 103\">Abbott, 103</ref> Sulla, himself a patrician and thus ineligible for election to the office of [[tribune|Plebeian Tribune]], thoroughly disliked the office. As Sulla viewed the office, the Tribunate was especially dangerous and his intention was to not only deprive the Tribunate of power, but also of prestige. (Sulla himself had been officially deprived of his eastern command through the underhand activities of a tribune.) Over the previous three hundred years, the tribunes had directly challenged the patrician class and attempted to deprive it of power in favor of the plebeian class. Through Sulla's reforms to the Plebeian Council, tribunes lost the power to initiate legislation. Sulla then prohibited ex-tribunes from ever holding any other office, so ambitious individuals would no longer seek election to the Tribunate, since such an election would end their political career.<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\">Abbott, 105</ref> Finally, Sulla revoked the power of the tribunes to veto acts of the Senate, although he left intact the tribunes' power to protect individual Roman citizens.\n\nSulla then increased the number of magistrates elected in any given year,<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\"/> and required that all newly elected [[quaestor]]s gain automatic membership in the Senate. These two reforms were enacted primarily to allow Sulla to increase the size of the Senate from 300 to 600 senators. This also removed the need for the [[Roman Censor|censor]] to draw up a list of senators, since there were always more than enough former magistrates to fill the senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\"/> To further solidify the prestige and authority of the Senate, Sulla transferred the control of the courts from the equites, who had held control since the Gracchi reforms, to the senators. This, along with the increase in the number of courts, further added to the power that was already held by the senators.<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\"/> Sulla also codified, and thus established definitively, the ''[[cursus honorum]]'',<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\"/> which required an individual to reach a certain age and level of experience before running for any particular office. Sulla also wanted to reduce the risk that a future general might attempt to seize power, as he himself had done. To this end he reaffirmed the requirement that any individual wait for ten years before being re-elected to any office. Sulla then established a system where all consuls and praetors served in Rome during their year in office, and then commanded a provincial army as a governor for the year after they left office.<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\"/>\n\nFinally, in a demonstration of his absolute power, Sulla expanded the \"[[Pomerium]]\", the sacred boundary of Rome, unchanged since the time of the kings.<ref>LacusCurtius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Pomerium.html ''Pomerium'']</ref> Sulla's reforms both looked to the past (often re-passing former laws) and regulated for the future, particularly in his redefinition of [[Law of majestas|majestas]] (treason) laws and in his reform of the Senate.\n\nNear the end of 81 BC, Sulla, true to his traditionalist sentiments, resigned his dictatorship, disbanded his legions and re-established normal consular government. He stood for office (with [[Metellus Pius]]) and won election as consul for the following year, 80 BC. He dismissed his [[lictor]]s and walked unguarded in the Forum, offering to give account of his actions to any citizen.<ref>Plutarch, ''Sulla'', 34</ref><ref>Arthur Keaveney, ''Sulla: The Last Republican'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0Ykf4G40EMC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=sulla+dismissed+his+lictors&source=bl&ots=OfUOGC46Yx&sig=KPnuWvERxa_X2w_z2GgCd3U8r-M&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=Q0VOT4T8Lq_O4QS9gOn-Ag&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sulla%20dismissed%20his%20lictors&f=false p. 165]</ref> In a manner that the historian [[Suetonius]] thought arrogant, Julius Caesar would later mock Sulla for resigning the dictatorship.<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#77 77]. \"...&nbsp;No less arrogant were his public utterances, which Titus Ampius records: that the state was nothing, a mere name without body or form; that Sulla did not know his A.

It was fought between the Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] and his opponents, the Cinna-Marius faction (usually called the Marians after their leader [[Gaius Marius]]), in the years 83-81 BC. The war ended with a [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|decisive battle]] just outside of Rome itself. After the war the victorious Sulla made himself [[Dictator (Roman)|Dictator]] of the Republic.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prelude==\nSulla had achieved temporary control of Rome and Marius's exile to [[Africa Province|Africa]]  through [[Sulla's first civil war|his first march on Rome]], but departed soon afterwards to lead the [[First Mithridatic War]].  This departure allowed [[Gaius Marius]] and his son [[Gaius Marius the younger]] to return to Rome with an army and, with [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], to wrest control of Rome back from Sulla's supporter [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]] during Sulla's absence.  Based on the orders of Marius, some of his soldiers went through Rome killing the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius.  Their heads were exhibited in the Forum.  After five days, Cinna ordered his more disciplined troops to kill Marius's rampaging soldiers.  All told some 100 Roman nobles had been murdered.  Marius declared Sulla's reforms and laws invalid, officially exiled Sulla and had himself elected to Sulla's eastern command and himself and Cinna elected consuls for the year 86 BC.  Marius died a fortnight after and Cinna was left in sole control of Rome.\n\nHaving managed this achievement, the Marians sent out [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (suffect consul 86 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] with an army to relieve Sulla of his command in the east.  Flaccus had been given as second in command [[Gaius Flavius Fimbria]], an individual that history records had few virtues.  He was to eventually agitate against his commanding officer and incite the troops to murder Flaccus.\n\nIn the meantime, the two Roman armies camped next to each other and Sulla, not for the first time, encouraged his soldiers to spread dissension among Flaccus\u2019 army.  Many deserted to Sulla before Flaccus packed up and moved on north to threaten Mithridates\u2019 northern dominions.  In the meantime Sulla moved to intercept the new [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic]] army and end the war at [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla#Battle of Orchomenus|Orchomenus]].\n\n==Course==\nWith Mithridates defeated and Cinna now dead in a [[mutiny]], Sulla was determined to regain control of Rome.\n[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|Bust of Sulla in the [[Munich]] [[Glyptothek]]]]\n\n===Events of 83 BC===\n* In the spring of 83 BC Sulla landed his army in two divisions in southern Italy; one division at [[Brundisium]] another at [[Tarento|Tarentum]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 158; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 24.</ref> \n* At Tarentum Sulla made sacrifices to the gods.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 157-158.</ref>\n* As soon as he had set foot in Italy, the outlawed nobles and old Sullan supporters who had survived the Marian-Cinna regime flocked to his banner. The most prominent among them were [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (princeps senatus 86 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] (the [[princeps senatus]]) and [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 91 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]].

When Pompey and Sulla met Sulla addressed him as [[Imperator]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.159; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. pp 24-25; Tom Holland, Rubicon, p. 90; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 8.</ref>\n* [[Publius Cornelius Cethegus (senator)|Publius Cornelius Cethegus]], a firm supporter of Marius, now also joined the Sullan cause.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.160.</ref>\n* To check his enemies' unresisted advance, [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]] sent his newly elected puppet consuls, [[Gaius Norbanus]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC)|Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus]], both with armies, against Sulla. \n* When Sulla arrived in [[Campania]] he found the consul Norbanus blocking the road to [[Capua]]. Eager not to appear a war-hungry invader, Sulla sent deputations to Norbanus offering to negotiate, but these were rejected. Norbanus then moved to block Sulla's advance at [[Canusium]] and became the first to engage him in the [[Battle of Mount Tifata]]. Here Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on the Marians, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy. Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to [[Capua]]. Sulla pursued him, but was stopped by the Norbanus' consular partner, Scipio, who was encamped at Capua.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.162; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133.</ref>\n* Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle with his opponent's battle hardened army and welcomed Sulla's offer to negotiate. [[Quintus Sertorius]], one of Scipio's legates, did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were under way. Sertorius made a small detour and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to the Sullan faction. When Sulla complained about this breach of trust, Scipio sent back the hostages Sulla had given as a sigh of good faith. This behaviour by Scipio outraged Scipio's troops, who were already upset having to face Sulla's veterans. A deal was made between Scipio's soldiers and Sulla and they defected ''en masse'', further swelling his ranks. The Consul and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo. However, immediately after their release Scipio broke his promise and went straight to Carbo in Rome.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 162-165; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 133-134; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius'', pp 32-33.</ref>\n* Sulla then defeated Norbanus for a second time. Norbanus also escaped back to Rome and had Metellus Pius and all other senators marching with Sulla declared enemies of the state.\n* In Rome the elections for the consulship of 82 were held; [[Gaius Marius the Younger]] (the son of the great Gaius Marius) and Gaius Papirius Carbo (re-elected for the second time) were elected.<ref name=LTPH1>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 166; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 137.</ref>\n* At the end of the campaigning season of 83 BC, [[Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus|Marcus Lucullus]], one of Sulla's legates, defeated a numerically superior force (50 cohorts to his 16) at [[Fidentia]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 163; Plutarch, ''Life of Sulla'', 28.</ref>\n\n===Events of 82 BC===\n* The new consuls for the year 82 BC were Gaius Papirius Carbo, for his third term, and Gaius Marius the Younger, who was only 26\u201328 years old at the time.<ref name=LTPH1/>\n* In the respite from campaigning provided by Winter, the Marians set about replenishing their forces. [[Quintus Sertorius]] levied men in [[Etruria]], old veterans of Marius came out of retirement to fight under his son and the [[Samnites]] gathered their warriors in support of Carbo, hoping to destroy Sulla, the man who defeated them in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 165-167.</ref>\n* Meanwhile, Sulla had sent Crassus to recruit troops from among the [[Marsi]], Pompey to raise further legions in Picenum, and he also recruited soldiers from [[Calabria]] and [[Apulia]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 166-167; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25.</ref>\n* As the campaigning season opened, Sulla advanced along the [[Via Latina]] towards the capital and Metellus supported by Pompey led Sullan forces into northern Italy.

After an initial engagement Sulla decided to pitch camp. While Sulla's men were preparing the camp (digging a ditch, throwing up earthworks) Marius suddenly attacked. Sulla's veterans simply stuck their [[Pilum|pila]] into the ground to create a makeshift barricade and drew their swords. When they had organized their battle lines the Sullans counter-attacked. Marius' force were put on the defensive, their left began to waver and five cohorts of foot soldiers and two of horse deserted to Sulla. This cause a general collapse and Marius army scattered in rout. Marius lost 28,000 men (killed, captured, turned coat or fled) while Sulla claimed to have only lost 23 men.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 170-172; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 138-139.</ref> \n* Marius survived the [[Battle of Sacriporto|Battle of Scariportus]] and with 7,000 men he retreated to [[Praeneste]]. At Praeneste but the terrified townspeople shut the gates. Marius himself had to be hoisted in on a rope, while hundreds of Marians trapped between the walls and the Sullans were massacred. Sulla then left his lieutenant Lucretius Afella besieging Praeneste and moved on the now-undefended Rome.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 172; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 139.</ref>   \n*  Upon his defeat Marius sent word to the praetor Lucius Junius Brutus Damasippus in Rome, to kill any remaining Sullan sympathisers left before Sulla could take the city. Damasippus called a meeting of the Senate and there, in the Curia itself, the marked men were cut down by assassins.  Some, such as [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 94 BC)|Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus]] were killed on the senate steps as they tried to flee, and the [[Pontifex Maximus]], chief priest of Rome, [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]] was murdered in the [[Temple of Vesta]], the bodies of the murdered were then thrown into the [[Tiber]].<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 172-173; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 139-140; [[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 1.88.</ref>    \n* Meanwhile in the north, Metellus working in tandem with Pompey fought the consul Carbo and his legates [[Gaius Carrinas (general)|Gaius Carrinas]] and [[Gaius Marcius Censorinus (general)|Gaius Marcius Censorinus]].

This caused the Lucanians in Norbanus' army to contemplate to defect to Sulla. Their commander, a man called Albinovanus, hatched a plan with the Sullans to assassinate Norbanus and his senior officers (to show his good faith). At a feast Albinovanus had organized Norbanus' officers were murdered. Norbanus was unable to attend the feast and survived. After the assassination and the Lucanians defection, Ariminum went over to Sulla as well. Norbanus abandoned his army and fled from Italy.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 176-177; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 141-142.</ref>\n* Meanwhile, Sulla and his army had arrived at the siege of Praeneste. He blocked an attempt by Damasippus to reach Marius the Younger. After Damasippus failure Carbo lost heart and fled to Sicily. With their leader gone, the remainder of the Marian forces united for one final stand.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 177; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 142-143.</ref>\n* The Samnite general Pontius Telesinus and the Lucanian general Marcus Lamponius with a very large army of Samnites and Lucanians were trying to get to Praeneste to break the Sullan siege. Unfortunately for them, Sulla and his army put themselves in their path in a very defensible position. Damasippus, Censorinus and Carrinas then joined their men with the Samnites and Lucanians and together they decided to march on Rome. When Sulla found out he immediately followed them in pursuit.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 177-178; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 142-143; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 27.</ref>\n* Outside the walls of Rome, the last decisive battle of the civil war, the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]], took place; Sulla, after a very hard-fought and drawn-out battle, emerged victorious. It was afterwards estimated that ca. 50,000 men lost their lives on the battlefield that day.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 179-181; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 144-147; Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 92; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 27; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius'', p. 55; Plutarch, ''Life of Sulla'', 29; Velleius Paterculus, ''History'', 2.27.</ref>\n* Damasippus, Carrinas and Censorinus were brought to Sulla the following day and executed. Their heads and those of Lamponius and Telesinus were displayed to Marius at Praeneste.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 148.</ref>\n* Sulla subsequently entered Rome as a saviour (he had saved Rome from the Samnites, Rome's ancient enemy). A meeting of the Senate was convened in the [[Temple of Bellona (Rome)|Temple of Bellona]]; as Sulla was addressing the senators, the sound of terrified screams drifted in from the [[Campus Martius]]. Sulla calmed the senators by attributing the screams to 'some criminals that are receiving correction.' In reality, what the Senate had heard was the sound of 8,000 prisoners who had surrendered the previous day being executed on Sulla's orders; none of the captured were spared from execution.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 182; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 149-150; Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp 92-97.</ref>\n* Soon after the Battle of the Colline Gate, Sulla had himself declared [[Dictator (Roman)|Dictator]], and now held supreme power over the Republic.<ref>Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp 102-103; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 149.</ref>\n* Marius tried to escape through the drains under Praeneste, but failed and committed suicide. The town surrendered; most of the defenders were executed, but Sulla spared the lives of its Roman citizens.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 185; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 149.</ref> \n* Sulla and his lieutenants then campaigned all through Italy mopping up the remaining resistance. The cities of [[Aesernia]], [[Norba]] and [[Volterra]]e (Marian strongholds) were destroyed.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 153-153.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath 81 BC===\n* The survivors of the Marian cause were given refuge on [[Sicily]] by [[Marcus Perpenna Vento|Marcus Perpenna]], in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] by [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (died 81 BC)|Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and in Spain by [[Quintus Sertorius]]. \n* Sulla sent Pompey to Sicily with a large force (six legions, 120 warships and 800 transport ships). According to Plutarch, Perpenna fled and left Sicily to Pompey. Carbo was soon discovered and arrested by Pompey, who \"treated Carbo in his misfortunes with an unnatural insolence\", taking Carbo in fetters to a tribunal he presided over, examining him closely \"to the distress and vexation of the audience\", and finally, sentencing him to death.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp 28-29; Plutarch, ''The Life of Pompey'', 10.3.</ref>\n* Domitius Ahenobarbus held the [[Roman province of Africa]] (modern day Tunisia) for the Marians. While Pompey was still in Sicily, Sulla sent him orders to capture Africa as well. Pompey sailed to Utica (the province's Capital) and there [[Battle of Utica (81 BC)|he defeated Domitius]]. King [[Hiarbas (king)|Hiarbas]] of [[Numidia]], who was an ally of Domitius, was captured and executed and [[Hiempsal II]] restored to the throne of Numidia.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp 29-31; Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 12.</ref>\n* Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Quintus Sertorius. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men were expelled from the Iberian peninsula. Unfortunately for the Sullans, Sertorius would be back the following year (see: [[Sertorian War]]).<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 56; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 7.</ref>\n\n==Result==\nAs a result of this war, Sulla was installed as [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla#Dictatorship and Constitutional Reforms|dictator of Rome]], but many [[Italy|Italian]] towns and cities were heavily damaged: for instance, Sullan forces inflicted extensive damage upon [[Forl\u00ec]] (''Forum Livii''), which had allied with Marius. The reconstruction took decades.\n\nIn total control of Rome and most of Italy, Sulla instituted a series of [[proscription]]s (a program of executing those whom he perceived as [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]] and confiscating their property).\n\n<blockquote>\"Sulla immediately proscribed eighty persons without communicating with any magistrate. As this caused a general murmur, he let one day pass, and then proscribed two hundred and twenty more, and again on the third day as many. In an harangue to the people, he said, with reference to these measures, that he had proscribed all he could think of, and as to those who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them at some future time.\"<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sulla'', 31.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe proscriptions are widely perceived as a response to similar killings which Marius and Cinna had implemented while they controlled the Republic during Sulla's absence. Proscribing or outlawing every one of those whom he perceived to have acted against the best interests of the Republic while he was in the East, Sulla ordered some 1,500 nobles (''i.e.,'' senators and [[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]) executed, although it is estimated that as many as 9,000 people were killed.<ref>Cicero, [[Anthony Everitt]], p.41.</ref> The purge went on for several months. Helping or sheltering a proscribed person was punishable by death, while killing a proscribed person was rewarded. Family members of the proscribed were not excluded from punishment, and slaves were not excluded from rewards. As a result, \"husbands were butchered in the arms of their wives, sons in the arms of their mothers\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Roman Lives.'' Oxford University Press, 1999, translation by Robin Waterfield. p 210</ref> The majority of the proscribed had not been enemies of Sulla, but instead were killed for their property, which was confiscated and auctioned off. The proceeds from auctioned property more than made up for the cost of rewarding those who killed the proscribed, making Sulla even wealthier. Possibly to protect himself from future political retribution, Sulla had the sons and grandsons of the proscribed banned from running for political office, a restriction not removed for over 30 years.\n\nThe young [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], as Cinna's son-in-law, became one of Sulla's targets and fled the city. He was saved through the efforts of his relatives, many of whom were Sulla's supporters, but Sulla noted in his memoirs that he regretted sparing Caesar's life, because of the young man's notorious ambition. The historian [[Suetonius]] records that when agreeing to spare Caesar, Sulla warned those who were pleading his case that he would become a danger to them in the future, saying: \"In this Caesar there are many Mariuses.\"<ref>Suetonius, ''The Life of Julius Caesar'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''The Life of Caesar '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html 1]</ref>\n\nSulla, who opposed the [[Gracchi]]an ''popularis'' reforms, was an optimate; though his coming to the side of the traditional Senate originally could be described as more reactionary when dealing with the Tribunate and legislative bodies, while more visionary when reforming the court system, governorships and membership of the Senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\">Abbott, 104</ref> As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the Senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\"/> Sulla retained his earlier reforms, which required senatorial approval before any bill could be submitted to the [[Plebeian Council]] (the principal popular assembly), and which had also restored the older, more aristocratic [[Servian constitution|\"Servian\" organization]] to the [[Centuriate Assembly]] (assembly of soldiers).<ref name=\"Abbott, 103\">Abbott, 103</ref> Sulla, himself a patrician and thus ineligible for election to the office of [[tribune|Plebeian Tribune]], thoroughly disliked the office. As Sulla viewed the office, the Tribunate was especially dangerous and his intention was to not only deprive the Tribunate of power, but also of prestige. (Sulla himself had been officially deprived of his eastern command through the underhand activities of a tribune.) Over the previous three hundred years, the tribunes had directly challenged the patrician class and attempted to deprive it of power in favor of the plebeian class. Through Sulla's reforms to the Plebeian Council, tribunes lost the power to initiate legislation. Sulla then prohibited ex-tribunes from ever holding any other office, so ambitious individuals would no longer seek election to the Tribunate, since such an election would end their political career.<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\">Abbott, 105</ref> Finally, Sulla revoked the power of the tribunes to veto acts of the Senate, although he left intact the tribunes' power to protect individual Roman citizens.\n\nSulla then increased the number of magistrates elected in any given year,<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\"/> and required that all newly elected [[quaestor]]s gain automatic membership in the Senate. These two reforms were enacted primarily to allow Sulla to increase the size of the Senate from 300 to 600 senators. This also removed the need for the [[Roman Censor|censor]] to draw up a list of senators, since there were always more than enough former magistrates to fill the senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 104\"/> To further solidify the prestige and authority of the Senate, Sulla transferred the control of the courts from the equites, who had held control since the Gracchi reforms, to the senators. This, along with the increase in the number of courts, further added to the power that was already held by the senators.<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\"/> Sulla also codified, and thus established definitively, the ''[[cursus honorum]]'',<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\"/> which required an individual to reach a certain age and level of experience before running for any particular office. Sulla also wanted to reduce the risk that a future general might attempt to seize power, as he himself had done. To this end he reaffirmed the requirement that any individual wait for ten years before being re-elected to any office. Sulla then established a system where all consuls and praetors served in Rome during their year in office, and then commanded a provincial army as a governor for the year after they left office.<ref name=\"Abbott, 105\"/>\n\nFinally, in a demonstration of his absolute power, Sulla expanded the \"[[Pomerium]]\", the sacred boundary of Rome, unchanged since the time of the kings.<ref>LacusCurtius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Pomerium.html ''Pomerium'']</ref> Sulla's reforms both looked to the past (often re-passing former laws) and regulated for the future, particularly in his redefinition of [[Law of majestas|majestas]] (treason) laws and in his reform of the Senate.\n\nNear the end of 81 BC, Sulla, true to his traditionalist sentiments, resigned his dictatorship, disbanded his legions and re-established normal consular government. He stood for office (with [[Metellus Pius]]) and won election as consul for the following year, 80 BC. He dismissed his [[lictor]]s and walked unguarded in the Forum, offering to give account of his actions to any citizen.<ref>Plutarch, ''Sulla'', 34</ref><ref>Arthur Keaveney, ''Sulla: The Last Republican'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0Ykf4G40EMC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=sulla+dismissed+his+lictors&source=bl&ots=OfUOGC46Yx&sig=KPnuWvERxa_X2w_z2GgCd3U8r-M&hl=bg&sa=X&ei=Q0VOT4T8Lq_O4QS9gOn-Ag&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sulla%20dismissed%20his%20lictors&f=false p. 165]</ref> In a manner that the historian [[Suetonius]] thought arrogant, Julius Caesar would later mock Sulla for resigning the dictatorship.<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#77 77]. \"...&nbsp;No less arrogant were his public utterances, which Titus Ampius records: that the state was nothing, a mere name without body or form; that Sulla did not know his A. B. C. when he laid down his dictatorship; that men ought now to be more circumspect in addressing him, and to regard his word as law. So far did he go in his presumption, that when a soothsayer once reported direful inwards [sic] without a heart, he said: \"They will be more favourable when I wish it; it should not be regarded as a portent, if a beast has no heart&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last=Brunt |year=1971 |first=P.A. |title=Italian Manpower 225 B.C.\u2013A.D. 14 |publisher=Clarendon Press |place=Oxford |isbn=0-19-814283-8 |authorlink=Peter Brunt |ref=harv}}\n\n{{Ancient Roman Wars}}\n\n[[Category:82 BC]]\n[[Category:Roman Republican civil wars]]\n[[Category:Sulla's second civil war| ]]\n[[Category:1st century BC in Italy]]\n[[Category:80s BC conflicts]]\n[[Category:83 BC]]\n[[Category:1st century BC in the Roman Republic]]\n", "name_user": "Aforst1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla%27s_second_civil_war"}

These four groups are all [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], occurring mostly as [[symbiosis|symbiote]]s of animals.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA number of parabasalids and oxymonads are found in [[termite]] [[guts]], and play an important role in breaking down the [[cellulose]] found in [[wood]].  Some other metamonads are [[Parasitism|parasites]].\n\nThese flagellates are unusual in lacking [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].  Originally they were considered among the most primitive [[eukaryote]]s, diverging from the others before mitochondria appeared.  However, they are now known to have lost mitochondria secondarily, and retain both organelles and nuclear genes derived from them.  Mitochondrial relics include [[hydrogenosome]]s, which produce [[hydrogen]], and small structures called [[mitosome]]s.\n\nIt now appears the Metamonada are, together with [[Malawimonas]], sister clades of the [[Unikont|Podiata]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=Thomas|last2=Chao|first2=Ema E.|last3=Lewis|first3=Rhodri|date=2016-06-01|title=187-gene phylogeny of protozoan phylum Amoebozoa reveals a new class (Cutosea) of deep-branching, ultrastructurally unique, enveloped marine Lobosa and clarifies amoeba evolution|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=99|pages=275\u2013296|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2016.03.023|pmid=27001604|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAll of these groups are united by having [[flagellum|flagella]] or basal bodies in characteristic groups of four, which are often associated with the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], forming a structure called a ''karyomastigont''.  In addition, the genera ''Carpediemonas'' and ''Trimastix'' are now known to be close relatives of the retortamonad-diplomonad line and the oxymonads, respectively.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year.

system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].
