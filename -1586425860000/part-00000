His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker.

The album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and [[Johnny Rotten]]'s sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game-changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the most important albums of all time.\n\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were controversial, having sworn on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"[[bollocks]]\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead.\n\nDue in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the [[UK Album Charts]]. It went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for over a year, spending 60 weeks in the top 25.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15960/sex-pistols/ |title=SEX PISTOLS |website=Official Charts}}</ref> It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2012.\n\n== Recording ==\nClose to completing a deal with [[A&M Records]], in March 1977 the Sex Pistols entered [[Wessex Sound Studios]] to record with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] and engineer [[Bill Price (record producer)|Bill Price]]. New bassist [[Sid Vicious]] played on the track \"[[Bodies (Sex Pistols song)|Bodies]]\",{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}} but his performing skills were not considered fit to record the full album, so the band asked manager [[Malcolm McLaren]] to convince previous bassist [[Glen Matlock]] to perform the instrument for the sessions.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=64}} Matlock agreed on the condition that he was paid beforehand. When payment was not received, he declined to attend. As a result, Thomas asked guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] to play bass so work could begin on the basic tracks. Jones' playing was so satisfactory that Thomas had him play the bass tracks for all the remaining songs recorded during the sessions.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=66}}\n\nFour tracks\u2014writer [[Clinton Heylin]] suspected they were \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\" (Thomas stated he and Price \"gave up\" trying to use Vicious' bass track{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}}), \"[[Pretty Vacant]]\", \"[[E.M.I. (Sex Pistols song)|E.M.I.]]\" and possibly \"Did You No Wrong\"\u2014were recorded during the two days at Wessex, with \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Pretty Vacant\" receiving vocal tracking from [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] and final mixing during the period.{{fact|date=January 2019}} As a result of these sessions, Thomas and Price began work in earnest on what would become the Sex Pistols' full-length album.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=67}} Four days after recording was completed, the Sex Pistols signed with A&M, yet on 16 March the label terminated the contract, and several thousand pressed copies of the forthcoming \"God Save the Queen\" single were destroyed.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=70}}\n\nDespite being dropped by A&M, McLaren instructed the Sex Pistols to continue work on the album. While McLaren pondered whether or not to sign the offer presented by [[Virgin Records]], he signed a French deal for the group with [[Barclay Records]] in early May 1977. At the same time, the group resumed work with Thomas and Price.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=72}} Thomas temporarily departed the session partway through (a timeframe Heylin places as sometime in late April and early May), leaving Price to produce what Thomas estimated as five songs. Heylin narrowed down the potential ''Bollocks'' tracks Price may have produced to \"Liar\", \"New York\", \"No Feelings\", \"Problems\", \"Seventeen\" and \"Submission\", in addition to the non-album track \"Satellite\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=75,77}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Sex Pistols had been rejected by labels including CBS, Decca, Pye and Polydor, leaving only Virgin's offer. McLaren still hoped to sign with a major label, and posited issuing a one-off single with Virgin to increase the band's appeal to the larger record companies. Virgin owner [[Richard Branson]] refused, so on 18 May the Sex Pistols finally signed with Virgin. Two weeks later, the label rush-released \"God Save the Queen\" as a single.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=78}} During promotion of the single, Rotten stated that work on the album was ongoing, and, obscuring Jones's assumption of bass duties, insisted that the bass performances on the in-progress album were split between Matlock \"on the Chris Thomas tracks\" and Vicious.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=81}}\n\nThe band returned to the studio with Thomas and Price on 18 June to record \"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\", the first song they had written without Matlock. That night after visiting a nearby pub, Rotten, Thomas and Price were attacked by a group of men, and the incident made newspaper headlines the following Tuesday.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=81-82}} That month an eleven-track preview of the album began circulating, first reviewed in the fanzine ''48 Thrills''. At this point, Rotten maintained that the forthcoming album would include no cover songs, and none of the Sex Pistols' previously released singles bar \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", which was out of print. With \"Pretty Vacant\"'s release as a single, it was due to be replaced on the track list.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=87-90}} The Sex Pistols returned to Wessex once more that August to record a new song, \"Bodies\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=92,131}} It was on this track Vicious recorded his only bass part for the album.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=92}} \"Bodies\" contained a second bass track played by Steve Jones, with the final version of the song \"leaving Sid's down low.\"{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}}\n\nThe time spent in the studio recording the album was, for Steve Jones, the \"best part of being in the Pistols.\"{{sfn|Jones|2017}} Jones spent many hours doing guitar overdubs with producer Chris Thomas and\u2014repudiating punk's occasional embrace of musical sloppiness\u2014has stated that both he and drummer Paul Cook \"weren't just having a laugh\" and were \"really dedicated in the studio\". Also during this time period, bassist [[Sid Vicious]] stumbled into the same recording room as rock band [[Queen(band)|Queen]]. He had a weak insult aimed at lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]], saying \"Have you brought ballet to the masses, yet?\" Completely unbothered by this, Freddie got up and said \"Aren't you Simon Ferocious or something? What're you gonna to do about it?\", took him by the collar and threw him out of the room. Later, Queen's producer had a word with the Pistols' engineer over an interruption by an awestruck [[Johnny Rotten]], saying, \"One of the band members just crawled on all fours across our studio up to the side of the piano, said, 'Hello Freddie,' and left on all fours. Could you make sure he doesn't do it again?\"<ref name=Purvis/>\n\n== Release ==\nWith the completion of \"Bodies\", the time came to finalise the album's track list. Though [[Jon Savage]] wrote there were three versions of each track available, Heylin states that alternative versions for only five tracks (\"[[E.M.I. (Sex Pistols song)|E.M.I.]],\" \"No Feelings\", \"Seventeen\" and \"Submission\", plus an \"album\" mix of \"Satellite\") existed.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=94}} It was not until 20 September that the track list was finalised, which Heylin said \"suggests just how bogged down by the process they had become\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=97}} Richard Branson spent the night deciding the track list and which versions to use, and included all the hits on the record, despite the objections of the band, McLaren's management company Glitterbest and most of Virgin.{{sfn|Savage|2001|p=409}} Due to the album's long completion time, the Sex Pistols and McLaren decided to release \"Holidays in the Sun\" backed with \"Satellite\" as the band's fourth single. \"Holidays in the Sun\" was not as successful as past singles\u2014it charted at number eight and dropped out of the top 20 after four weeks\u2014which Heylin attributed to the group's announcement that their album would be released on 4 November and that the single would be included on the LP, despite previous statements to the contrary. In an attempt to stem criticism over the decision to include all four previously released Sex Pistols singles on the forthcoming LP, Virgin indicated the possibility of an \"alternative album\" being issued simultaneously, featuring a new title and two new songs replacing \"two of the former hit singles\". A label spokesman stated, \"We've put the singles on the LP because most people wanted it that way. But the alternative set would enable us to overcome the multiple stores' ban\". A ten-song test pressing was made, though no new cuts were included, with \"Satellite\" and \"Submission\" being added as bonus tracks.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe Sex Pistols' contract with Virgin stated that its music would be distributed by Virgin in the United States provided Branson matched any competing offers McLaren received. However, McLaren wanted to negotiate separate deals in every territory, regardless of what the contract stipulated, which angered Branson, as the clause for American distribution was an important one he had fought for. Branson knew he had been outmanoeuvred by McLaren, for he could not sue to enforce the contract or else be perceived as acting like EMI or A&M. Competition for the band in the United States narrowed down to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], [[Arista Records|Arista]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[Casablanca Records]], with Warner Bros. signing the band on 10 October for \u00a322,000.{{sfn|Savage|2001|p=408}}\n\nBefore Virgin could release ''Never Mind the Bollocks'', Branson discovered that two other Sex Pistols albums were competing with his label's.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=98}} In October, a bootleg named ''[[Spunk (album)|Spunk]]'' featuring high-quality recordings of Sex Pistols demos and recording sessions with [[Dave Goodman (record producer)|Dave Goodman]] was released on a label called Blank. Among the rumours of who was behind the release of the tapes included Goodman, Glen Matlock and McLaren, who has always considered Goodman's versions to be a more accurate representation of the band.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=99}} Meanwhile, the French pressing of ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' on Barclay had added \"Submission\" to the slated 11-song track list, and was due for release a week before Virgin's edition. As McLaren's separate deal with Barclay meant that the French release could not be halted and given the Virgin head was aware of how easy it was for import records to arrive in Britain, Branson rushed production of ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' to ensure it would come out a week earlier than intended. Nevertheless, the Barclay version was already available in the UK at the time Virgin had its version ready. Ten thousand copies of Virgin's pressing erroneously only listed 11 tracks on the sleeve yet contained 12 on the actual record.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=98}}\n\nEven with the availability of ''Spunk'', the release of ''Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols'' was eagerly awaited in the United Kingdom. With advance orders of 125,000 copies, ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' debuted at number one on the [[UK Album Charts]] the week after its release.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=105}} A ban of the album enacted by major retailers resulted in the record selling well through independent vendors instead.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=109}}\n\n== Title, packaging and obscenity case ==\nThe album was originally going to be titled ''God Save Sex Pistols''. [[Jamie Reid]]'s cover concept refrained from including a picture of the group and instead was dayglo red and yellow in colour with cutout lettering and a finish resembling crude screen-prints. The album's title changed in mid-1977, based on a phrase supplied by Steve Jones.{{sfn|Savage|2001|p=409}} Jones said he picked up the phrase \"Never mind the bollocks\" from two fans who would always say it to one another. Johnny Rotten explained its meaning as a working-class expression to \"stop talking rubbish\".{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album was subject to what Heylin described as \"blatant acts of censorship exercised by media and retail outlets alike\". London police visited the city's Virgin record store branches and told them they faced prosecution for indecency as stipulated by the 1899 Indecent Advertisements Act if they continued to display posters of the album cover in their windows. The displays were either toned down or removed. However, on 9 November 1977 the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' announced on its front-page headline \"Police Move in on Punk Disc Shops\", and reported how a Virgin Records shop manager in Nottingham was arrested for displaying the record after being warned to cover up the word \"[[bollocks]]\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=112}} Chris Seale, the shop's manager, \"it would appear, willingly set himself up as a target, possibly at Branson's behest\", according to Heylin, who noted that he had been visited by the police on four separate occasions and resumed displaying copies of the record in the store windows after they had left on each occasion. After Seale's arrest, Branson announced that he would cover the manager's legal costs and hired [[Queen's Counsel]] [[John Mortimer]] as defence. Meanwhile, advertisements for ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' appearing in music papers attempted to politicise the issue, showing newspaper headlines about Sex Pistols controversies that were underlined with the message \"THE ALBUM WILL LAST. THE SLEEVE MAY NOT.\"{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=113}}\n\nThe obscenity case was heard at [[Nottingham Magistrates' Court]] on 24 November.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=113}} Mortimer presented the case as a matter of police discrimination. During his cross-examination of the arresting officer, he asked why the newspapers ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''Evening Standard'' (which had referred to the album's name) had not been charged under the same act. When the overseeing magistrate inquired about his line of questioning, Mortimer stated that a [[double standard]] was apparently at play, and that \"bollocks\" was only considered obscene when it appeared on the cover of a Sex Pistols album. The prosecutor conducted his cross-examination \"as if the album itself, and not its lurid visage, was on trial for indecency\", according to Heylin.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=114}} Mortimer produced an expert witness, Professor James Kinsley,<ref>{{cite web|title=University helps Virgin out of a Branson pickle|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]|year=2012|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/English/News/University-helps-Virgin-out-of-a-Branson-pickle.aspx|accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref> Head of the School of English at the University of Nottingham, who argued that the word \"bollocks\" was not obscene, and was actually a legitimate Old English term formerly used to refer to a priest,<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_branson_s_life_at_30_000_feet.html Richard Branson: Life at 30,000 feet] ''[[TED (conference)|TED]]'' interview (Mar 2007, posted in Oct 2007), in which [[Richard Branson]] discusses the ''Never mind the Bollocks...'' court case (at 18:30 minutes).

Lawyer [[Geoffrey Robertson]], who appeared with Mortimer, recalled the professor saying that early English translations of the Bible used \"bollocks\" to refer to testicles, this being replaced by the word \"stones\" in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, at which point Rotten handed Robertson a note saying, \"Don't worry.

These ideas must be dealt with, and can be expected to affect the way fans think and behave.

He said, of the album's opening with \"Holidays in the Sun\", \"That is extremely provocative, what we can only assume is [[Jackboot|jackboots]]\", which he followed by saying, \"As soon as that starts, everything that has gone on before is now deemed fucking irrelevant, as soon as he (John Lydon) starts anti singing.\" He then said of \"Pretty Vacant\", \"One of the 1st things you learn when you pick up the electric guitar is that riff.\" He then further commented, \"I made 10 albums and in my mind they don't match up to that, and I'm an arrogant bastard.

The set included a 7-inch insert of \"Submission\" and poster, as originally released on 28 October 1977. Virgin also reissued the group's four singles, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", \"God Save the Queen\", \"Pretty Vacant\" and \"Holidays in the Sun\", on 7-inch vinyl, before the album reissue.\n\nIn the US and Canada, these re-releases were handled by Warner Bros., which originally released the album in North America and (as of 2017) still owns the regional copyright to the album.\n\nA four-disc boxed set reissue occurred on 24 September 2012. The set includes the original album, which for the first time was digitally remastered from the original master tapes, on disc one. The sound quality of this remaster is thus a significant improvement over all other reissues.  The remastering process was overseen by original producer Chris Thomas. The second disc comprises all but one of the band's officially released B-sides (omitting \"I Wanna Be Me\"), which were also remastered. This disc also includes outtakes and demos from the recording sessions for 'NMTB', most notably the studio demo of \"[[Belsen Was A Gas]]\", which had been recently rediscovered and was previously thought lost forever. The third disc contains two live recordings from 1977 (Including the previously unreleased complete [[soundboard recording]] of their performance at the Happy House in Stockholm, Sweden on 28 June 1977). The fourth and final disc is a DVD of live and studio videos \u2013 as well as audio interviews from 1977. Also included is a full size 100 page hard cover, full color coffee table book which contains rare pictures, articles, and interviews that provides a timelime of the band throughout 1977. Additionally the set includes a full size replica \"subway\" promotional 'NMTB' poster, replicas of original promo stickers, a re-print of John Lydon's original hand-written lyrics to \"God Save The Queen\", and a replica of the original [[A&M Records|A&M]] copy of the \"God Save the Queen\" single. This UMG box set (SEXPISSBOX1977) and the [[Sex Pistols Box Set|2002 Virgin box set]] (SEXBOX1) together contain almost the entire Sex Pistols studio/demo sessions \u2013 omitting only three of the June 1976 Dave Goodman demos which can be found on the 2006 officially released remaster of the \"Spunk\" bootleg.<ref>{{cite web

The album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and [[Johnny Rotten]]'s sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game-changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the most important albums of all time.\n\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were controversial, having sworn on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"[[bollocks]]\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead.\n\nDue in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the [[UK Album Charts]]. It went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for over a year, spending 60 weeks in the top 25.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15960/sex-pistols/ |title=SEX PISTOLS |website=Official Charts}}</ref> It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2012.\n\n== Recording ==\nClose to completing a deal with [[A&M Records]], in March 1977 the Sex Pistols entered [[Wessex Sound Studios]] to record with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] and engineer [[Bill Price (record producer)|Bill Price]]. New bassist [[Sid Vicious]] played on the track \"[[Bodies (Sex Pistols song)|Bodies]]\",{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}} but his performing skills were not considered fit to record the full album, so the band asked manager [[Malcolm McLaren]] to convince previous bassist [[Glen Matlock]] to perform the instrument for the sessions.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=64}} Matlock agreed on the condition that he was paid beforehand. When payment was not received, he declined to attend. As a result, Thomas asked guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] to play bass so work could begin on the basic tracks. Jones' playing was so satisfactory that Thomas had him play the bass tracks for all the remaining songs recorded during the sessions.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=66}}\n\nFour tracks\u2014writer [[Clinton Heylin]] suspected they were \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\" (Thomas stated he and Price \"gave up\" trying to use Vicious' bass track{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}}), \"[[Pretty Vacant]]\", \"[[E.M.I. (Sex Pistols song)|E.M.I.]]\" and possibly \"Did You No Wrong\"\u2014were recorded during the two days at Wessex, with \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Pretty Vacant\" receiving vocal tracking from [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] and final mixing during the period.{{fact|date=January 2019}} As a result of these sessions, Thomas and Price began work in earnest on what would become the Sex Pistols' full-length album.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=67}} Four days after recording was completed, the Sex Pistols signed with A&M, yet on 16 March the label terminated the contract, and several thousand pressed copies of the forthcoming \"God Save the Queen\" single were destroyed.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=70}}\n\nDespite being dropped by A&M, McLaren instructed the Sex Pistols to continue work on the album. While McLaren pondered whether or not to sign the offer presented by [[Virgin Records]], he signed a French deal for the group with [[Barclay Records]] in early May 1977. At the same time, the group resumed work with Thomas and Price.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=72}} Thomas temporarily departed the session partway through (a timeframe Heylin places as sometime in late April and early May), leaving Price to produce what Thomas estimated as five songs. Heylin narrowed down the potential ''Bollocks'' tracks Price may have produced to \"Liar\", \"New York\", \"No Feelings\", \"Problems\", \"Seventeen\" and \"Submission\", in addition to the non-album track \"Satellite\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=75,77}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Sex Pistols had been rejected by labels including CBS, Decca, Pye and Polydor, leaving only Virgin's offer. McLaren still hoped to sign with a major label, and posited issuing a one-off single with Virgin to increase the band's appeal to the larger record companies. Virgin owner [[Richard Branson]] refused, so on 18 May the Sex Pistols finally signed with Virgin. Two weeks later, the label rush-released \"God Save the Queen\" as a single.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=78}} During promotion of the single, Rotten stated that work on the album was ongoing, and, obscuring Jones's assumption of bass duties, insisted that the bass performances on the in-progress album were split between Matlock \"on the Chris Thomas tracks\" and Vicious.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=81}}\n\nThe band returned to the studio with Thomas and Price on 18 June to record \"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\", the first song they had written without Matlock. That night after visiting a nearby pub, Rotten, Thomas and Price were attacked by a group of men, and the incident made newspaper headlines the following Tuesday.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=81-82}} That month an eleven-track preview of the album began circulating, first reviewed in the fanzine ''48 Thrills''. At this point, Rotten maintained that the forthcoming album would include no cover songs, and none of the Sex Pistols' previously released singles bar \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", which was out of print. With \"Pretty Vacant\"'s release as a single, it was due to be replaced on the track list.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=87-90}} The Sex Pistols returned to Wessex once more that August to record a new song, \"Bodies\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=92,131}} It was on this track Vicious recorded his only bass part for the album.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=92}} \"Bodies\" contained a second bass track played by Steve Jones, with the final version of the song \"leaving Sid's down low.\"{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}}\n\nThe time spent in the studio recording the album was, for Steve Jones, the \"best part of being in the Pistols.\"{{sfn|Jones|2017}} Jones spent many hours doing guitar overdubs with producer Chris Thomas and\u2014repudiating punk's occasional embrace of musical sloppiness\u2014has stated that both he and drummer Paul Cook \"weren't just having a laugh\" and were \"really dedicated in the studio\". Also during this time period, bassist [[Sid Vicious]] stumbled into the same recording room as rock band [[Queen(band)|Queen]]. He had a weak insult aimed at lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]], saying \"Have you brought ballet to the masses, yet?\" Completely unbothered by this, Freddie got up and said \"Aren't you Simon Ferocious or something? What're you gonna to do about it?\", took him by the collar and threw him out of the room. Later, Queen's producer had a word with the Pistols' engineer over an interruption by an awestruck [[Johnny Rotten]], saying, \"One of the band members just crawled on all fours across our studio up to the side of the piano, said, 'Hello Freddie,' and left on all fours. Could you make sure he doesn't do it again?\"<ref name=Purvis/>\n\n== Release ==\nWith the completion of \"Bodies\", the time came to finalise the album's track list. Though [[Jon Savage]] wrote there were three versions of each track available, Heylin states that alternative versions for only five tracks (\"[[E.M.I. (Sex Pistols song)|E.M.I.]],\" \"No Feelings\", \"Seventeen\" and \"Submission\", plus an \"album\" mix of \"Satellite\") existed.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=94}} It was not until 20 September that the track list was finalised, which Heylin said \"suggests just how bogged down by the process they had become\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=97}} Richard Branson spent the night deciding the track list and which versions to use, and included all the hits on the record, despite the objections of the band, McLaren's management company Glitterbest and most of Virgin.{{sfn|Savage|2001|p=409}} Due to the album's long completion time, the Sex Pistols and McLaren decided to release \"Holidays in the Sun\" backed with \"Satellite\" as the band's fourth single. \"Holidays in the Sun\" was not as successful as past singles\u2014it charted at number eight and dropped out of the top 20 after four weeks\u2014which Heylin attributed to the group's announcement that their album would be released on 4 November and that the single would be included on the LP, despite previous statements to the contrary. In an attempt to stem criticism over the decision to include all four previously released Sex Pistols singles on the forthcoming LP, Virgin indicated the possibility of an \"alternative album\" being issued simultaneously, featuring a new title and two new songs replacing \"two of the former hit singles\". A label spokesman stated, \"We've put the singles on the LP because most people wanted it that way. But the alternative set would enable us to overcome the multiple stores' ban\". A ten-song test pressing was made, though no new cuts were included, with \"Satellite\" and \"Submission\" being added as bonus tracks.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe Sex Pistols' contract with Virgin stated that its music would be distributed by Virgin in the United States provided Branson matched any competing offers McLaren received. However, McLaren wanted to negotiate separate deals in every territory, regardless of what the contract stipulated, which angered Branson, as the clause for American distribution was an important one he had fought for. Branson knew he had been outmanoeuvred by McLaren, for he could not sue to enforce the contract or else be perceived as acting like EMI or A&M. Competition for the band in the United States narrowed down to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], [[Arista Records|Arista]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[Casablanca Records]], with Warner Bros. signing the band on 10 October for \u00a322,000.{{sfn|Savage|2001|p=408}}\n\nBefore Virgin could release ''Never Mind the Bollocks'', Branson discovered that two other Sex Pistols albums were competing with his label's.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=98}} In October, a bootleg named ''[[Spunk (album)|Spunk]]'' featuring high-quality recordings of Sex Pistols demos and recording sessions with [[Dave Goodman (record producer)|Dave Goodman]] was released on a label called Blank. Among the rumours of who was behind the release of the tapes included Goodman, Glen Matlock and McLaren, who has always considered Goodman's versions to be a more accurate representation of the band.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=99}} Meanwhile, the French pressing of ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' on Barclay had added \"Submission\" to the slated 11-song track list, and was due for release a week before Virgin's edition. As McLaren's separate deal with Barclay meant that the French release could not be halted and given the Virgin head was aware of how easy it was for import records to arrive in Britain, Branson rushed production of ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' to ensure it would come out a week earlier than intended. Nevertheless, the Barclay version was already available in the UK at the time Virgin had its version ready. Ten thousand copies of Virgin's pressing erroneously only listed 11 tracks on the sleeve yet contained 12 on the actual record.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=98}}\n\nEven with the availability of ''Spunk'', the release of ''Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols'' was eagerly awaited in the United Kingdom. With advance orders of 125,000 copies, ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' debuted at number one on the [[UK Album Charts]] the week after its release.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=105}} A ban of the album enacted by major retailers resulted in the record selling well through independent vendors instead.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=109}}\n\n== Title, packaging and obscenity case ==\nThe album was originally going to be titled ''God Save Sex Pistols''. [[Jamie Reid]]'s cover concept refrained from including a picture of the group and instead was dayglo red and yellow in colour with cutout lettering and a finish resembling crude screen-prints. The album's title changed in mid-1977, based on a phrase supplied by Steve Jones.{{sfn|Savage|2001|p=409}} Jones said he picked up the phrase \"Never mind the bollocks\" from two fans who would always say it to one another. Johnny Rotten explained its meaning as a working-class expression to \"stop talking rubbish\".{{sfn|''Classic Albums''|2002}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album was subject to what Heylin described as \"blatant acts of censorship exercised by media and retail outlets alike\". London police visited the city's Virgin record store branches and told them they faced prosecution for indecency as stipulated by the 1899 Indecent Advertisements Act if they continued to display posters of the album cover in their windows. The displays were either toned down or removed. However, on 9 November 1977 the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' announced on its front-page headline \"Police Move in on Punk Disc Shops\", and reported how a Virgin Records shop manager in Nottingham was arrested for displaying the record after being warned to cover up the word \"[[bollocks]]\".{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=112}} Chris Seale, the shop's manager, \"it would appear, willingly set himself up as a target, possibly at Branson's behest\", according to Heylin, who noted that he had been visited by the police on four separate occasions and resumed displaying copies of the record in the store windows after they had left on each occasion. After Seale's arrest, Branson announced that he would cover the manager's legal costs and hired [[Queen's Counsel]] [[John Mortimer]] as defence. Meanwhile, advertisements for ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' appearing in music papers attempted to politicise the issue, showing newspaper headlines about Sex Pistols controversies that were underlined with the message \"THE ALBUM WILL LAST. THE SLEEVE MAY NOT.\"{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=113}}\n\nThe obscenity case was heard at [[Nottingham Magistrates' Court]] on 24 November.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=113}} Mortimer presented the case as a matter of police discrimination. During his cross-examination of the arresting officer, he asked why the newspapers ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''Evening Standard'' (which had referred to the album's name) had not been charged under the same act. When the overseeing magistrate inquired about his line of questioning, Mortimer stated that a [[double standard]] was apparently at play, and that \"bollocks\" was only considered obscene when it appeared on the cover of a Sex Pistols album. The prosecutor conducted his cross-examination \"as if the album itself, and not its lurid visage, was on trial for indecency\", according to Heylin.{{sfn|Heylin|1998|p=114}} Mortimer produced an expert witness, Professor James Kinsley,<ref>{{cite web|title=University helps Virgin out of a Branson pickle|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]|year=2012|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/English/News/University-helps-Virgin-out-of-a-Branson-pickle.aspx|accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref> Head of the School of English at the University of Nottingham, who argued that the word \"bollocks\" was not obscene, and was actually a legitimate Old English term formerly used to refer to a priest,<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_branson_s_life_at_30_000_feet.html Richard Branson: Life at 30,000 feet] ''[[TED (conference)|TED]]'' interview (Mar 2007, posted in Oct 2007), in which [[Richard Branson]] discusses the ''Never mind the Bollocks...'' court case (at 18:30 minutes).

These ideas must be dealt with, and can be expected to affect the way fans think and behave.

The set included a 7-inch insert of \"Submission\" and poster, as originally released on 28 October 1977. Virgin also reissued the group's four singles, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", \"God Save the Queen\", \"Pretty Vacant\" and \"Holidays in the Sun\", on 7-inch vinyl, before the album reissue.\n\nIn the US and Canada, these re-releases were handled by Warner Bros., which originally released the album in North America and (as of 2017) still owns the regional copyright to the album.\n\nA four-disc boxed set reissue occurred on 24 September 2012. The set includes the original album, which for the first time was digitally remastered from the original master tapes, on disc one. The sound quality of this remaster is thus a significant improvement over all other reissues.  The remastering process was overseen by original producer Chris Thomas. The second disc comprises all but one of the band's officially released B-sides (omitting \"I Wanna Be Me\"), which were also remastered. This disc also includes outtakes and demos from the recording sessions for 'NMTB', most notably the studio demo of \"[[Belsen Was A Gas]]\", which had been recently rediscovered and was previously thought lost forever. The third disc contains two live recordings from 1977 (Including the previously unreleased complete [[soundboard recording]] of their performance at the Happy House in Stockholm, Sweden on 28 June 1977). The fourth and final disc is a DVD of live and studio videos \u2013 as well as audio interviews from 1977. Also included is a full size 100 page hard cover, full color coffee table book which contains rare pictures, articles, and interviews that provides a timelime of the band throughout 1977. Additionally the set includes a full size replica \"subway\" promotional 'NMTB' poster, replicas of original promo stickers, a re-print of John Lydon's original hand-written lyrics to \"God Save The Queen\", and a replica of the original [[A&M Records|A&M]] copy of the \"God Save the Queen\" single. This UMG box set (SEXPISSBOX1977) and the [[Sex Pistols Box Set|2002 Virgin box set]] (SEXBOX1) together contain almost the entire Sex Pistols studio/demo sessions \u2013 omitting only three of the June 1976 Dave Goodman demos which can be found on the 2006 officially released remaster of the \"Spunk\" bootleg.<ref>{{cite web

He never takes a personal approach, instead choosing to film his subjects from a distance with his video camera. Aloys loathes personal contact with others, ignoring various residents of his apartment, and especially the woman next door, who has tried to ask him for assistance several times.\n\nOn the bus ride home from the funeral, a depressed Aloys drinks himself to unconsciousness. When he wakes up the next morning in the bus, he finds his camera and the tapes of his subjects are all missing.\n\nA short time later a female voice calls him on the telephone, telling him that she stole his tapes, watched them, and plans to send them to the filmed subjects. Aloys threatens to call the police, but it proves an empty threat, instead using his skills to attempt to identify the caller via the clues. But the caller is always one step ahead of him, mocking his attempts.\n\nDuring one call, the female voice, in return for the tapes, asks Aloys to perform a \"telephone hike\", where both callers concentrate on visualizing a shared location and imagine conversing in their imagined locale. After hesitating, Aloys complies, going on an imagined walk through the woods together with the woman.\n\nWhen he tries to initiate further telephone hikes, the woman abruptly and angrily ends the conversation. Returning home one night, he finds his unconscious neighbor being loaded into an ambulance. Using some of the clues that he obtained while trying to unmask the caller, he realizes that his neighbor, Vera, the same one he ignored earlier, is the mysterious woman.\n\nHe learns Vera is a zookeeper who kept exotic animals, lost her job after kidnapping a sheep, and attempted suicide. Not knowing whether she survived, he volunteers to water her flowers and feed her pet [[iguana]].\n\nDays later, a hospitalized Vera texts Aloys thanking him for looking after her stuff. Aloys, elated, now tries to initiate the hikes. Vera hesitatingly gives in and both have repeated telephone hikes, with Aloys inviting her to a tour of his apartment to host a virtual party with all the people Aloys has watched or encountered in his investigations, and eventually, physically traveling to his favorite restaurant to have an imagined dinner with Vera, and visiting the zoo Vera worked at, with Vera giving him a tour through the phone.\n\nOne day, however, the real Vera, on leave from the hospital, attempts to visit Aloys at his apartment. He does not let her in, entranced by his imagined version of her, and afraid of human contact once more. A dejected Vera leaves and returns to the hospital. The shock of seeing the real Vera leave prompts Aloys into overcoming his fears, and he follows Vera to the hospital, sneaking into her room in the night and sleeping on the ground next to her bed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Georg Friedrich (actor)|Georg Friedrich]] as Aloys Adorn\n* [[Tilde von Overbeck]] as Vera\n* [[Kamil Krejc\u00ed]] as Herr Schoch\n* [[Yufei Li]] as Yen Lee\n* [[Koi Lee]] as Herr Lee\n* [[Sebastian Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl]] as Hauswart\n* [[Karl Friedrich (actor)|Karl Friedrich]] as Vater Aloys\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|5065810|Aloys}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aloys}}\n[[Category:2016 films]]\n[[Category:2016 drama films]]\n[[Category:Swiss films]]\n[[Category:Swiss drama films]]\n[[Category:Swiss German-language films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2016 film}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Aloys\n| image          = Aloys (film).jpg\n| caption        = Film poster\n| director       = [[Tobias N\u00f6lle]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = Tobias N\u00f6lle\n| starring       = [[Georg Friedrich (actor)|Georg Friedrich]]\n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = {{Film date|2016|2|13|[[66th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]]|2016|3|31|Switzerland|df=yes}}\n| runtime        = \n| country        = Switzerland\n| language       = Swiss German\n}}\n\n'''''Aloys''''' is a 2016 Swiss [[drama film]] directed by [[Tobias N\u00f6lle]].
