The Boomtown Rats' first appearance on Ireland's ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' saw Geldof as deliberately brusque to host [[Gay Byrne]] and during his interview he attacked Irish politicians and the Catholic Church, which he blamed for many of the country's problems.  He responded to nuns in the audience who tried to shout him down by saying they had \"an easy life with no material worries in return for which they gave themselves body and soul to the church\".  He also criticised [[Blackrock College]].

Stewart|Dave Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]]) and \"The Great Song of Indifference\". He also occasionally performed with other artists, such as [[David Gilmour]] and [[Thin Lizzy]]. A performance of \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" with Gilmour is documented in the 2002 DVD ''[[David Gilmour in Concert]]''. In 1992, he performed at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] with the surviving members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], singing a song he jokingly claimed to have co-written with Mercury, called \"Too Late God\". The song was actually co-written by [[Karl Hyde]].\n\nGeldof has also worked as a DJ for [[XFM]] radio.  In 1998, he [[List of premature obituaries|erroneously announced]] [[Ian Dury]]'s death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/500829/geldof-falsely-reports-dury-death.jhtml |title=Geldof Falsely Reports Dury Death |publisher=  MTV |date=27 August 1998}}</ref> The event caused music paper ''[[NME]]'' (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days\u2014primarily due to his disparagement of [[The Clash]]) to call Geldof \"the world's worst DJ\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/330571.stm |title=Geldof's choice a hit  |publisher=  BBC News |date=28 April 1999}}</ref>\n\nAlong with [[U2]]'s Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [[debt relief]] for developing countries. His commitments in this field, including the organisation of the Live 8 concerts, kept Geldof from producing any more musical output since 2001's ''Sex, Age & Death'' album.\n\nIn 2002, he was listed as one of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] in a poll conducted among the general public,<ref name=BBC100>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm| title=100 great British heroes| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC| date=21 August 2002| accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> despite not being British.\n\nAfter Live 8, Geldof returned to his career as a musician by releasing a box set containing all of his solo albums entitled ''Great Songs of Indifference \u2013 The Anthology 1986\u20132001'' in late 2005. Following that release, Geldof toured, albeit with mixed success.\n\nIn July 2006, Geldof arrived at [[Milan]]'s [[Arena Civica]], a venue capable of holding 12,000 people, to play a scheduled concert to find that the organisers had not put the tickets on general sale and that only 45 people had shown up.<ref>{{cite news | author=Barbara McMahon in Rome | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1827401,00.html |title=Guardian: Geldof cancels Italian tour after only 45 fans turn up for Milan gig |work=The Guardian |date= 24 July 2006|accessdate=10 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref>  Geldof refused to go on stage once he found out how small the attendance was. To offer some compensation for fans, Geldof stopped to sign autographs to those who had shown up.  He then played a well-attended free \"Storytellers\" concert for [[MTV Italy]] in Naples in October 2006.\n\n==Charity work==\n[[File:Breiti, Campino, Bob Geldof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Geldof performing with [[Die Toten Hosen]] at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [[Rostock, Germany|Rostock]], Germany on 7 June 2007]]\nGeldof's first major charity involvement took place in September 1981, when he performed as a solo artist for [[Amnesty International]]'s benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'', at the invitation of Amnesty show producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]]; he performed a solo version of \"I Don't Like Mondays\". Other rock artists had 'planted a seed' and appeared to have affected Geldof in a similar manner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/1020/1160606784745.html |title=Fri, Oct&nbsp;20, 2006 \u2013 REVOLVER |work=The Irish Times |date=10 October 2006 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Band Aid===\n{{Main|Band Aid (band)}}\nIn 1984, Geldof responded to a BBC news report from [[Michael Buerk]] about the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|famine in Ethiopia]] by mobilising the pop world to do something about the images he had seen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj2jf0US8zI |title=BBC on Ethiopian famine 1984 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref>  With [[Midge Ure]] of [[Ultravox]] he wrote \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" in order to raise funds. The song was recorded by various artists under the name of [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].\n\nIn its first week of release, the single became the UK's fastest-seller of all time, entering the chart at number one and going on to sell over 3 million copies, making it the biggest-selling single in UK history up to that point, a title it held for almost 13 years. The single was also a major US hit, peaking at number 13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" returned to the UK chart a year later, reaching number three, and eventually it raised over \u00a38&nbsp;million. Following this massive success, preparations were started for the biggest rock concerts the world had ever seen, the following summer.\n\nNew versions of ''Do They Know It's Christmas'' were recorded in 1989 and 2004. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [[Band Aid (band)#Band Aid 30|Band Aid 30]], to record an updated version of the [[Charity record|charity single]], with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola virus]] in West Africa.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Bob Geldof to record Band Aid 30 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29980841 |website= [[BBC News]]| date= 9 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Live Aid===\n{{Main|Live Aid}}\nAs Geldof began to learn more about the situation, he discovered that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was the obligation to make repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks. For every pound donated in aid, ten times as much would have to leave the country in loan repayments. It became obvious that one song was not enough.\n\nOn 13 July 1985, Geldof and Ure organised Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London and [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Thanks to an unprecedented decision by the BBC to clear its schedules for 16 hours of rock music, the event was also broadcast live in the UK on television and radio.\n\nIt was one of the most monumental stage shows in history, with [[Phil Collins]] flying on [[Concorde]] so that he could play at both Wembley and Philadelphia on the same day.\n\nDuring the broadcast of Live Aid, Geldof shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities but also by slamming his fist on the table and ordering them not to go out to the pub but to stay in and watch the show.\n\nNearly seven hours into the concert in London, Geldof gave an infamous interview in which he used the word ''fuck''.  The BBC presenter [[David Hepworth]], conducting the interview, had attempted to provide a list of addresses to which potential donations should be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted: \"Fuck the address, let's get the [phone] numbers!\"  It has passed into folklore<ref>{{cite web | title=1985 Live Aid \u2013 BBC web-site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1985/music1.shtml |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>  that he yelled at the audience, \"Give us your fucking money!\" although Geldof has stated that this phrase was never uttered.<ref>Geldof, Bob. ''Live Aid'' DVD.</ref>  Due to his Irish accent, the profanity was stated to be misheard as \"fock\" and \"focking\" respectively.  After the outburst, giving increased to \u00a3300 per second.\n\nThe harrowing video of dying, skeletal children that had been made by photo-journalists setting their films to the tune of \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\" by [[The Cars]], contributed to the concert's success.\n\nIn total, Live Aid raised over [[Pound sign|\u00a3]]150&nbsp;million for famine relief. Geldof subsequently received an honorary knighthood, at age 34, for his efforts. His autobiography, written soon after with [[Paul Vallely]], was entitled ''Is That It?''.<ref>''Is that it?'' Bob Geldof with Paul Vallely, Macmillan, 1986</ref> This book achieved further fame for being featured on the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] examination syllabus in a following year.\n\nMuch of the money raised by Live Aid went to NGOs in Ethiopia, some of which were under the influence or control of the [[Derg]] military junta. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [[Oxfam]] money to fund its enforced resettlement and \"villagification\" programmes, under which at least 3&nbsp;million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.<ref>David Rieff  [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/live8/story/0,16066,1513359,00.html \"Cruel to be kind?\",]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008043157/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/live8/story/0%2C16066%2C1513359%2C00.html |date= 8 October 2008 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 June 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=SPIN |url=http://www.spin.com/featured/live-aid-the-terrible-truth-ethiopia-bob-geldof-feature/ |title=Live Aid: The Terrible Truth |publisher=SPIN |date= |accessdate=27 July 2016}}</ref> However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.<ref>{{cite web | last=Midgley |first=Neil |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8035539/BBC-apologises-to-Bob-Geldof-for-Band-Aid-slur.html |title=BBC apologises to Bob Geldof for Band Aid slur |publisher=Telegraph |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Commission for Africa===\nIn January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid.  He telephoned the British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] from [[Addis Ababa]].  According to the Live 8 programme notes by Geldof's biographer and friend, [[Paul Vallely]], the Prime Minister responded: \"Calm down Bob. ... And come and see me as soon as you get back.\"<ref>Live 8 programme notes by Paul Vallely</ref>\n\nThe result was the [[Commission for Africa]].  Blair invited Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the majority from Africa and many of them politicians in power, to undertake a year-long study of Africa's problems.  They came up with two conclusions: that Africa needed to change, to improve its governance and combat corruption, and that the rich world needed to support that change in new ways.  That meant doubling aid, delivering debt cancellation, and reforming trade rules.  The Commission drew up a detailed plan of how that could be done.  It reported in March 2005.  To force the issue Geldof decided to create a new international lobby for Africa with eight simultaneous concerts around the world to put pressure on the [[G8]].  He called it [[Live 8]].  The Commission's recommendations later became the blueprint for the [[G8 Gleneagles]] African debt and aid package.\n\n===Africa Progress Panel===\nGeldof is a member of the [[Africa Progress Panel]] (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. Every year, the Panel releases a report, the Africa Progress Report, that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies.  In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africaprogresspanel.org/en/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2012/ |title=Africa Progress Report 2012 |publisher=Africa Progress Panel |accessdate=27 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109214313/http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/en/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2012/ |archivedate= 9 January 2013 }}</ref>  The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.\n\n===DATA and One Campaign===\nBob Geldof worked closely with [[DATA]] (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt-relief, third world trade and AIDS relief in Africa.  It merged with One Campaign in 2008, where Geldof also is very active.  In June 2009, on behalf of One Campaign, he co-edited a special edition of the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' with a view on [[35th G8 summit]].<ref name=stampa01>{{cite web|title=Direttore per un giorno |language=Italian |url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/esteri/200907articoli/45157girata.asp |date=4 July 2009 |work=La Stampa |location=Italy |accessdate=4 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707003006/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/esteri/200907articoli/45157girata.asp |archivedate=7 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Live 8 concerts===\n[[File:geldofsigning.jpg|right|thumb|Geldof at a ''Live 8: DVD'' signing]]\nOn 31 March 2005, Geldof and Ure announced the [[Live 8]] project, to raise awareness of issues that burden Africa, including government debt, trade barriers, hunger, and AIDS issues.

The Boomtown Rats' first appearance on Ireland's ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' saw Geldof as deliberately brusque to host [[Gay Byrne]] and during his interview he attacked Irish politicians and the Catholic Church, which he blamed for many of the country's problems.  He responded to nuns in the audience who tried to shout him down by saying they had \"an easy life with no material worries in return for which they gave themselves body and soul to the church\".  He also criticised [[Blackrock College]].

Stewart|Dave Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]]) and \"The Great Song of Indifference\". He also occasionally performed with other artists, such as [[David Gilmour]] and [[Thin Lizzy]]. A performance of \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" with Gilmour is documented in the 2002 DVD ''[[David Gilmour in Concert]]''. In 1992, he performed at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] with the surviving members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], singing a song he jokingly claimed to have co-written with Mercury, called \"Too Late God\". The song was actually co-written by [[Karl Hyde]].\n\nGeldof has also worked as a DJ for [[XFM]] radio.  In 1998, he [[List of premature obituaries|erroneously announced]] [[Ian Dury]]'s death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/500829/geldof-falsely-reports-dury-death.jhtml |title=Geldof Falsely Reports Dury Death |publisher=  MTV |date=27 August 1998}}</ref> The event caused music paper ''[[NME]]'' (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days\u2014primarily due to his disparagement of [[The Clash]]) to call Geldof \"the world's worst DJ\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/330571.stm |title=Geldof's choice a hit  |publisher=  BBC News |date=28 April 1999}}</ref>\n\nAlong with [[U2]]'s Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [[debt relief]] for developing countries. His commitments in this field, including the organisation of the Live 8 concerts, kept Geldof from producing any more musical output since 2001's ''Sex, Age & Death'' album.\n\nIn 2002, he was listed as one of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] in a poll conducted among the general public,<ref name=BBC100>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm| title=100 great British heroes| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC| date=21 August 2002| accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> despite not being British.\n\nAfter Live 8, Geldof returned to his career as a musician by releasing a box set containing all of his solo albums entitled ''Great Songs of Indifference \u2013 The Anthology 1986\u20132001'' in late 2005. Following that release, Geldof toured, albeit with mixed success.\n\nIn July 2006, Geldof arrived at [[Milan]]'s [[Arena Civica]], a venue capable of holding 12,000 people, to play a scheduled concert to find that the organisers had not put the tickets on general sale and that only 45 people had shown up.<ref>{{cite news | author=Barbara McMahon in Rome | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1827401,00.html |title=Guardian: Geldof cancels Italian tour after only 45 fans turn up for Milan gig |work=The Guardian |date= 24 July 2006|accessdate=10 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref>  Geldof refused to go on stage once he found out how small the attendance was. To offer some compensation for fans, Geldof stopped to sign autographs to those who had shown up.  He then played a well-attended free \"Storytellers\" concert for [[MTV Italy]] in Naples in October 2006.\n\n==Charity work==\n[[File:Breiti, Campino, Bob Geldof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Geldof performing with [[Die Toten Hosen]] at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [[Rostock, Germany|Rostock]], Germany on 7 June 2007]]\nGeldof's first major charity involvement took place in September 1981, when he performed as a solo artist for [[Amnesty International]]'s benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'', at the invitation of Amnesty show producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]]; he performed a solo version of \"I Don't Like Mondays\".

The song was recorded by various artists under the name of [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].\n\nIn its first week of release, the single became the UK's fastest-seller of all time, entering the chart at number one and going on to sell over 3 million copies, making it the biggest-selling single in UK history up to that point, a title it held for almost 13 years. The single was also a major US hit, peaking at number 13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" returned to the UK chart a year later, reaching number three, and eventually it raised over \u00a38&nbsp;million. Following this massive success, preparations were started for the biggest rock concerts the world had ever seen, the following summer.\n\nNew versions of ''Do They Know It's Christmas'' were recorded in 1989 and 2004. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [[Band Aid (band)#Band Aid 30|Band Aid 30]], to record an updated version of the [[Charity record|charity single]], with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola virus]] in West Africa.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Bob Geldof to record Band Aid 30 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29980841 |website= [[BBC News]]| date= 9 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Live Aid===\n{{Main|Live Aid}}\nAs Geldof began to learn more about the situation, he discovered that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was the obligation to make repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks. For every pound donated in aid, ten times as much would have to leave the country in loan repayments. It became obvious that one song was not enough.\n\nOn 13 July 1985, Geldof and Ure organised Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London and [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Thanks to an unprecedented decision by the BBC to clear its schedules for 16 hours of rock music, the event was also broadcast live in the UK on television and radio.\n\nIt was one of the most monumental stage shows in history, with [[Phil Collins]] flying on [[Concorde]] so that he could play at both Wembley and Philadelphia on the same day.\n\nDuring the broadcast of Live Aid, Geldof shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities but also by slamming his fist on the table and ordering them not to go out to the pub but to stay in and watch the show.\n\nNearly seven hours into the concert in London, Geldof gave an infamous interview in which he used the word ''fuck''.  The BBC presenter [[David Hepworth]], conducting the interview, had attempted to provide a list of addresses to which potential donations should be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted: \"Fuck the address, let's get the [phone] numbers!\"  It has passed into folklore<ref>{{cite web | title=1985 Live Aid \u2013 BBC web-site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1985/music1.shtml |accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>  that he yelled at the audience, \"Give us your fucking money!\" although Geldof has stated that this phrase was never uttered.<ref>Geldof, Bob. ''Live Aid'' DVD.</ref>  Due to his Irish accent, the profanity was stated to be misheard as \"fock\" and \"focking\" respectively.  After the outburst, giving increased to \u00a3300 per second.\n\nThe harrowing video of dying, skeletal children that had been made by photo-journalists setting their films to the tune of \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\" by [[The Cars]], contributed to the concert's success.\n\nIn total, Live Aid raised over [[Pound sign|\u00a3]]150&nbsp;million for famine relief. Geldof subsequently received an honorary knighthood, at age 34, for his efforts. His autobiography, written soon after with [[Paul Vallely]], was entitled ''Is That It?''.<ref>''Is that it?'' Bob Geldof with Paul Vallely, Macmillan, 1986</ref> This book achieved further fame for being featured on the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] examination syllabus in a following year.\n\nMuch of the money raised by Live Aid went to NGOs in Ethiopia, some of which were under the influence or control of the [[Derg]] military junta. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [[Oxfam]] money to fund its enforced resettlement and \"villagification\" programmes, under which at least 3&nbsp;million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.<ref>David Rieff  [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/live8/story/0,16066,1513359,00.html \"Cruel to be kind?\",]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008043157/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/live8/story/0%2C16066%2C1513359%2C00.html |date= 8 October 2008 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 June 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=SPIN |url=http://www.spin.com/featured/live-aid-the-terrible-truth-ethiopia-bob-geldof-feature/ |title=Live Aid: The Terrible Truth |publisher=SPIN |date= |accessdate=27 July 2016}}</ref> However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.<ref>{{cite web | last=Midgley |first=Neil |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8035539/BBC-apologises-to-Bob-Geldof-for-Band-Aid-slur.html |title=BBC apologises to Bob Geldof for Band Aid slur |publisher=Telegraph |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Commission for Africa===\nIn January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid.  He telephoned the British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] from [[Addis Ababa]].  According to the Live 8 programme notes by Geldof's biographer and friend, [[Paul Vallely]], the Prime Minister responded: \"Calm down Bob. ... And come and see me as soon as you get back.\"<ref>Live 8 programme notes by Paul Vallely</ref>\n\nThe result was the [[Commission for Africa]].  Blair invited Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the majority from Africa and many of them politicians in power, to undertake a year-long study of Africa's problems.  They came up with two conclusions: that Africa needed to change, to improve its governance and combat corruption, and that the rich world needed to support that change in new ways.  That meant doubling aid, delivering debt cancellation, and reforming trade rules.  The Commission drew up a detailed plan of how that could be done.  It reported in March 2005.  To force the issue Geldof decided to create a new international lobby for Africa with eight simultaneous concerts around the world to put pressure on the [[G8]].  He called it [[Live 8]].  The Commission's recommendations later became the blueprint for the [[G8 Gleneagles]] African debt and aid package.\n\n===Africa Progress Panel===\nGeldof is a member of the [[Africa Progress Panel]] (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. Every year, the Panel releases a report, the Africa Progress Report, that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies.  In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africaprogresspanel.org/en/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2012/ |title=Africa Progress Report 2012 |publisher=Africa Progress Panel |accessdate=27 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109214313/http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/en/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2012/ |archivedate= 9 January 2013 }}</ref>  The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.\n\n===DATA and the ONE Campaign===\nBob Geldof worked closely with [[DATA]] (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt-relief, third world trade and AIDS relief in Africa.  It merged with the [[ONE Campaign]] in 2008, where Geldof also is very active.  In June 2009, on behalf of the ONE Campaign, he co-edited a special edition of the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' with a view on [[35th G8 summit]].<ref name=stampa01>{{cite web|title=Direttore per un giorno |language=Italian |url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/esteri/200907articoli/45157girata.asp |date=4 July 2009 |work=La Stampa |location=Italy |accessdate=4 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707003006/http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/esteri/200907articoli/45157girata.asp |archivedate=7 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Live 8 concerts===\n[[File:geldofsigning.jpg|right|thumb|Geldof at a ''Live 8: DVD'' signing]]\nOn 31 March 2005, Geldof and Ure announced the [[Live 8]] project, to raise awareness of issues that burden Africa, including government debt, trade barriers, hunger, and AIDS issues.  Geldof organised ten concerts on 2 July 2005 in large cities throughout the industrialised world.  They featured musicians from different genres and locations around the world.
