Greenblatt-Janollari started producing shows in the 1998-1999 season with 3 comedy series for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]]. While funded by Fox, G-JS was presented as an \"independent mini-studio\".<ref name=cccmptvi/> With [[Fox Entertainment Group]] holding a 20% stake in New Regency Production's parent corporation, Fox Studios formed a joint venture, [[Regency Television]], by 2000, managed by [[Gail Berman]].<ref name=cccmptvi/><ref name=dl/> Another production unit formed was Fox Television Studios Productions (FTSP) under Lisa Berger. Early output by the individual units, or \"pods\" were FTSP's ''[[Son of the Beach]]'' for FX, ''[[The Hughleys]]'' by G-JS and Regency had ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''.<ref name=dl/>\n\nThe pod model faded into five divisions: alternative, scripted, international, Fox World and Regency TV. The alternative division was responsible for ''[[Talkshow with Spike Feresten]]'' and ''[[The Wanda Sykes Show]]'', along with [[E!]]'s ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' franchise. The scripted division produced ''[[The Shield]]'', along with a number of television films and miniseries.<ref name=dl/>\n\nFox World division had acquired rights to \"The Coach\" in early 2002 from France\u2019s TF1 and its Quai Sud production entity. In mid-2002, Fox Alternative Productions was formed by Fox TV Studios and headed by David Martin with its first show to be \"The Coach\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Michael |last2=Schneider |first2=Michael |title=Fox to stage real \u2018Coach\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/fox-to-stage-real-coach-1117870351/ |accessdate=July 12, 2019 |work=Variety |date=July 29, 2002 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter a while, the only division operating was the scripted unit. Next FTVS attempted international co-productions of direct-to-series broadcast series. The company had a hit with ''[[Burn Notice]]'' on USA Network. In August 2010, Dave Madden was appointed to head the unit, where he evenly increased its production slates until he was appointed as president of entertainment for Fox Broadcasting in August 2014.<ref name=dl/>\n\n===Fox 21===\n'''Fox 21''' was formed in 2004 by [[20th Century Fox Television]] executives [[Dana Walden]] and Gary Newman to develop and back smaller-budgeted but unique and daring shows.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die.

This was the accepted position of Christian thought at this time.\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

In York's own words, \"Gary Cooper and I were propelling a [[handcar]] carrying several 'wounded' men down [the] railroad track. I was on the bottom stroke of this sort of teeter-totter mechanism that made the handcar run. I was just lifting the handle up as the director yelled 'cut!' and one of the 'wounded' cast members reached up and grabbed the handle. Now, instead of lifting the expected weight, I was suddenly, jarringly, lifting his entire weight off the flatbed-180 pounds or so. The muscles along the right side of my back tore. They just snapped and let loose. And that was the start of it all: the pain, the painkillers, the addiction, the lost career.\"<ref name=\"Douglas\"/>\n\nYork's injury did not immediately end his career. In 1960, a year after York's injury, he played Bertram Cates (modeled on [[John Thomas Scopes]], of \"[[Monkey Trial]]\" fame) in the film version of ''Inherit the Wind''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inherit the Wind|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE76ABC4B52DFB667838B679EDE|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=October 13, 1960|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nYork went on to star with [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leo G. Carroll]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy-drama ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'' (1962). York was cast in the series, which lasted one season, as Tom Colwell, who operates a secular youth center.\n\nYork appeared in dozens of episodes of now-classic television series, including ''[[Justice (1954 TV series)|Justice]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', and CBS's ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\n==''Bewitched''==\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|left|York with ''[[Bewitched]]'' co-stars [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] as Samantha Stephens (front) and [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Endora (back).]]\nYork was cast as Darrin Stephens in the 1960s sitcom ''Bewitched'' as Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal husband. The show was a huge success and York was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in 1968.<ref name=\"People1989\"/> \n\nThe crew built York a slanted wall for him to lean on in between scenes, which, during the first two seasons, allowed York to manage his back injury with little difficulty. By the third season, the injury started to become increasingly agitated, frequently causing shooting delays while York required assistance to walk around. Sometimes, York would seize up in debilitating pain, so the scripts for some of his later episodes on ''Bewitched'' were written around his being in bed or on the couch for the entire episode. York did not appear in a handful of season 3 and 4 episodes, and by halfway through Season 5, was barely appearing at all, causing the series to focus more on Samantha and other members of her family, with mentions that Darrin was away on business. In spite of his suffering, York maintained a professional presence on camera.\n\nWhile filming the fifth-season episode \"Daddy Does His Thing\", York fell ill: \"I was too sick to go on. I had a temperature of 105, full of strong antibiotics, for almost 10 days. I went to work that day but I was sick. I lay in my dressing room after being in make-up, waiting to be called on the set. They knew I was feeling pretty rotten, and they tried to give me time to rest. I kept having chills. This was the middle of the summer and I was wearing a sheepskin jacket and I was chilling. I was shaking all over.  Then, while sitting on a scaffolding with [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], being lit for a special effects scene: They were setting an inky \u2013 that's a little tiny spot[light] that was supposed to be just flickering over my eyes. That flickering, flickering flickering made me feel weird. And I'm sitting on this platform up in the air...and I turned to Gibby, who was just down below, and I said, 'Gibby, I think I have to get down.' He started to help me down and that's the last thing I remember until I woke up on the floor. That's about all I remember of the incident...and I'd managed to bite a very large hole in the side of my tongue before they could pry my teeth apart.\"<ref name=\"Douglas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bewitched.net/filmfax.htm|title=Dick York of Bewitched - A Farewell Interview|last=Douglas|first=John|publisher=bewitched.net|date=April 1992|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrom York's hospital bed, he and director [[William Asher]] discussed York's future. \"Do you want to quit?\" Asher asked. \"If it's all right with you, Billy,\" York replied. With that, York left the sitcom to devote himself to recovery. He never again returned to the set.  [[Dick Sargent]] replaced York in the role of Darrin Stephens, taking over the role at the start of the series' sixth season (1970-1971) and continuing in the part until the series ended after its seventh season (1971-1972). Sargent was originally offered the role of Darrin in 1964, but turned it down to do a short-lived sitcom called ''[[Broadside (TV series)|Broadside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=No More \"Straight Man,\" Dick Sargent is Out and Proud|url=http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/sargent_interview.htm|first=Owen|last=Keehnen|work=Chicago Outlines|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nFor the next 18 months, York was largely bed-ridden in a haze of prescription painkillers.<ref name=\"LATimes1989\"/> In his memoir, ''[[The Seesaw Girl and Me]]'', published posthumously, he describes the struggle to break his addiction and come to grips with the loss of his career. The book is in large part a love letter to his wife, Joan (n\u00e9e Alt), the seesaw girl of the title, who stuck with him through the hard times. \n\nHe then quit drugs cold turkey, which led to six months of difficult withdrawal and recovery. \"I had a band playing in my head, bagpipes night and day,\" York recalled. \"It just went on and on and on and on and on. . . . The fans whisper to you and the walls whisper to you and you look at television and sometimes it flashes in a certain way that sends you into a fit and you know that your wife has put her hand in your mouth so you won't bite off your tongue.

His best known motion picture role was as teacher Bertram Cates in the film ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1960).\n\n==Early life==\nYork was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], to Betty, a seamstress, and Bernard York, a salesman.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dick York, 63, Actor Who Was Husband In TV's 'Bewitched'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/22/arts/dick-york-63-actor-who-was-husband-in-tv-s-bewitched.html|accessdate=November 8, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=February 22, 1992}}</ref><ref name=\"People1989\">{{cite journal|last1=Allis|first1=Tim|last2=Leonhauser|first2=Maria|title=Shut in but Not Shut Off, Actor Dick York Gives the Time He Has Left to the Homeless|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 6, 1989|volume=31|issue=9|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119715,00.html|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> He grew up in [[Chicago]], where a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] nun first recognized his vocal promise.<ref name=\"LATimes1989\">{{cite web|last=Secter|first=Bob|title=Bewitched by a Cause : Dick York Is Dying of Emphysema but He Lives to Help the Homeless|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-08/news/vw-2079_1_dick-york|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 8, 1989|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> He began his career at the age of 15 as the star of the [[CBS]] [[radio program]] ''That Brewster Boy''.

In York's own words, \"Gary Cooper and I were propelling a [[handcar]] carrying several 'wounded' men down [the] railroad track. I was on the bottom stroke of this sort of teeter-totter mechanism that made the handcar run. I was just lifting the handle up as the director yelled 'cut!' and one of the 'wounded' cast members reached up and grabbed the handle. Now, instead of lifting the expected weight, I was suddenly, jarringly, lifting his entire weight off the flatbed-180 pounds or so. The muscles along the right side of my back tore. They just snapped and let loose. And that was the start of it all: the pain, the painkillers, the addiction, the lost career.\"<ref name=\"Douglas\"/>\n\nYork's injury did not immediately end his career. In 1960, a year after York's injury, he played Bertram Cates (modeled on [[John Thomas Scopes]], of \"[[Monkey Trial]]\" fame) in the film version of ''Inherit the Wind''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inherit the Wind|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE76ABC4B52DFB667838B679EDE|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=October 13, 1960|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nYork went on to star with [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leo G. Carroll]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy-drama ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'' (1962). York was cast in the series, which lasted one season, as Tom Colwell, who operates a secular youth center.\n\nYork appeared in dozens of episodes of now-classic television series, including ''[[Justice (1954 TV series)|Justice]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', and CBS's ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\n==''Bewitched''==\n[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|left|York with ''[[Bewitched]]'' co-stars [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] as Samantha Stephens (front) and [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Endora (back).]]\nYork was cast as Darrin Stephens in the 1960s sitcom ''Bewitched'' as Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal husband. The show was a huge success and York was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in 1968.<ref name=\"People1989\"/> \n\nThe crew built York a slanted wall for him to lean on in between scenes, which, during the first two seasons, allowed York to manage his back injury with little difficulty. By the third season, the injury started to become increasingly agitated, frequently causing shooting delays while York required assistance to walk around. Sometimes, York would seize up in debilitating pain, so the scripts for some of his later episodes on ''Bewitched'' were written around his being in bed or on the couch for the entire episode. York did not appear in a handful of season 3 and 4 episodes, and by halfway through Season 5, was barely appearing at all, causing the series to focus more on Samantha and other members of her family, with mentions that Darrin was away on business. In spite of his suffering, York maintained a professional presence on camera.\n\nWhile filming the fifth-season episode \"Daddy Does His Thing\", York fell ill: \"I was too sick to go on. I had a temperature of 105, full of strong antibiotics, for almost 10 days. I went to work that day but I was sick. I lay in my dressing room after being in make-up, waiting to be called on the set. They knew I was feeling pretty rotten, and they tried to give me time to rest. I kept having chills. This was the middle of the summer and I was wearing a sheepskin jacket and I was chilling. I was shaking all over.  Then, while sitting on a scaffolding with [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], being lit for a special effects scene: They were setting an inky \u2013 that's a little tiny spot[light] that was supposed to be just flickering over my eyes. That flickering, flickering flickering made me feel weird. And I'm sitting on this platform up in the air...and I turned to Gibby, who was just down below, and I said, 'Gibby, I think I have to get down.' He started to help me down and that's the last thing I remember until I woke up on the floor. That's about all I remember of the incident...and I'd managed to bite a very large hole in the side of my tongue before they could pry my teeth apart.\"<ref name=\"Douglas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bewitched.net/filmfax.htm|title=Dick York of Bewitched - A Farewell Interview|last=Douglas|first=John|publisher=bewitched.net|date=April 1992|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrom York's hospital bed, he and director [[William Asher]] discussed York's future. \"Do you want to quit?\" Asher asked. \"If it's all right with you, Billy,\" York replied. With that, York left the sitcom to devote himself to recovery. He never again returned to the set.  [[Dick Sargent]] replaced York in the role of Darrin Stephens, taking over the role at the start of the series' sixth season (1970-1971) and continuing in the part until the series ended after its seventh season (1971-1972). Sargent was originally offered the role of Darrin in 1964, but turned it down to do a short-lived sitcom called ''[[Broadside (TV series)|Broadside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=No More \"Straight Man,\" Dick Sargent is Out and Proud|url=http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/sargent_interview.htm|first=Owen|last=Keehnen|work=Chicago Outlines|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nFor the next 18 months, York was largely bed-ridden in a haze of prescription painkillers.<ref name=\"LATimes1989\"/> In his memoir, ''[[The Seesaw Girl and Me]]'', published posthumously, he describes the struggle to break his addiction and come to grips with the loss of his career. The book is in large part a love letter to his wife, Joan (n\u00e9e Alt), the seesaw girl of the title, who stuck with him through the hard times. \n\nHe then quit drugs cold turkey, which led to six months of difficult withdrawal and recovery. \"I had a band playing in my head, bagpipes night and day,\" York recalled. \"It just went on and on and on and on and on. . . . The fans whisper to you and the walls whisper to you and you look at television and sometimes it flashes in a certain way that sends you into a fit and you know that your wife has put her hand in your mouth so you won't bite off your tongue. You can't sleep. You hallucinate.

Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific [[Fc Receptor]] (FcR), except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR, thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds.

These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hypervariable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.\n\nAntibody genes also re-organize in a process called [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]] that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.

An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants.\n\nAntibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific \u2013 for example [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[hydrophobic interactions]], and [[van der Waals force]]s. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.\n\nOften, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an [[immune complex]], which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, [[hapten]]s are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier [[adduct]] is antigenic.\n\n==Isotypes==\nAntibodies can come in different varieties known as [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]] or classes. In [[eutheria|placental]] mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.

Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This implies different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).\n\n== Function ==\n{{further|Immune system}}\n\nThe main categories of antibody action include the following:\n\n[[File:Antibody Opsonization.svg|thumb|1) Antibodies (A) and pathogens (B) free roam in the blood. 2) The antibodies bind to pathogens, and can do so in different formations such as: opsonization (2a), neutralisation (2b), and agglutination (2c). 3) A phagocyte (C) approaches the pathogen, and the Fc region (D) of the antibody binds to one of the Fc receptors (E) of the phagocyte. 4) Phagocytosis occurs as the pathogen is ingested.]]\n\n* [[Neutralisation (immunology)|Neutralisation]], in which [[neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]] block parts of the surface of a bacterial cell or virion to render its attack ineffective\n* [[Agglutination (biology)|Agglutination]], in which antibodies \"glue together\" foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]\n* [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]], in which antibodies \"glue together\" [[blood serum|serum]]-soluble antigens, forcing them to precipitate out of solution in clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]\n* [[Complement system#Overview|Complement activation]] (fixation), in which antibodies that are latched onto a foreign cell encourage complement to attack it with a [[membrane attack complex]], which leads to the following:\n** [[Lysis]] of the foreign cell \n** Encouragement of [[inflammation]] by [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] attracting inflammatory cells\n\nActivated B cells [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into either antibody-producing cells called [[plasma cell]]s that secrete soluble antibody or [[memory B cell|memory cells]] that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.<ref name=\"pmid17337763\"/>\n\nAt the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].<ref name=Ravetch>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravetch JV, Bolland S | title = IgG Fc receptors | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 275\u201390 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11244038 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275 }}</ref> Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).\n\n[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units.

Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.<ref name=Pier/>\n\nThose cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) \u2013 this process may explain the efficacy of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] used in [[biopharmaceutical|biological]] therapies against [[cancer]]. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.<ref name=Janeway5/>\n\n===Natural antibodies===\nHumans and higher primates also produce \"natural antibodies\" that are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or [[passive immunization]]. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide [[galactose]] \u03b1(1,3)-galactose (\u03b1-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut.<ref>{{cite web|author=Racaniello, Vincent |url=http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |date=6 October 2009 |title=Natural antibody protects against viral infection |website=Virology Blog |access-date=22 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220015318/http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |archive-date=20 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Rejection of [[Organ xenotransplantation|xenotransplantated organs]] is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to \u03b1-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Milland J, Sandrin MS | title = ABO blood group and related antigens, natural antibodies and transplantation | journal = Tissue Antigens | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 459\u201366 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17176435 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00721.x }}</ref>\n\n==Immunoglobulin diversity==\nVirtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response.

One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or [[complementarity-determining region]]s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.<ref>Peter Parham. ''The Immune System''. 2nd ed.

The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces\u2014known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.<ref name = namazee/> V, D and J segments are found in [[immunoglobulin heavy chain|Ig heavy chains]], but only V and J segments are found in [[Immunoglobulin light chain|Ig light chains]]. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the [[genome]]s of [[mammal]]s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different [[wikt:paratope|paratopes]], and thus different antigen specificities.<ref name=Market/> The rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.\n\nRAG proteins play an important role with V(D)J recombination in cutting DNA at a particular region.<ref name=\"Market\"/> Without the presence of these proteins, V(D)J recombination would not occur.<ref name=\"Market\"/>\n\nAfter a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as [[allelic exclusion]]) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.<ref name=Janeway5/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergman Y, Cedar H | title = A stepwise epigenetic process controls immunoglobulin allelic exclusion | journal = Nature Reviews.

SHM results in approximately one [[nucleotide]] change per variable gene, per cell division.<ref name=diaz/> As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight [[amino acid]] differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.\n\nThis serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding [[Chemical affinity|affinity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Honjo T, Habu S | title = Origin of immune diversity: genetic variation and selection | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 803\u201330 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3927822 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.004103 }}</ref> Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity).<ref name=orguil>{{cite journal | vauthors = Or-Guil M, Wittenbrink N, Weiser AA, Schuchhardt J | title = Recirculation of germinal center B cells: a multilevel selection strategy for antibody maturation | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 216 | pages = 130\u201341 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17367339 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00507.x }}</ref> B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by [[apoptosis]].<ref name=orguil/> Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of antibodies to increase over time.

Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT | title = Evolution of isotype switching | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 257\u201375 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15522624 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005 }}</ref>\n\nClass switching occurs in the heavy chain gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR).

Validation studies should\nat least include:\n\n* The demonstration that the process is able to produce in good quality (the process should be validated)\n* \n* The [[efficiency]] of the antibody purification (all [[impurities]] and [[virus]] must be eliminated)\n* \n* The characterization of purified antibody ([[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] characterization, [[immunological]] properties, [[biological]] activities, contaminants, ...)\n* Determination of the virus clearance studies\n\n===Before clinical trials===\n \n* Product safety testing: Sterility (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo testing for adventitious viruses, Murine retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately life-threatening conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.\n* Feasibility testing:  These are pilot studies whose objectives include, among others, early characterization of safety and initial proof of concept in a small specific patient population (in vitro or in vivo testing).\n\n===Preclinical studies===\n\n* Testing [[cross-reactivity]] of antibody: to highlight unwanted interactions (toxicity) of antibodies with previously characterized tissues. This study can be performed in vitro (Reactivity of the antibody or immunoconjugate should be determined with a quick-frozen adult tissues) or in vivo (with appropriates animal models). \n* Preclinical [[pharmacology]] and [[toxicity]] testing: [[preclinical]] safety testing of antibody is designed to identify possible toxicity in humans, to estimate the likelihood and severity of potential adverse events in humans, and to identify a safe starting dose and dose escalation, when possible. \n* Animal toxicity studies: Acute toxicity testing, Repeat-dose toxicity testing, Long-term toxicity testing\n* Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics testing: Use for determinate clinical dosages, antibody activities, evaluation of the potential clinical effects\n\n==Structure prediction and computational antibody design ==\nThe importance of antibodies in health care and the [[biotechnology]] industry demands knowledge of their structures at [[Image resolution|high resolution]].

An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants.\n\nAntibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific \u2013 for example [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[hydrophobic interactions]], and [[van der Waals force]]s.

Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.\n\nOften, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an [[immune complex]], which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies.

Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This implies different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).\n\n== Function ==\n{{further|Immune system}}\n\nThe main categories of antibody action include the following:\n\n[[File:Antibody Opsonization.svg|thumb|1) Antibodies (A) and pathogens (B) free roam in the blood. 2) The antibodies bind to pathogens, and can do so in different formations such as: opsonization (2a), neutralisation (2b), and agglutination (2c). 3) A phagocyte (C) approaches the pathogen, and the Fc region (D) of the antibody binds to one of the Fc receptors (E) of the phagocyte. 4) Phagocytosis occurs as the pathogen is ingested.]]\n\n* [[Neutralisation (immunology)|Neutralisation]], in which [[neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]] block parts of the surface of a bacterial cell or virion to render its attack ineffective\n* [[Agglutination (biology)|Agglutination]], in which antibodies \"glue together\" foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]\n* [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]], in which antibodies \"glue together\" [[blood serum|serum]]-soluble antigens, forcing them to precipitate out of solution in clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]\n* [[Complement system#Overview|Complement activation]] (fixation), in which antibodies that are latched onto a foreign cell encourage complement to attack it with a [[membrane attack complex]], which leads to the following:\n** [[Lysis]] of the foreign cell \n** Encouragement of [[inflammation]] by [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] attracting inflammatory cells\n\nActivated B cells [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into either antibody-producing cells called [[plasma cell]]s that secrete soluble antibody or [[memory B cell|memory cells]] that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.<ref name=\"pmid17337763\"/>\n\nAt the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].<ref name=Ravetch>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravetch JV, Bolland S | title = IgG Fc receptors | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 275\u201390 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11244038 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275 }}</ref> Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).\n\n[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units.

By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.<ref name=Pier/>\n\nThose cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe.

Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or [[passive immunization]].

Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT | title = Evolution of isotype switching | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 257\u201375 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15522624 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005 }}</ref>\n\nClass switching occurs in the heavy chain gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR).

Antibodies are used in [[flow cytometry]] to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of [[cluster of differentiation]] molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins.<ref name=Stecher>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brehm-Stecher BF, Johnson EA | title = Single-cell microbiology: tools, technologies, and applications | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 538\u201359, table of contents | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15353569 | pmc = 515252 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.3.538-559.2004 }}</ref> They are also used in [[immunoprecipitation]] to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a [[cell lysate]],<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Williams NE | title = Immunoprecipitation procedures | volume = 62 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/tetrahymenatherm62acad/page/449 449\u201353] | year = 2000 | pmid = 10503210 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-679X(08)61549-6 | isbn = 978-0-12-544164-3 | series = Methods in Cell Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/tetrahymenatherm62acad/page/449 | publisher = San Diego, CA : Academic Press }}</ref> in [[Western blot]] analyses to identify proteins separated by [[electrophoresis]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurien BT, Scofield RH | title = Western blotting | journal = Methods | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 283\u201393 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16483794 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2005.11.007 }}</ref> and in [[immunohistochemistry]] or [[immunofluorescence]] to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells with the assistance of a [[microscope]].<ref name=Stecher/><ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Scanziani E | title = Immunohistochemical staining of fixed tissues | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 104 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/mycoplasmaprotoc00roge/page/133 133\u201340] | year = 1998 | pmid = 9711649 | doi = 10.1385/0-89603-525-5:133 | isbn = 978-0-89603-525-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/mycoplasmaprotoc00roge/page/133 | publisher = Totowa, N.J. : Humana Press }}</ref> Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using [[ELISA]] and [[ELISpot]] techniques.<ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Reen DJ | title = Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 32 | pages = 461\u20136 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7951745 | doi = 10.1385/0-89603-268-X:461 | isbn = 978-0-89603-268-2 | pmc = 2366430 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Kalyuzhny AE | title = Chemistry and biology of the ELISPOT assay | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 302 | pages = 15\u201331 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15937343 | doi = 10.1385/1-59259-903-6:015 | isbn = 978-1-59259-903-5 }}</ref>\n\nAntibodies used in research are some of the most powerful, yet most problematic reagents with a tremendous number of factors that must be controlled in any experiment including cross reactivity, or the antibody recognizing multiple epitopes and affinity, which can vary widely depending on experimental conditions such as pH, solvent, state of tissue etc. Multiple attempts have been made to improve both the way that researchers validate antibodies<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saper CB | title = An open letter to our readers on the use of antibodies | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 493 | issue = 4 | pages = 477\u20138 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16304632 | doi = 10.1002/cne.20839 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-011.html|title=NOT-OD-16-011: Implementing Rigor and Transparency in NIH & AHRQ Research Grant Applications|website=grants.nih.gov}}</ref> and ways in which they report on antibodies.

In some cases, additional fusions with other lines have created \"triomas\" and \"quadromas\". The manufacturing process should be appropriately described and validated. Validation studies should\nat least include:\n\n* The demonstration that the process is able to produce in good quality (the process should be validated)\n* \n* The [[efficiency]] of the antibody purification (all [[impurities]] and [[virus]] must be eliminated)\n* \n* The characterization of purified antibody ([[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] characterization, [[immunological]] properties, [[biological]] activities, contaminants, ...)\n* Determination of the virus clearance studies\n\n===Before clinical trials===\n \n* Product safety testing: Sterility (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo testing for adventitious viruses, Murine retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately life-threatening conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.\n* Feasibility testing:  These are pilot studies whose objectives include, among others, early characterization of safety and initial proof of concept in a small specific patient population (in vitro or in vivo testing).\n\n===Preclinical studies===\n\n* Testing [[cross-reactivity]] of antibody: to highlight unwanted interactions (toxicity) of antibodies with previously characterized tissues. This study can be performed in vitro (Reactivity of the antibody or immunoconjugate should be determined with a quick-frozen adult tissues) or in vivo (with appropriates animal models). \n* Preclinical [[pharmacology]] and [[toxicity]] testing: [[preclinical]] safety testing of antibody is designed to identify possible toxicity in humans, to estimate the likelihood and severity of potential adverse events in humans, and to identify a safe starting dose and dose escalation, when possible. \n* Animal toxicity studies: Acute toxicity testing, Repeat-dose toxicity testing, Long-term toxicity testing\n* Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics testing: Use for determinate clinical dosages, antibody activities, evaluation of the potential clinical effects\n\n==Structure prediction and computational antibody design ==\nThe importance of antibodies in health care and the [[biotechnology]] industry demands knowledge of their structures at [[Image resolution|high resolution]]. This information is used for [[protein engineering]], modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. [[X-ray crystallography]] is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures.

Pictures included all of its features produced and distributed by Warner Bros. prior to 1950 (Warner Bros. retained the rights to two 1949 films it only distributed<!--which two?-->), and also included was the film ''[[Chain Lightning (1950 film)|Chain Lightning]]'' (produced in 1949 and released in 1950). Also included were the live-action short subjects released prior to September 1, 1948.\n\nThe cartoon library included every color ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' short released prior to August 1, 1948, and all of the ''Merrie Melodies'' produced by [[Harman and Ising|Harman-Ising Productions]] from 1931 to 1933, except ''[[Lady, Play Your Mandolin!]]'' (1931). The remaining black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made from 1933 to 1934 and the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' were not included in the library. Former Warner cartoon director [[Bob Clampett]] was hired to catalog the Warner cartoon library.\n\n==Film archive==\nIn 1969, the United Artists Corporation presented to the [[Library of Congress]] the earliest surviving preprint material from the pre-1950 film library of Warner Bros. (including [[First National Pictures|First National]] library). The collection contains 200 silent features (1918\u201329), 800 sound features (1926\u201350), 1,800 sound shorts (1926\u201348), and 337 ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts (1931\u201348). While consisting largely of Warner Bros. releases, the collection includes nearly two hundred sound features released by Monogram Pictures Corporation between 1936 and 1946 and 231 ''Popeye'' cartoons produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] released between 1933 and 1957. Most motion pictures exist in the original black-and-white/Technicolor camera negatives. The Library is converting the nitrate film to safety stock and has obtained reference prints for seventy of the better known Warner Bros. features, such as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'' (1935), ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932), ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), and ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1930). There are no [[United Artists]] films (such as ''[[James Bond]]'' and ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' franchise; these are owned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]) in the United Artists Collection. The early synchronized sound [[Vitaphone]] shorts are lacking accompanying sound discs.\n\nThis is a large collection of nitrate negatives and masters, which are still undergoing transfer to acetate stock. Most of the safety film copies exist only in the preservation master stage, limiting accessibility for viewing and duplication. Some years ago, LC obtained 16mm prints (though many are television prints, flat in picture quality and occasionally edited) for pre-1950 Warner Bros. features (among the most popular of all American films). Additional prints have been added to the collection, ranging from \"reject fine grain master positives\" (copies made for preservation but deemed inadequate) suitable for reference use, to high-quality 35mm prints reserved for theatrical projection. United Artists also donated 16mm prints of most of the Warner Bros. and Monogram films to the [[Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research]], such as ''[[My Four Years in Germany]]'' (1918),<ref>[https://archive.is/20160320105027/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wcftr/filmlist/title.asp?film_id=34461 My Four Years in Germany (1918)] </ref> ''[[Conductor 1492]]'' (1924), ''[[Midnight Lovers (1926 film)|Midnight Lovers]]'' (1926) and ''[[Joe Palooka in Triple Cross]]'' (1951).\n\nTitles and holdings are listed in the various M/B/RS catalogs. There are a number of published reference books on Warner Bros. films.<ref>''Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress'' by The American Film Institute, c. 1978.</ref> Copyrights are still in effect for most of the films in this collection; a donor restriction also applies. United Artists has passed through various hands, but current ownership of this material resides with Turner Entertainment Co.\n\n==Ownership of properties==\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] purchased United Artists (along with the a.a.p. library) from [[Transamerica Corporation]] in 1981 and became [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#MGM/UA Entertainment|MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]]\n\nThe rights to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1948 film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', originally distributed by Warner Bros. (with MGM) and later copyrighted by UATV, reverted to the director in 1968. Distribution rights were later acquired by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1983.\n\n[[Turner Broadcasting System]] (via [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]) took over the library in 1986 after [[Ted Turner]]'s short-lived ownership of MGM/UA. When Turner sold back the MGM/UA production unit, he kept the MGM library, including select portions of the a.a.p. library (limited to the Warner Bros. films and the ''Popeye'' cartoons), for his own company. The 1936\u20131946 Monogram films were not included with the purchase, and thus some of these films remain with MGM.\n\nThe Warner Bros. film libraries were reunited when Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]), the studio's parent company since the 1990 merger of [[Time Inc.]] and [[Warner Communications]] (formerly [[Kinney National Company]]), bought Turner in 1996. Turner remains the copyright owner in name only to the former Associated Artists Productions properties, while WarnerMedia handles their distribution.\n\nUA originally leased video rights to their library (including the a.a.p. library) to [[Magnetic Video]], the first home video company. Magnetic Video was sold to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1982, becoming 20th Century-Fox Video. In 1982, Fox and [[CBS]] formed [[CBS/Fox Video]], which continued to distribute the UA/a.a.p. library under license from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] until the rights reverted to MGM/UA. After Turner's purchase of the MGM/UA library, MGM/UA Home Video continued to distribute the films on video under license until 1999. MGM/UA paid Time Warner US$225 million to end their contract of distributing the Associated Artists Productions library early.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-mar-16-fi-17731-story.html|title=MGM Buys Its Way Out of Pact for $225 Million|last=Bates|first=James|access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref> The rights to distribute were then transferred to [[Warner Home Video]] in 2000. Laboratory in Brooklyn to Consolidated Labs in N.J. thus avoiding the New York sales tax on the purchase. Subsequently the negatives were split up between several labs in the NY area including DuArt, Mercury, Deluxe and CFI. Each lab made new acetate 16mm internegatives and re-recorded sound tracks. Some of the color films were in Technicolor and, as was Technicolor's policy, they held the 3 color negatives and mage prints. TV stations used 16mm prints for their telecasting and each lab made the prints for the titles they held.\n\nThese same prints would be the ones used on pre-1999 VHS and laserdisc releases of former a.a.p.-owned films. The a.a.p. versions of these films were also later used for cable television broadcasts (even as recently as March 2011, a.a.p. prints of WB cartoons have been seen on TV). Early releases of WB films released between 1918\u20131931 bore an a.a.p. copyright renewal notice, since these renewals came before the UA purchase, however those copyrights have since been reassigned to Turner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/v-title-database/lone/little-caesar-rca-2.html|title=Little Caesar : RCA&#93; {76476034122} U - Side 2 - CED Title - Blu-ray DVD Movie Precursor|publisher=Cedmagic.com|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Turner began removing the a.a.p. logos from many of the films (although this process started before that by both UA and local television stations). With the a.a.p. logos being removed, Turner also began creating \"dubbed versions\" that same year, which are available in American and European formats and most had altered ending cards and color borders in the opening titles for the print given, which they kept, for the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons. These \"dubbed\" prints attempted to make the material look better with whatever prints they had access to, though some ended up looking worse. One hundred twenty-three of the Warner Bros. cartoons purchased by a.a.p. were restored from their original negatives for inclusion in Warner Home Video's series of six ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' DVD box sets. Several more WB cartoons formerly owned by a.a.p. have been restored for other ''Looney Tunes'' DVD releases since 2010. The black and white ''Popeye'' cartoons (and the three ''Color Specials'') were also restored from their original negatives for a series of three ''[[Popeye the Sailor (film series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' DVD sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd|title=Popeye DVD|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=August 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130353/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd-2993.html|archivedate=December 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n* a.a.p.

Dominant also sold and/or leased 16mm prints of WB library titles to non-theatrical rental libraries. The subsidiary was later folded into UA's main theatrical distribution arm after the company was sold to UA.

With the twin syndicated packages of ''[[Looney Tunes]]''/''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and ''Popeye'', u.a.a. took a look at a number of shorts in the a.a.p./pre-1950 WB library that appealed to children and packaged them in a third group known as ''The Big Mac Show'', which has a cartoon wrap around.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=When A.A.P. became U.A.A.|url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/when-a-a-p-became-u-a-a-2/|accessdate=November 24, 2017|work=Cartoon Research|date=February 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution rights==\nThe material a.a.p. bought from Warner Bros. Pictures included all of its features produced and distributed by Warner Bros. prior to 1950 (Warner Bros. retained the rights to two 1949 films it only distributed<!--which two?-->), and also included was the film ''[[Chain Lightning (1950 film)|Chain Lightning]]'' (produced in 1949 and released in 1950). Also included were the live-action short subjects released prior to September 1, 1948.\n\nThe cartoon library included every color ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' short released prior to August 1, 1948, and all of the ''Merrie Melodies'' produced by [[Harman and Ising|Harman-Ising Productions]] from 1931 to 1933, except ''[[Lady, Play Your Mandolin!]]'' (1931). The remaining black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made from 1933 to 1934 and the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' were not included in the library. Former Warner cartoon director [[Bob Clampett]] was hired to catalog the Warner cartoon library.\n\n==Film archive==\nIn 1969, the United Artists Corporation presented to the [[Library of Congress]] the earliest surviving preprint material from the pre-1950 film library of Warner Bros. (including [[First National Pictures|First National]] library). The collection contains 200 silent features (1918\u201329), 800 sound features (1926\u201350), 1,800 sound shorts (1926\u201348), and 337 ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts (1931\u201348). While consisting largely of Warner Bros. releases, the collection includes nearly two hundred sound features released by Monogram Pictures Corporation between 1936 and 1946 and 231 ''Popeye'' cartoons produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] released between 1933 and 1957. Most motion pictures exist in the original black-and-white/Technicolor camera negatives. The Library is converting the nitrate film to safety stock and has obtained reference prints for seventy of the better known Warner Bros. features, such as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'' (1935), ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932), ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), and ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1930). There are no [[United Artists]] films (such as ''[[James Bond]]'' and ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' franchise; these are owned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]) in the United Artists Collection. The early synchronized sound [[Vitaphone]] shorts are lacking accompanying sound discs.\n\nThis is a large collection of nitrate negatives and masters, which are still undergoing transfer to acetate stock. Most of the safety film copies exist only in the preservation master stage, limiting accessibility for viewing and duplication. Some years ago, LC obtained 16mm prints (though many are television prints, flat in picture quality and occasionally edited) for pre-1950 Warner Bros. features (among the most popular of all American films). Additional prints have been added to the collection, ranging from \"reject fine grain master positives\" (copies made for preservation but deemed inadequate) suitable for reference use, to high-quality 35mm prints reserved for theatrical projection. United Artists also donated 16mm prints of most of the Warner Bros. and Monogram films to the [[Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research]], such as ''[[My Four Years in Germany]]'' (1918),<ref>[https://archive.is/20160320105027/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wcftr/filmlist/title.asp?film_id=34461 My Four Years in Germany (1918)] </ref> ''[[Conductor 1492]]'' (1924), ''[[Midnight Lovers (1926 film)|Midnight Lovers]]'' (1926) and ''[[Joe Palooka in Triple Cross]]'' (1951).\n\nTitles and holdings are listed in the various M/B/RS catalogs. There are a number of published reference books on Warner Bros. films.<ref>''Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress'' by The American Film Institute, c. 1978.</ref> Copyrights are still in effect for most of the films in this collection; a donor restriction also applies. United Artists has passed through various hands, but current ownership of this material resides with Turner Entertainment Co.\n\n==Ownership of properties==\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] purchased United Artists (along with the a.a.p. library) from [[Transamerica Corporation]] in 1981 and became [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#MGM/UA Entertainment|MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]]\n\nThe rights to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1948 film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', originally distributed by Warner Bros. (with MGM) and later copyrighted by UATV, reverted to the director in 1968. Distribution rights were later acquired by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1983.\n\n[[Turner Broadcasting System]] (via [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]) took over the library in 1986 after [[Ted Turner]]'s short-lived ownership of MGM/UA. When Turner sold back the MGM/UA production unit, he kept the MGM library, including select portions of the a.a.p. library (limited to the Warner Bros. films and the ''Popeye'' cartoons), for his own company. The 1936\u20131946 Monogram films were not included with the purchase, and thus some of these films remain with MGM.\n\nThe Warner Bros. film libraries were reunited when Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]), the studio's parent company since the 1990 merger of [[Time Inc.]] and [[Warner Communications]] (formerly [[Kinney National Company]]), bought Turner in 1996. Turner remains the copyright owner in name only to the former Associated Artists Productions properties, while WarnerMedia handles their distribution.\n\nUA originally leased video rights to their library (including the a.a.p. library) to [[Magnetic Video]], the first home video company. Magnetic Video was sold to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1982, becoming 20th Century-Fox Video. In 1982, Fox and [[CBS]] formed [[CBS/Fox Video]], which continued to distribute the UA/a.a.p. library under license from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] until the rights reverted to MGM/UA. After Turner's purchase of the MGM/UA library, MGM/UA Home Video continued to distribute the films on video under license until 1999. MGM/UA paid Time Warner US$225 million to end their contract of distributing the Associated Artists Productions library early.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-mar-16-fi-17731-story.html|title=MGM Buys Its Way Out of Pact for $225 Million|last=Bates|first=James|access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref> The rights to distribute were then transferred to [[Warner Home Video]] in 2000. Laboratory in Brooklyn to Consolidated Labs in N.J. thus avoiding the New York sales tax on the purchase. Subsequently the negatives were split up between several labs in the NY area including DuArt, Mercury, Deluxe and CFI. Each lab made new acetate 16mm internegatives and re-recorded sound tracks. Some of the color films were in Technicolor and, as was Technicolor's policy, they held the 3 color negatives and mage prints. TV stations used 16mm prints for their telecasting and each lab made the prints for the titles they held.\n\nThese same prints would be the ones used on pre-1999 VHS and laserdisc releases of former a.a.p.-owned films. The a.a.p. versions of these films were also later used for cable television broadcasts (even as recently as March 2011, a.a.p. prints of WB cartoons have been seen on TV). Early releases of WB films released between 1918\u20131931 bore an a.a.p. copyright renewal notice, since these renewals came before the UA purchase, however those copyrights have since been reassigned to Turner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/v-title-database/lone/little-caesar-rca-2.html|title=Little Caesar : RCA&#93; {76476034122} U - Side 2 - CED Title - Blu-ray DVD Movie Precursor|publisher=Cedmagic.com|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Turner began removing the a.a.p. logos from many of the films (although this process started before that by both UA and local television stations). With the a.a.p. logos being removed, Turner also began creating \"dubbed versions\" that same year, which are available in American and European formats and most had altered ending cards and color borders in the opening titles for the print given, which they kept, for the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons. These \"dubbed\" prints attempted to make the material look better with whatever prints they had access to, though some ended up looking worse. One hundred twenty-three of the Warner Bros. cartoons purchased by a.a.p. were restored from their original negatives for inclusion in Warner Home Video's series of six ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' DVD box sets. Several more WB cartoons formerly owned by a.a.p. have been restored for other ''Looney Tunes'' DVD releases since 2010. The black and white ''Popeye'' cartoons (and the three ''Color Specials'') were also restored from their original negatives for a series of three ''[[Popeye the Sailor (film series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' DVD sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd|title=Popeye DVD|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=August 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130353/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd-2993.html|archivedate=December 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n* a.a.p.

It re-released a number of films from the pre-1950 WB library, as well as a number of [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British films]] which a.a.p. bought the rights to. Dominant also sold and/or leased 16mm prints of WB library titles to non-theatrical rental libraries. The subsidiary was later folded into UA's main theatrical distribution arm after the company was sold to UA. Some pre-1931 WB library is considered lost.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Animated television series created for syndication}}\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Popeye}}\n{{Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoons}}\n\n[[Category:Film distributors of the United States]]\n[[Category:Television syndication distributors]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1948]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 1958]]\n[[Category:1958 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:1948 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1958 disestablishments in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "El C", "label": "safe", "comment": "{{pp-sock|small=yes}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Artists_Productions"}

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as

It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was J.T. Walsh's final performance and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers David and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow, popular and outgoing, while the introverted David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950\u2019s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David\u2019s knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers\u2019 living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television, but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show\u2019s characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town \u2013 fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion and foreign concepts such as books, fire and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces sex to her peers, many of her classmates go to Lover's Lane to engage in sex, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill\u2019s interest in painting. After learning of sex and [[masturbation]] from Jennifer, Betty pleasures herself while bathing and, upon reaching orgasm, sees color and eventually becomes \"colored\" herself. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged, led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville\u2019s values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill\u2019s nude painting of Betty, done on his malt shop window. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is nearly raped by non-colored teenage boys. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his twin sister, his new girlfriend and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.

The black-and-white-meets-color world portrayed in the movie was filmed entirely in color; in all, approximately 163,000 frames of 35&nbsp;mm footage were scanned, in order to selectively desaturate and adjust contrast digitally. The scanning was done in Los Angeles by [[Cinesite]], utilizing a [[Spirit DataCine]] for scanning at [[2K resolution]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Bob |date=November 1998 |title=Black & white in color |journal=American Cinematographer |url=http://www.theasc.com/protect/nov98/pleasantville/pg1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108113445/http://www.theasc.com/protect/nov98/pleasantville/pg1.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 |page=1 |quote=Watts suggested using the Philips Spirit DataCine at Cinesite Digital Imaging in Los Angeles for converting the film to data. }} ([http://www.theasc.com/protect/nov98/pleasantville/index.htm full article link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419081453/http://www.theasc.com/protect/nov98/pleasantville/index.htm# |date=2015-04-19 }})</ref> and a MegaDef Colour Correction System from [[Pandora International]].\n\nCameraman Brent Hershman's death, when he fell asleep driving home after a 19-hour workday on the set of the film, resulted in a wrongful death suit, claiming that New Line Cinema, New Line Productions and Juno Pix Inc. were responsible for the death as a result of the lengthy work hours imposed on the set.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/05/how-long-are-the-days-on-a-movie-set-polone.html | title=Polone: The Unglamorous, Punishing Hours of Working on a Hollywood Set | work=Vulture | date=May 23, 2012 | accessdate=August 6, 2013 |last1=Polone |first1=Gavin  |authorlink1=Gavin Polone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/21/local/me-995 | title=Death After Long Workday Spurs Suit | work=Los Angeles Times | date=December 21, 1997 | accessdate=August 6, 2013 |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ann W.}}</ref>\n\nThe film is dedicated to Hershman, as well as to director Ross's mother, Gail, and actor J.

Over 30,000 people entered. The winner, who remained anonymous, declined the trip and opted to receive the $10,000 cash prize instead.\n\n==Themes==\nDirector Gary Ross stated, \"This movie is  about the fact that personal repression gives rise to larger political oppression...That when we're afraid of certain things in ourselves or we're afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a lot of very ugly social situations can develop.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson-Ott |first=Edward |date=1998 |title=Pleasantville (1998) |publisher=imdb.com |url=https://www.imdb.com/reviews/149/14904.html |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRobert Beuka says in his book ''SuburbiaNation'', \"'' Pleasantville'' is a morality tale concerning the values of contemporary suburban America by holding that social landscape up against both the Utopian and the dystopian visions of suburbia that emerged in the 1950s.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Beuka |first=Robert |date=2004 |title=SuburbiaNation: Reading Suburban Landscape in Twentieth-Century American Fiction and Film |edition=1st |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9781403963673 |pages=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\nRobert McDaniel of ''[[Film & History]]'' described the town as the perfect place, \"It never rains, the highs and lows rest at 72 degrees, the fire department exists only to rescue treed cats, and the basketball team never misses the hoop.\" However, McDaniel says, \"Pleasantville is a false hope.

It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was J.T. Walsh's final performance and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers David and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow, popular and outgoing, while the introverted David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950\u2019s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David\u2019s knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers\u2019 living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television, but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show\u2019s characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town \u2013 fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion and foreign concepts such as books, fire and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces sex to her peers, many of her classmates go to Lover's Lane to engage in sex, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill\u2019s interest in painting. After learning of sex and [[masturbation]] from Jennifer, Betty pleasures herself while bathing and, upon reaching orgasm, sees color and eventually becomes \"colored\" herself. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged, led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville\u2019s values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill\u2019s nude painting of Betty, done on his malt shop window. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is nearly raped by non-colored teenage boys. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his twin sister, his new girlfriend and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.
