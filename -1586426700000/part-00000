He may have been consecrated by either [[Ambrose]] of [[Milan]] or Valerian (Valerianus) of Aquileia. Ambrose donated the episcopal insignia and showed a paternal solicitude for Vigilius. As bishop, Vigilius attempted to convert [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[paganism|pagans]] to Nicene [[Christianity]] and is said to have founded thirty parishes in his diocese. He is traditionally regarded as the founder of the [[Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento| Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Trent]]. A letter attributed to Ambrose encourages Vigilius to oppose marriages between Christians and pagans.<ref name=\"CE\"/> Vigilius also preached in [[Brescia]] and [[Verona]], which lay outside of his diocese.\n\nHis companions during his missions were Saints Sisinnius, Martyrius and Alexander, who were sent by Ambrose to assist Vigilius.<ref name=\"santi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/59600|title=San Vigilio|date=February 1, 2001|publisher=Santie Beati|accessdate=October 17, 2008}}</ref>  Tradition makes these three natives of [[Cappadocia]]. A work called ''De Martyrio SS. Sisinnii, Martyrii et Alexandri'' is attributed to Vigilius.<ref name=\"CE\"/>\n\nSisinnius, Martyrius and Alexander (''Sisinio, Martirio e Alessandro'') were killed at [[Sanzeno]] after they attempted to convert the local population there to Christianity. Vigilius forgave their killers and had the remains of the three men sent to John Chrysostom in [[Constantinople]], as well to [[Simplician]], Ambrose's successor, in Milan. Milan would later give some of those relics back to Sanzeno in the 20th century, where they rest in the Basilica dei Ss. Martiri dell'Anaunia.<ref name=\"santi\"/>\n\nVigilius is associated with the legend of [[Romedius|St. Romedius]], who is often depicted alongside or astride a [[bear]].

Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.<ref name=\"Population and poverty\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations \u2014 for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].\n\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].\n\n=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===\n\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging. Use of the term \"market\" instead of \"country\" usually indicates specific focus on the characteristics of the countries' [[capital market]]s as opposed to the overall economy.\n\n* [[Developed country|Developed countries]] and [[developed market]]s\n* Developing countries include in decreasing order of economic growth or size of the capital market:\n** [[Newly industrialized country|Newly industrialized countries]]<ref name=\"Globalization\">{{cite book|title=Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy | first = Pawe\u0142 | last = Bo\u017cyk | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7546-4638-9|chapter=Newly Industrialized Countries}}</ref><ref name=\"Limits\">{{cite book|title=The Limits of Convergence| first = Mauro F. | last = Guill\u00e9n | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-691-11633-4|chapter=Multinationals, Ideology, and Organized Labor|author-link=Mauro F.

Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.<ref name=\"Population and poverty\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations \u2014 for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].\n\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].\n\n=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===\n\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging.

(CMOC) for $2.65 billion in cash and possibly more if the average copper price rose enough to trigger the increase in the following 24 months. TF Holdings was a Bermuda [[holding company]] with indirect ownership of 80% of [[Tenke Fungurume Mine]]. Since FCX had owned 70% ownership of TF Holdings, the sale gave China Molybdenum a 56% interest in Tenke Fungurume Mine.

The company responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and \"his cronies\", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.<ref name=waste>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/international/asia/27gold.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Below a Mountain of Wealth, a River of Waste | first1=Jane | last1=Perlez | first2=Raymond | last2=Bonner | date=December 27, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe Grasberg mine's tailings \"severely impacted\" more than {{convert|11|sqmi|km2|0}} of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.<ref name=spinninggold/> The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimated that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock\u2014a great part of which generates [[acid]]\u2014will be dumped into the local river system.
