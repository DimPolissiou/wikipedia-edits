Apart from minor technical alterations, mainly to accommodate the new generation of engines, the external design received a facelift to give the buses a less angular look, with internal panelling altered accordingly. Production of the old model ceased by autumn 2006.\n\nIn 2006 the Citaro received a much more substantial facelift, which can be seen from the outside by a revised front and rear design (analogous to the recently introduced low-entry buses). The hitherto characteristic feature of the first series, the \"washboard trim\" on the front of the vehicle, which was also available as a front advertising area and smooth surface without Mercedes star, accounted for a somewhat rounded front baffle.

However, all models are available with either version.\n\nOther customizations include the number and type of doors as well as the internal layout. Two types of seats are offered as part of the standard range, again with a basic model for urban use and an enhanced version for longer-distance routes, although both also are available on all models.\n\nAside from the usual [[diesel engine]]s, the Citaro is also available with a powerful [[Euro IV]] [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]] engine (model M&nbsp;447&nbsp;hLAG) rated at 185&nbsp;kW (252&nbsp;PS) or 240&nbsp;kW (326&nbsp;PS) - the latter rating used mainly for interurban and articulated buses or standard-length city buses operating in areas with a hilly topography. These engines are also optionally available with [[Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle|Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle]] (EEV) certification, meaning that their emission levels are lower than even the most stringent [[European Union]] emissions standards.\n\n===Non-standard bodies===\n[[File:Mercedes irvine citaro sst.JPG|thumb|Irvine-Citaro of \u00dcSTRA [[Hannover]]]]\nAs a one-off, German operators [[\u00fcstra]] of [[Hanover]] and [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe|LVB]] of [[Leipzig]] took delivery of a batch of Citaros bodied to a special design by [[James Irvine (designer)|James Irvine]] for [[Expo 2000]]. Leipzig's vehicles were lent to Hanover for the duration of the exhibition, but subsequently returned to normal service in their home city. All other Citaros bodied by Mercedes-Benz were to standard designs, however a number of chassis were bodied by independent manufacturers, most notably [[Carrosserie Hess|Hess]] of Switzerland. However, the Citaro has more recently only been sold as a complete product.\n\nIn 2007 the workshops of the [[Szeged]] (Hungary) bus operator SZKT converted a regular Citaro to a trolleybus. As of April 2010, five such buses are already serving as a trolley and more examples are in preparation in the near future.<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB-7K4N7PtI Mercedes-Benz Citaro trolley in Szeged].

About 35 of these buses have been in service in a variety of different world cities in order to [[Fuel cell bus trial|test the feasibility of hydrogen fuel cells]] in different operating circumstances and different conditions, especially weather conditions.\n\n===Hybrid electric version===\nThe Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a [[hybrid electric bus|series-hybrid]] [[articulated bus]] with a compact 450&nbsp;kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8-litre, 160&nbsp;kW, Euro&nbsp;4 OM-924LA diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4&nbsp;kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, and four 80&nbsp;kW electric wheel [[hub motor]]s located on the centre and rear axles. (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12-litre, 1,000&nbsp;kg.) The battery pack is also charged by [[regenerative braking]] (recuperation).

Instead, in 2017, they launched '''Citaro Hybrid''' variants of diesel and CNG Citaro, which uses [[mild hybrid]] drive, much cheaper to manufacture than ''BlueTec Hybrid'' drive. It uses 14 kW, disc-shaped electric motor mounted between combustion engine and transmission for energy recuperation and can provide a torque of up to 220 Nm.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.mercedes-benz-bus.com/en_GB/models/citaro-hybrid/efficiency/hybrid-technology.html |title= ''Citaro hybrid: Hybrid technology'' |publisher= Mercedes-Benz Buses and Coaches UK |access-date= 2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery version / eCitaro===\n[[File:ASEAG 999.jpg|thumb|A battery-powered Citaro G 1st generation facelift operated by ASEAG Aachen]]\nSince 2015, [[Aachen]] Transport runs a battery-powered Citaro articulated bus as a test in scheduled operation. The vehicle was converted in 2014 from a hybrid bus to a battery bus. They removed all diesel components and installed 1300 traction batteries with a total capacity of approximately 180 kWh. The axle loads remained unchanged. The vehicle has four wheel hub motors with 60&nbsp;kW continuous power on the second and third axle and has a range of more than 50 kilometers. The conversion was carried out as part of the EU project Civitas (Cleaner and better transport in cities) and was funded by the Aachen Transport Association to 75 percent. The costs for the hardware (e.g. batteries) amounted to approximately 700,000 euros.\n\nMercedes-Benz tested prototypes of the Citaro with full electric drive. The bus features a modular battery pack design and use the same electric wheel hub motors as the Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid.

This is expected to save on spare parts inventory - this can be done together with the same diesel buses of the dispenser series - as well as lower acquisition costs compared to standard production trolleybuses. The modified type designation is O-530 Tr12, the six wagons bear the operating numbers T-860 to T-865.\n\nIn 2012, two Citaro trolleybuses also went into operation in Polish [[Gdynia]].

Apart from minor technical alterations, mainly to accommodate the new generation of engines, the external design received a facelift to give the buses a less angular look, with internal panelling altered accordingly. Production of the old model ceased by autumn 2006.\n\nIn 2006 the Citaro received a much more substantial facelift, which can be seen from the outside by a revised front and rear design (analogous to the recently introduced low-entry buses). The hitherto characteristic feature of the first series, the \"washboard trim\" on the front of the vehicle, which was also available as a front advertising area and smooth surface without Mercedes star, accounted for a somewhat rounded front baffle.

However, all models are available with either version.\n\nOther customizations include the number and type of doors as well as the internal layout. Two types of seats are offered as part of the standard range, again with a basic model for urban use and an enhanced version for longer-distance routes, although both also are available on all models.\n\nAside from the usual [[diesel engine]]s, the Citaro is also available with a powerful [[Euro IV]] [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]] engine (model M&nbsp;447&nbsp;hLAG) rated at 185&nbsp;kW (252&nbsp;PS) or 240&nbsp;kW (326&nbsp;PS) - the latter rating used mainly for interurban and articulated buses or standard-length city buses operating in areas with a hilly topography. These engines are also optionally available with [[Enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle|Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle]] (EEV) certification, meaning that their emission levels are lower than even the most stringent [[European Union]] emissions standards.\n\n===Non-standard bodies===\n[[File:Mercedes irvine citaro sst.JPG|thumb|Irvine-Citaro of \u00dcSTRA [[Hannover]]]]\nAs a one-off, German operators [[\u00fcstra]] of [[Hanover]] and [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe|LVB]] of [[Leipzig]] took delivery of a batch of Citaros bodied to a special design by [[James Irvine (designer)|James Irvine]] for [[Expo 2000]]. Leipzig's vehicles were lent to Hanover for the duration of the exhibition, but subsequently returned to normal service in their home city. All other Citaros bodied by Mercedes-Benz were to standard designs, however a number of chassis were bodied by independent manufacturers, most notably [[Carrosserie Hess|Hess]] of Switzerland. However, the Citaro has more recently only been sold as a complete product.\n\nIn 2007 the workshops of the [[Szeged]] (Hungary) bus operator SZKT converted a regular Citaro to a trolleybus. As of April 2010, five such buses are already serving as a trolley and more examples are in preparation in the near future.<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB-7K4N7PtI Mercedes-Benz Citaro trolley in Szeged].

About 35 of these buses have been in service in a variety of different world cities in order to [[Fuel cell bus trial|test the feasibility of hydrogen fuel cells]] in different operating circumstances and different conditions, especially weather conditions.\n\n===Hybrid electric version===\nThe Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a [[hybrid electric bus|series-hybrid]] [[articulated bus]] with a compact 450&nbsp;kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8-litre, 160&nbsp;kW, Euro&nbsp;4 OM-924LA diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4&nbsp;kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, and four 80&nbsp;kW electric wheel [[hub motor]]s located on the centre and rear axles. (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12-litre, 1,000&nbsp;kg.) The battery pack is also charged by [[regenerative braking]] (recuperation).

Instead, in 2017, they launched '''Citaro Hybrid''' variants of diesel and CNG Citaro, which uses [[mild hybrid]] drive, much cheaper to manufacture than ''BlueTec Hybrid'' drive. It uses 14 kW, disc-shaped electric motor mounted between combustion engine and transmission for energy recuperation and can provide a torque of up to 220 Nm.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.mercedes-benz-bus.com/en_GB/models/citaro-hybrid/efficiency/hybrid-technology.html |title= ''Citaro hybrid: Hybrid technology'' |publisher= Mercedes-Benz Buses and Coaches UK |access-date= 2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery version / eCitaro===\n[[File:ASEAG 999.jpg|thumb|A battery-powered Citaro G 1st generation facelift operated by ASEAG Aachen]]\nSince 2015, [[Aachen]] Transport runs a battery-powered Citaro articulated bus as a test in scheduled operation. The vehicle was converted in 2014 from a hybrid bus to a battery bus. They removed all diesel components and installed 1300 traction batteries with a total capacity of approximately 180 kWh. The axle loads remained unchanged. The vehicle has four wheel hub motors with 60&nbsp;kW continuous power on the second and third axle and has a range of more than 50 kilometers. The conversion was carried out as part of the EU project Civitas (Cleaner and better transport in cities) and was funded by the Aachen Transport Association to 75 percent. The costs for the hardware (e.g. batteries) amounted to approximately 700,000 euros.\n\nMercedes-Benz tested prototypes of the Citaro with full electric drive. The bus features a modular battery pack design and use the same electric wheel hub motors as the Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid.

This is expected to save on spare parts inventory - this can be done together with the same diesel buses of the dispenser series - as well as lower acquisition costs compared to standard production trolleybuses. The modified type designation is O-530 Tr12, the six wagons bear the operating numbers T-860 to T-865.\n\nIn 2012, two Citaro trolleybuses also went into operation in Polish [[Gdynia]].

He won his first international tournament in his teens, winning gold at the 2001 I.F.M.A. European Championships.  He followed this up two years later aged just 17 by winning a gold medal in the 61 [[kg]] category at the 2003 I.A.M.T.F. World Championships in [[Bangkok, Thailand]].  Between 2004 and 2008 Vitaly would win four gold medals at the W.M.F. world championships (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007) along with a gold medal at the 2004 W.K.P.F. World Championships and gold at the 2006 [[World Association of Kickboxing Organizations|W.A.K.O.]] European Championships.\n\nIn 2008 Vitaly entered the 4th Busan [[TAFISA]] World Games in [[Busan, South Korea]] which was holding the 2008 I.F.M.A. World Championship.  He made the final but had to make do with silver \u2013 losing his final match to the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Petr Nakonechnyi]].  He returned with a vengeance the following year winning the 2009 I.F.M.A. European Championship and the 2009 I.F.M.A. World Championship.  At the world championship Vitaly defeated [[Marcus \u00d6berg]] in the quarter finals before gaining his revenge on Nakonechnyi in the semi finals en route to winning gold.  At the I.F.M.A. world championships in 2010, Vitaly made it through to the final but lost in the gold medal match, although he would win gold earlier on in the year at the I.F.M.A. European Championships in Italy.  So far in his amateur career he has nine medals at World championships (seven gold, two silver) and three golds at European championships from 61 [[kg]] through to his current weight of 71 [[kg]].\n\nOn July 30, 2017 Gurkov became the first 75&nbsp;kg Muay Thai [[Muay Thai at the 2017 World Games|Gold-medalist]]at [[The World Games]] 2017 in [[2017 World Games|Wroclaw]], Poland.<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Iskenderov\n | first = Parviz\n | author-link = Parviz Iskenderov\n | title = Muay Thai at The World Games \u2013 final results\n | website = Fightmag\n | date = July 31, 2017\n | url = http://www.fightmag.com.au/2017/07/31/muay-thai-world-games-final-results/\n | access-date = July 31, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n[[File:Buakaw vs Vitaly 2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Against [[Buakaw Por.Pramuk]] at THAI FIGHT 2012 final]]\n\nAs a result of his successful amateur career, Gurkov has increasingly become involved in professional competitions.

Metal buildings were damaged, and outbuildings were destroyed as well. A house along Matthews Road had much of its roof torn off, and a nearby vehicle was rolled down a hill and badly mangled. After crossing [[Mississippi Highway 15]] and entering [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], the tornado intensified back to low-end EF4 intensity as it struck the community of [[Moss, Mississippi|Moss]], where nearly every structure in town was damaged and numerous homes were destroyed. Several of these homes were flattened with only piles of rubble remaining, and one was left with only a single closet standing. Half of the First Baptist Church was leveled, and a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and completely destroyed. Continuing northeast of Moss, the tornado began to weaken, producing EF1 to EF2 damage. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles, including some along Interstate 59 between the [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]] and Vossburg exits. Barns and outbuildings were destroyed along this segment of the path, and some power poles were snapped.

It first touched down along Price Road in [[Lawrence County, Mississippi]], east-southeast of the small community of [[Topeka, Mississippi|Topeka]]. Damage at the beginning of the path consisted of a few trees uprooted at EF0 strength. The tornado continued to the northeast, reaching EF2 intensity as it crossed Given Road, where a large swath of trees was flattened. EF2 damage continued to the northeast, with many large trees snapped and uprooted. A house along Rayborn Lane sustained EF1 roof damage, and two nearby sheds were damaged as well. The tornado strengthened further and reached EF3 strength as it moved through a wooded area near the [[Pearl River]], where numerous trees were snapped and partially debarked. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado passed northeast of [[Oak Vale, Mississippi|Oak Vale]] where some homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss, numerous trees were snapped, a metal building was destroyed, and damage was rated EF2 to EF3. Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off. EF2 damage continued to the northeast of Carson, where several mobile homes were destroyed, another house had its roof ripped off, and multiple other homes sustained less severe roof damage.<ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nCrossing [[Mississippi Highway 35]], the tornado again attained EF3 strength as the James Hill Church was completely leveled, a nearby home sustained collapse of its exterior walls, and trees were denuded and partially debarked. Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]]. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued along the remainder of the path and through the rural community of [[Paulding, Mississippi|Paulding]] until the tornado dissipated along County Road 31 to the south of [[Rose Hill, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"JAN_0412\" /><ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nRemaining on the ground for {{convert|84.1|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}, this was the longest tracked-tornado of the outbreak.

It quickly strengthened and impacted an industrial area on the south side of [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]] at EF1 strength, damaging multiple businesses along [[Georgia State Highway 2|SR 2]]. A weather station at the Public Works Department measured an unconfirmed gust of {{convert|106|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Thereafter, the tornado weakened back to an EF0 and produced weak, sporadic tree and structural damage to a few homes as it skipped northeast. It then crossed [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|Intersate 75]] before moving into [[Tennessee]].<ref name=\"FFC_0415\"/> The tornado then strengthened to EF1 strength again as it impacted the Harris Hills area, uprooting trees. It then rapidly reached its peak intensity of EF3 as entered the Bella Vista Acres area, causing significant roof damage to several structures. An auto-parts store in the area was leveled and a restaurant on the end of a large shopping building had its facade ripped off a restaurant and its roofed peeled back. As the tornado continued northeast, a [[tornado emergency]] was issued for [[Collegedale, Tennessee|Collegedale]] and [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]]. The tornado then reached its widest part of the as it entered the Drake Forest neighborhood while still at EF3 intensity. Widespread damage to structures occurred here as homes, roofs, and trees sustained significant damage. EF2 to EF3 damage continued through the Holly Hills neighborhood where additional trees were snapped, power poles were downed, and homes sustained significant damage. The tornado then abruptly narrowed and weakened back to EF1 strength as it moved directly into [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]] and hit the Integra Hills Preserve Apartments, where many homes sustained roof damage.
