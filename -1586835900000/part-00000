It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves. See [[Jimmy Doolittle]].-->\n\nSixteen [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25B Mitchell]] medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} deep in the Western Pacific Ocean, each with a crew of five men. The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]]. The consequences were most severely felt in China, where [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign|Japanese reprisals]] caused the deaths of 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"hist reex\" />\n\nDoolittle initially believed that the loss of all his aircraft would lead to his court-martial, but he instead received the [[Medal of Honor]] and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.\n\n== Background ==\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in a meeting at the [[White House]] on 21 December 1941 and said that Japan should be bombed as soon as possible to boost public morale after Pearl Harbor.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 10.</ref> Doolittle recounted in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership. \"An attack on the Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders.\u2026 Americans badly needed a morale boost.\"<ref>Doolittle and Glines 1991, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolittle Raider, Plane 1.jpg|thumb|Crew No. 1 in front of B-25#40-2344 on the deck of {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, 18 April 1942.

Leonard, flight engineer/gunner.]]\nThe concept for the attack came from Navy Captain [[Francis S. Low]], Assistant Chief of Staff for antisubmarine warfare. He reported to Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days. On 6 April 1942, six Mitchells bombed [[Gasmata]], [[New Britain]]. This was followed on 12 and 13 April by two days of attacks against [[Cebu City]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the Philippines.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission. On 19 February, the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force and officially assigned to [[III Bomber Command]].<ref>Craven and Cate 1948, p. 614.</ref>\n\nInitial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission,<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.</ref> and 24 of the group's B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the [[Mid-Continent Airlines]] modification center in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt. [[Charles Ross Greening|C. Ross Greening]] dubbed the \"Mark Twain\". The materials for this bombsight cost only 20 cents.<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\" />\n\nTwo bombers also had cameras mounted to record the results of the bombing.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nThe 24 crews were selected and picked up the modified bombers in Minneapolis and flew them to [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida, beginning 1 March 1942. There, the crews received concentrated training for three weeks in simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low-altitude bombing, and over-water navigation, operating primarily out of [[Wagner Field|Eglin Auxiliary Field #1]], a more secluded site. [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Henry L. Miller, a [[U.S. Navy]] flight instructor from nearby [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch.

Fifteen made up the mission force and the 16th, by last-minute agreement with the Navy, was loaded so that it could be launched shortly after departure from San Francisco to demonstrate to the Army pilots that there was sufficient deck space for a safe takeoff. Instead, that bomber was made part of the mission force.{{refn|1st Lt. Richard Joyce was to have flown this aircraft back to the mainland with Navy Lieut. Miller as his copilot.

Meanwhile, Soviet forces had gained the strategic initiative in Europe. Even if the Americans' \"escape\" managed to gain significant attention in Tokyo, it was by then thought extremely unlikely that Japan would respond with any sort of military retaliation.\n\nDoolittle and his crew, after parachuting into China, received assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians, as well as [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], an American [[missionary]] in China.

Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean. On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced that they had tried the eight prisoners and sentenced them all to death, but said several had received commutation of their sentences to life imprisonment.

Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier [[staff sergeant|S/Sgt.]] [[William John Dieter|William J. Dieter]] and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E.

Embassy staff were \"very happy and proud\" and the British said that they \"drank toasts all day to the American flyers\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Grew |first= Joseph C |title= Ten Years in Japan |url= https://archive.org/details/tenyearsinjapanc0000grew |url-access= registration |year= 1944 |publisher= Simon and Schuster |location= New York |pages= [https://archive.org/details/tenyearsinjapanc0000grew/page/526 526], 527 }}</ref> Sir [[Robert Craigie (diplomat)|Robert Craigie]], GCMG, the interned [[British Ambassador to Japan]] who was under house arrest in Tokyo at the time, said that Japanese staff had been amused at the embassy's air raid precautions as the idea of an attack on Tokyo was \"laughable\" with the Allies in retreat, but the guards now showed \"considerable excitement and perturbation.\" Several false alarms followed, and in poorer districts people rushed into the streets shouting and gesticulating, losing their normal \"iron control\" over their emotions and showing a \"tendency to panic\". The police guards on Allied and neutral missions were doubled to foil xenophobic attacks; and the guard on the German mission was tripled.<ref>{{cite book |last= Craigie |first= Robertt |title= Behind the Japanese Mask |year= 1945 |publisher= Hutchinson & Co |location= London |pages= 146, 147 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the minimal damage inflicted, American morale, still reeling from the attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan's subsequent territorial gains, soared when news of the raid was released.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 219.</ref> The Japanese press was told to describe the attack as a cruel, indiscriminate bombing against civilians, including women and children. After the war, the casualty count was 87 dead, 151 serious injuries, and more than 311 minor injuries; children were among those killed, and newspapers asked their parents to share their opinion on how the captured raiders should be treated.<ref name=Scott-18 />\n\nThe Japanese Navy attempted to locate and pursue the American task force. The [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Second Fleet]], its main striking force, was near [[Formosa]], returning from the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] to refit and replace its air losses. Spearheaded by five aircraft carriers and its best naval aircraft and aircrews, the Second Fleet was immediately ordered to locate and destroy the U.S. carrier force, but failed to do so.<ref>Glines 1988, pp. 75\u201376.</ref><ref>Craven and Cate 1948, p. 441.</ref> Nagumo and his staff on ''Akagi'' heard that an American force was near Japan but expected an attack on the next day. [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] and [[Shigeyoshi Miwa]] considered the \"one-way\" raid \"excellent strategy\", with the bombers evading Army fighters by flying \"much lower than anticipated\". Kuroshima said the raid \"passed like a shiver over Japan\" and Miwa criticised the Army for claiming to have shot down nine aircraft rather than \"not even one\".{{sfn|Prange|1982|p=25}}\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy also bore a special responsibility for allowing an American aircraft carrier force to approach the Japanese Home Islands in a manner similar to the IJN fleet to Hawaii in 1941, and permitting it to escape undamaged.{{refn|The Japanese, through a small amount of intercepted radio traffic between Halsey and Mitscher, were aware that an American carrier force was at large in the [[Western Pacific Ocean]] and could possibly attack Japan.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>}} The fact that medium, normally land-based bombers carried out the attack confused the IJN's high command.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the JuSAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. A quarter century later he followed up with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves. See [[Jimmy Doolittle]].-->\n\nSixteen [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25B Mitchell]] medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} deep in the Western Pacific Ocean, each with a crew of five men. The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]]. The consequences were most severely felt in China, where [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign|Japanese reprisals]] caused the deaths of 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"hist reex\" />\n\nDoolittle initially believed that the loss of all his aircraft would lead to his court-martial, but he instead received the [[Medal of Honor]] and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.\n\n== Background ==\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in a meeting at the [[White House]] on 21 December 1941 and said that Japan should be bombed as soon as possible to boost public morale after Pearl Harbor.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 10.</ref> Doolittle recounted in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership. \"An attack on the Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders.\u2026 Americans badly needed a morale boost.\"<ref>Doolittle and Glines 1991, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolittle Raider, Plane 1.jpg|thumb|Crew No. 1 in front of B-25#40-2344 on the deck of {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, 18 April 1942.

Leonard, flight engineer/gunner.]]\nThe concept for the attack came from Navy Captain [[Francis S. Low]], Assistant Chief of Staff for antisubmarine warfare. He reported to Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days. On 6 April 1942, six Mitchells bombed [[Gasmata]], [[New Britain]]. This was followed on 12 and 13 April by two days of attacks against [[Cebu City]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the Philippines. All of these were conducted by the [[3d Operations Group|3rd Bomb Group]], which staged 10 Mitchells through [[Darwin, Australia]] to [[Mindanao]].|group=Note}}<ref>Martin and Stephenson 2008, pp. 174, 182\u201383.</ref> but tests indicated that it could fulfill the mission's requirements.\n\nDoolittle's first report on the plan suggested that the bombers might land in [[Vladivostok]], shortening the flight by {{convert|600|nmi|km}} on the basis of turning over the B-25s as [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>Glines 1998, p. 27.</ref> Negotiations with the Soviet Union were fruitless for permission to land because it had signed a [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact|neutrality pact with Japan]] in April 1941.<ref name=\"doo\" /> China's [[Chiang Kai-shek]] agreed to the landing sites in China despite the concern of Japanese reprisals.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission. On 19 February, the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force and officially assigned to [[III Bomber Command]].<ref>Craven and Cate 1948, p. 614.</ref>\n\nInitial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission,<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.</ref> and 24 of the group's B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the [[Mid-Continent Airlines]] modification center in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt. [[Charles Ross Greening|C. Ross Greening]] dubbed the \"Mark Twain\". The materials for this bombsight cost only 20 cents.<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\" />\n\nTwo bombers also had cameras mounted to record the results of the bombing.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nThe 24 crews were selected and picked up the modified bombers in Minneapolis and flew them to [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida, beginning 1 March 1942. There, the crews received concentrated training for three weeks in simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low-altitude bombing, and over-water navigation, operating primarily out of [[Wagner Field|Eglin Auxiliary Field #1]], a more secluded site. [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Henry L. Miller, a [[U.S. Navy]] flight instructor from nearby [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch. For his efforts, Miller is considered an honorary member of the Raider group.<ref name=\"Joyce\">[http://www.doolittleraider.com/ \"Memorial site of Richard O. Joyce\"]. Doolittle Tokyo Raiders.

Fifteen made up the mission force and the 16th, by last-minute agreement with the Navy, was loaded so that it could be launched shortly after departure from San Francisco to demonstrate to the Army pilots that there was sufficient deck space for a safe takeoff. Instead, that bomber was made part of the mission force.{{refn|1st Lt. Richard Joyce was to have flown this aircraft back to the mainland with Navy Lieut. Miller as his copilot.

Meanwhile, Soviet forces had gained the strategic initiative in Europe. Even if the Americans' \"escape\" managed to gain significant attention in Tokyo, it was by then thought extremely unlikely that Japan would respond with any sort of military retaliation.\n\nDoolittle and his crew, after parachuting into China, received assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians, as well as [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], an American [[missionary]] in China.

Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean. On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced that they had tried the eight prisoners and sentenced them all to death, but said several had received commutation of their sentences to life imprisonment.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the JuSAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. A quarter century later he followed up with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.
