Farmer later spent nearly 30 years as a White Sox radio broadcaster.\n\n==Baseball career==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2020}}\nFarmer attended [[St. Rita of Cascia High School|St. Rita High School]] on the southwest side of [[Chicago]]. He was drafted by the Indians, in the fifth round of the [[1967 Major League Baseball draft|1967 Draft]].\n\nFarmer initially spent several seasons in MLB, with several organizations, and achieved varying degrees of success. However, his fortunes changed dramatically, following a mid-career injury. Eventually, Farmer \"re-invented\" himself, toiling three-plus years, spent mostly in the minor leagues.\n\nHis best seasons were with the Chicago White Sox, from 1979 to 1981. The White Sox acquired Farmer from the Rangers on June 15, 1979, along with [[Gary Holle]], in exchange for [[Eric Soderholm]].<ref name=\"miaminews\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9ZwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OukFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4757,4485159&dq=ed-farmer+baseball&hl=en|title=Baseball trade market busy at deadline|date=16 June 1979|work=[[The Miami News]]|page=2B|accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> He responded by recording 14 saves for the Sox, 13 of them coming after the All-Star break. A notable feud started between Farmer and [[Al Cowens]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]], early in the 1979 season.

The next season, on June 20\u201a 1980, while playing the [[Detroit Tigers]] at [[Comiskey Park]]\u201a with Farmer pitching, the now-Tiger Cowens hit a ground ball to shortstop. While Farmer watched his infielders make the play, Cowens ran to the mound and tackled the pitcher from behind instead of running to first base, landing several punches before the benches cleared and the two were separated.<ref name=\"hardballtimes.com\"/> MLB suspended Cowens for seven games and a warrant was issued for his arrest in Illinois\u201a forcing him to skip the remainder of the series. Later, Farmer agreed to drop the charges in exchange for a handshake\u201a and the two players brought out the lineup cards before the game on September 1. However, future appearances for Cowens at Comiskey were greeted by fans with a \"Coward Cowens\" banner.\n\nDespite the ongoing feud with Cowens, 1980 was Farmer's best year. He was selected to the American League [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team, when he compiled 18 saves prior to the break, and finished the season with career highs in saves (30) and wins (7). Farmer started only 21 games in his career; his other 349 appearances were out of the bullpen. In 370 total games, his career statistics include a 30\u201343 record, with a 4.28 [[Earned run average|ERA]], 395 [[strikeouts]], and 624 [[innings pitched]].
