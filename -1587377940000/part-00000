The scores achieved in these exams are considered very important for getting into universities, professional courses or training programmes and other occupations.\n\n==State Board Examinations==\nState board examinations are variously referred to as Madhyamik, Secondary State Certificate and Higher Secondary Certificate examinations. They are conducted and managed by education boards of different states in the country. They do not take place simultaneously due to the differences between syllabi and the examination itself. The examinations are generally held in the months of February and March, and the results are out in May and June.\n\nStudents have to apply for the examinations in November stating their personal details, subjects, and current educational status. Admit cards for the prescribed examination hall are received at the notified cell or their respective schools about 20\u201325 days prior to the commencement of the exam.\n\nExaminations are offered for various fields. Class 10th students give exam in five core subjects which are [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]]/[[Regional Language]], [[Mathematics]], [[Science]] and [[Social Studies]]. There is an option of choosing a sixth subject of you choice like [[Computer Science]], [[Information Technology]], [[Music]], [[Fine Arts]], [[Physical Education]], [[Foreign Languages]] etc. Class 12th students have to choose one out of the three streams offered in schools which are SCIENCE, COMMERCE and HUMANITIES.\n\nScience stream focuses on natural sciences and mathematics. The main subjects of this stream are [[English language|English]], [[Physics]] and [[Chemistry]] while students have to choose between [[Biology]] and [[Mathematics]]. They can choose both of them too. There are lots of vocational subjects offers by schools like [[Computer science]], [[Information technology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[food nutrition and dietetics]], [[biotechnology]], [[Economics]], [[Geography]], [[Web Application]] etc.\n  \nIn Commerce stream students are prepared for business, management, administration, trade and banking. The main subjects of this stream are [[English language|English]], [[Accountancy]], [[Economics]] and [[Business Studies]]. Vocational subjects like [[Marketing]], [[Retail]], [[Taxation]], [[Banking]], [[Entrepreneurship]], [[Geography]], [[History]],  [[Mathematics]] etc are offers by schools.\n\nIn Humanities students study social sciences and liberal arts. The main subjects of this stream are [[English language|English]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Political Science]] and [[Economics]](any 2/3 or all the 4 subjects depending upon the school). Vocational subjects like [[Mass Media]], [[Fashion Studies]], [[Legal Studies]], [[Psychology]], [[Tourism]], [[Beauty and Wellness]], [[Home Science]], [[Food nutrition and dietetics]], [[Sociology]], [[Philosophy]] etc are offers by schools. \n\n\nSchools also offer [[Hindi]] as a subject.

Security is usually high for these board examinations. The question papers are distributed by the overseeing board of education, and their contents are guarded closely until the exam begins. The examinations may include multiple sets of question papers as well. The candidates are issued identification passes in advance, which are presented to the staff at the examination site. The site itself must not be the same school where a candidate is from; to ensure impartiality, the candidate must travel to a different school to take the examination. For the same reason, the candidate may not identify himself/herself on the answer sheet except with an identity-masking number. Use of [[calculation]] aids other than [[logarithm]] tables, which are provided by the examination center, is prohibited.

The Council exists solely for educational purposes and not for purposes of profit.

A false roll no. is attached to the answer-sheet before evaluation. Once the answers have been evaluated, the identity numbers are matched to the actual roll no. (and identity) of the candidate. This is so that no bias takes place on part of the examiner regarding the background, name, appearance, religion or community of the candidate. The board then issues an official grade/score report for the exam to the candidate, as well as a [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|certificate]] of completion in the case of the HSC exam.

Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (Pre-marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, and he gets really angry, later he is convinced to eat biryani which later calms down his mood.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat. Nabeel later gets declined due to his demanding of a salary of 3-4 lakhs, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bubulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family travels to Dubai but without telling each other. Nabeel and Khoobsurat win a trip to Dubai from a lucky draw. Mehmood and Mumtaz go to Dubai for their honeymoon, with their own money. They happen to be booked into the same hotel. While wandering in the hall, Nabeel and Mehmood bump into each other; they pretend that they don't recognize each other and run back to their rooms. When both couples have intentions to go to the Oasis Mall, Mehmood sab and Nabeel both take showers in their rooms, Khoobsurat and Momo intend to wait for them in the hotel lobby and see each other openly on their approach to the elevator. \n\nMomo goes outside of the hotel to dodge Khoobsurat and races off in a taxi to some mall.  Khoobsurat, Nabeel, and Mehmood go out to find her. After they're reunited, they go to Ibn Battuta Mall the next day, where they meet FM radio producers and are proposed jobs that don't work out. Nabeel later meets a woman and starts flirting with her, and persuading her that he is wealthy, having many businesses. Mehmood sab finds out, and tries to stop Nabeel but fails. Afterward, the family headed towards the mall, Nabeel makes up excuses to go back to the hotel, so Mehmood sab drugs Nabeel's coffee cup to end his date.
