As the domain of [[Baekje]]  Kingdom expanded during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period, Gurye was absorbed as one of the kingdom's counties, where it was known as ''Gucharye'' (or ''Guchaji''). During the reign of [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]] (r. 742&ndash;65), the region was part of [[Gokseong|Gokseong County]], when it also attained its current name.<ref>''Statistical Yearbook'' 2007, p.25.</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\n* Flower : Royal Azaleas\n* Tree : Sansuyu tree\n* Bird : Pigeon\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Bus===\n\nAlthough Gurye is a small county, it is a tourist designated zone and often visited by Koreans year round.

It is on the south bank of the [[Geum River]] just upstream from its exit into the [[Yellow Sea]]. It has emerged as a high-tech manufacturing industrial city and an international trade seaport that is approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Seoul on the midwest coast of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]] is in the city. To encourage investment, a free trade zone has been declared in the area.\n\nNotable residents of Gunsan include actress [[Lee Eun-ju]], comedian [[Park Myeong-su]], and [[Teen Top]] member L.Joe. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Kunsan air base with F-16s.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kunsan Air Base]]]]\n\nGunsan was a small fishing village on the banks of the Geum River, near where the river spills into the Yellow Sea. It sits on the fertile western ''Honam'' plain where much rice is harvested. Gunsan became a port in the late 19th century largely due to pressure from the Japanese on the Koreans to ship rice to [[Japan]]. In 1899, Gunsan Port officially opened up to international trade. Gunsan City was largely settled by Japanese during the period of the Japanese occupation. The old (now demolished) City Hall and the Customs House are of Japanese construction. After liberation from the Japanese in 1945, Gunsan began to grow slowly.\n\nThe [[Korean War]] of the 1950s left the Gunsan area relatively unscathed. The initial drive south by the Communist North Koreans pushed the [[United Nations]] and South Korean forces toward [[Busan]] so quickly that Gunsan was spared from protracted fighting.\n\nNevertheless, a battalion of [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Korean Marines]], entrenched in the hills above Gunsan Port, withheld overwhelming communist forces. Their bravery created extra time for the evacuation of the town and port. The action is commemorated with a monument on the ridgeline where the heaviest fighting occurred. ({{coord|35|59|26|N|126|42|16|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:KR-45|name=(monument)}})\n\nThe drive north by the United Nations forces occurred so rapidly that there was little direct confrontation in the area. After the cessation of hostilities, the [[United States Air Force]] occupied nearby Kunsan Air Base, which has affected Gunsan City.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] was originally constructed, under Japanese direction, by reclaiming mudflats starting in about 1923. Kunsan Air Base has hosted a variety of USAF combat aircraft. The proximity of US service members to Gunsan City has provided some economic growth to Gunsan City, but the base's influence has waned since the 1990s as a result of a more powerful and diversified Korean economy. The downtown shopping districts that catered to US troops have transformed into areas that are indistinguishable from surrounding areas that serve Korean shoppers. Only a few remaining stores hint at the area's previous manifestation as an American shopping district. The small Okku-Silver Town (or more popularly America Town) caters to US troops. About {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} from the main gate of Kunsan Air Base, America Town hosts bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops.\n\n==Economy==\nToday, Gunsan's economy thrives on fishing, agriculture and heavy industry west of the city in the reclaimed area known as the Industrial Zone. [[GM Korea]] operates a factory here that assembles the [[Chevrolet Aveo]] worldwide and as the [[Holden Barina]] in Australia and New Zealand. Near the port, the [[Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle]] factory produces Daewoo trucks for the domestic and export markets. In the domestic market vehicles are sold under Daewoo brand; the [[Tata Group|Tata]] brand name is used for export due to the dilution of the [[Daewoo]] brand.\n\nIt is a major port, especially for rice shipments, and is a commercial center for the rice grown in the Geum basin. Rice processing and shipbuilding are important industries, and paper, lumber, rubber, and plastic are also produced. Originally a poor fishing village, Gunsan gained importance with the development of its port, which was opened to foreign trade in 1899. The Japanese, who ruled Korea from 1905 to 1945, further developed the city and port.\n\nJust south of Gunsan is the newly opened [[Saemangum Seawall]], the longest [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] in the world.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Tourist attractions===\n[[File:Wolmyeongparktw.jpg|250px|thumb|Wolmyeong Park (Susi Tower)]]\n[[File:Dongguktemple.jpg|250px|thumb|Dongguksa]]\n\nThe [[Gunsan Islands]] consist of 16 inhabited islands and 47 uninhabited islands. Gogunsangundo Islands constitutes Shinsido Island, Munyeodo Island, Bangchukdo Island, and Maldo Island, and Seonyudo Island is the center of the islands. A passenger ship to Seonyudo Island operates on average 6-8 times a day.\n\n''Eunpa,'' meaning \"Silver Wave\" (because of its feature of shining water under sunshine), was originally a reservoir for agriculture but designated as a National Tourist Place in 1985. In spring, a 1-km cherry blossom tunnel is formed from the entrance to the facility compound. In summer, people can enjoy wind surfing and boating in the acacia fragrance. In fall, people can enjoy walking along a promenade stretching from the meeting square at the entrance while picking up chestnuts. It is not only known as a local representation of Gunsan, but also as the nation's tourist place with a mixture of Mulbit (Water and Light) Bridge 370 m long and 3 m wide. A music fountain operates 8 times, 20 minutes per round. It was selected as one of the 100 Big Noted Tourists in Korea in the 'Creating a Good Place to Live' local resources contest.\n\nIn 1990, a river mouth bank was constructed at the mouth of Geum Rivers, which was the gateway of [[Baekje]]. It is spotlighted as the largest migrant bird colony in Korea with reed forests. It has become nationally famous because of the grand sight of many uncommon migratory birds such as Baikal teals, wild ducks, mallards, wild geese, herring gulls, black head gulls, black head Kentish plovers, etc., and approximately 500,000 winter migrant birds of 40 types visit between mid-October and March. A 360-degree observatory offers detailed and close-up views of migrant birds of the Geumgang River area, and the Bird Watching Gallery is the best vantage point in all of Korea to view migratory birds.\n\n[[Wolmyeong Dong Park|Wolmyeong Park]] is in the middle of Gunsan city. During spring, colorful cherry blossoms and camellia flowers are in full bloom, while the foliage attracts visitors during fall.{{fact|date=February 2019}} On the mountain top, both Geumgang (river) and West sea are visible.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nJapanese style houses in Sinheung-Dong are traditional houses of Japanese style, which was constructed by Hiroth, a Japanese fabric dealer of large scale during the colonial era. It has a great architectural value{{fact|date=February 2019}} as the roof, finishing touch of outer wall, and inner garden are kept as they were when it was first constructed. It is also a place of filming the movies, such as ''The Son of the General'' and ''Ttajja''.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nDongguksa is the only temple left in Korea which was built in Japanese style. Plain eaves and many windows of the outer wall of the main temple are the characteristics of Japanese temples.\n\nJinpo Marine Park is a theme park that displays retired military equipment (13 types, 16 equipment) of the armed forces, such as Korean naval vessels, at the inner harbor of the historical site of Jinpo battle, recorded to be the first naval battle with guns of warships in the world.\n\nSaemanguem New Year's Festival is hosted on the first day (January 1) of every year at Saemangeum seawall, the longest seawall in the world. Through events, such as sharing rice cake soup, writing new wishes, and releasing balloons of hopes, this day provides an opportunity to plan the new year with family, make wishes, and feel the mystique and deep sensation of nature.\n\n===Festival===\n*Saemanguem New Year's Festival\n*Kunsan Time Travel Festival\n\n===Museum===\n* [[Gunsan Modern History Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Gunsan

South Korea|city]] in [[North Jeolla Province]], [[South Korea]]. It is on the south bank of the [[Geum River]] just upstream from its exit into the [[Yellow Sea]]. It has emerged as a high-tech manufacturing industrial city and an international trade seaport that is approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Seoul on the midwest coast of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]] is in the city. To encourage investment, a free trade zone has been declared in the area.\n\nNotable residents of Gunsan include actress [[Lee Eun-ju]], comedian [[Park Myeong-su]], and [[Teen Top]] member L.Joe. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Kunsan air base with F-16s.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kunsan Air Base]]]]\n\nGunsan was a small fishing village on the banks of the Geum River, near where the river spills into the Yellow Sea. It sits on the fertile western ''Honam'' plain where much rice is harvested. Gunsan became a port in the late 19th century largely due to pressure from the Japanese on the Koreans to ship rice to [[Japan]]. In 1899, Gunsan Port officially opened up to international trade. Gunsan City was largely settled by Japanese during the period of the Japanese occupation. The old (now demolished) City Hall and the Customs House are of Japanese construction. After liberation from the Japanese in 1945, Gunsan began to grow slowly.\n\nThe [[Korean War]] of the 1950s left the Gunsan area relatively unscathed. The initial drive south by the Communist North Koreans pushed the [[United Nations]] and South Korean forces toward [[Busan]] so quickly that Gunsan was spared from protracted fighting.\n\nNevertheless, a battalion of [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Korean Marines]], entrenched in the hills above Gunsan Port, withheld overwhelming communist forces. Their bravery created extra time for the evacuation of the town and port. The action is commemorated with a monument on the ridgeline where the heaviest fighting occurred. ({{coord|35|59|26|N|126|42|16|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:KR-45|name=(monument)}})\n\nThe drive north by the United Nations forces occurred so rapidly that there was little direct confrontation in the area. After the cessation of hostilities, the [[United States Air Force]] occupied nearby Kunsan Air Base, which has affected Gunsan City.\n\n[[Kunsan Air Base]] was originally constructed, under Japanese direction, by reclaiming mudflats starting in about 1923. Kunsan Air Base has hosted a variety of USAF combat aircraft. The proximity of US service members to Gunsan City has provided some economic growth to Gunsan City, but the base's influence has waned since the 1990s as a result of a more powerful and diversified Korean economy. The downtown shopping districts that catered to US troops have transformed into areas that are indistinguishable from surrounding areas that serve Korean shoppers. Only a few remaining stores hint at the area's previous manifestation as an American shopping district. The small Okku-Silver Town (or more popularly America Town) caters to US troops. About {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} from the main gate of Kunsan Air Base, America Town hosts bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops.\n\n==Economy==\nToday, Gunsan's economy thrives on fishing, agriculture and heavy industry west of the city in the reclaimed area known as the Industrial Zone. [[GM Korea]] operates a factory here that assembles the [[Chevrolet Aveo]] worldwide and as the [[Holden Barina]] in Australia and New Zealand. Near the port, the [[Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle]] factory produces Daewoo trucks for the domestic and export markets. In the domestic market vehicles are sold under Daewoo brand; the [[Tata Group|Tata]] brand name is used for export due to the dilution of the [[Daewoo]] brand.\n\nIt is a major port, especially for rice shipments, and is a commercial center for the rice grown in the Geum basin. Rice processing and shipbuilding are important industries, and paper, lumber, rubber, and plastic are also produced. Originally a poor fishing village, Gunsan gained importance with the development of its port, which was opened to foreign trade in 1899. The Japanese, who ruled Korea from 1905 to 1945, further developed the city and port.\n\nJust south of Gunsan is the newly opened [[Saemangum Seawall]], the longest [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] in the world.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Tourist attractions===\n[[File:Wolmyeongparktw.jpg|250px|thumb|Wolmyeong Park (Susi Tower)]]\n[[File:Dongguktemple.jpg|250px|thumb|Dongguksa]]\n\nThe [[Gunsan Islands]] consist of 16 inhabited islands and 47 uninhabited islands. Gogunsangundo Islands constitutes Shinsido Island, Munyeodo Island, Bangchukdo Island, and Maldo Island, and Seonyudo Island is the center of the islands. A passenger ship to Seonyudo Island operates on average 6-8 times a day.\n\n''Eunpa,'' meaning \"Silver Wave\" (because of its feature of shining water under sunshine), was originally a reservoir for agriculture but designated as a National Tourist Place in 1985. In spring, a 1-km cherry blossom tunnel is formed from the entrance to the facility compound. In summer, people can enjoy wind surfing and boating in the acacia fragrance. In fall, people can enjoy walking along a promenade stretching from the meeting square at the entrance while picking up chestnuts. It is not only known as a local representation of Gunsan, but also as the nation's tourist place with a mixture of Mulbit (Water and Light) Bridge 370 m long and 3 m wide. A music fountain operates 8 times, 20 minutes per round. It was selected as one of the 100 Big Noted Tourists in Korea in the 'Creating a Good Place to Live' local resources contest.\n\nIn 1990, a river mouth bank was constructed at the mouth of Geum Rivers, which was the gateway of [[Baekje]]. It is spotlighted as the largest migrant bird colony in Korea with reed forests. It has become nationally famous because of the grand sight of many uncommon migratory birds such as Baikal teals, wild ducks, mallards, wild geese, herring gulls, black head gulls, black head Kentish plovers, etc., and approximately 500,000 winter migrant birds of 40 types visit between mid-October and March. A 360-degree observatory offers detailed and close-up views of migrant birds of the Geumgang River area, and the Bird Watching Gallery is the best vantage point in all of Korea to view migratory birds.\n\n[[Wolmyeong Dong Park|Wolmyeong Park]] is in the middle of Gunsan city. During spring, colorful cherry blossoms and camellia flowers are in full bloom, while the foliage attracts visitors during fall.{{fact|date=February 2019}} On the mountain top, both Geumgang (river) and West sea are visible.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nJapanese style houses in Sinheung-Dong are traditional houses of Japanese style, which was constructed by Hiroth, a Japanese fabric dealer of large scale during the colonial era. It has a great architectural value{{fact|date=February 2019}} as the roof, finishing touch of outer wall, and inner garden are kept as they were when it was first constructed. It is also a place of filming the movies, such as ''The Son of the General'' and ''Ttajja''.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nDongguksa is the only temple left in Korea which was built in Japanese style. Plain eaves and many windows of the outer wall of the main temple are the characteristics of Japanese temples.\n\nJinpo Marine Park is a theme park that displays retired military equipment (13 types, 16 equipment) of the armed forces, such as Korean naval vessels, at the inner harbor of the historical site of Jinpo battle, recorded to be the first naval battle with guns of warships in the world.\n\nSaemanguem New Year\u2019s Festival is hosted on the first day (January 1) of every year at Saemangeum seawall, the longest seawall in the world. Through events, such as sharing rice cake soup, writing new wishes, and releasing balloons of hopes, this day provides an opportunity to plan the new year with family, make wishes, and feel the mystique and deep sensation of nature.\n\n===Festival===\n*Saemanguem New Year's Festival\n*Kunsan Time Travel Festival\n\n===Museum===\n* [[Gunsan Modern History Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Gunsan

At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and is able to be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it, and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and is able to be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it, and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

({{lang-ku|\u0647\u06d5\u06b5\u06d5\u0628\u062c\u06d5, Helebce}}) is a city in [[Kurdistan Region]] and the capital of [[Halabja Governorate]], located in Iraq about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} northeast of [[Baghdad]] and {{convert|9|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} from the [[Iran]]ian border.\n\nThe city lies at the base of what is often referred to as the greater [[Hewraman]] region stretching across the [[Iran]]\u2013[[Iraq]] border. Halabja is surrounded by Hawraman and Shnrwe range in the northeast, Balambo range in the south and [[Sirwan River|Sirwan river]] in the west. The [[Kurds]] in the city of Halabja generally speak only the [[Sorani]] dialect of Kurdish, but some residents of the surrounding villages speak the [[Hewrami]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nHalabja has a long history, as proven by excavations at nearby archaeological sites like [[Bakr Awa]]. The cemetery includes the tombs of several historical figures, such as Ahmed Mukhtar Jaff, Tayar Bag Jaff and [[Lady Adela|Adila Khanim]]. In August 2009, three 17th century tombs were discovered in the Ababile district of the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ancient tombs found in Halabja |publisher=AK News |date=2008-08-09 |url=http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/1/61417/ |accessdate=2009-09-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821143650/http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/1/61417/ |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis suggests that the town is somewhat older than indicated by some sources, which claim that it was built by the [[Ottoman Empire]] at about 1850. However, modern developments date from the early 20th century. The post office opened in 1924 and the first school opened the following year. The Qaysari Pasha and Hamid Bag bazaars were built in 1932. Electricity did not reach the city until 1940.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Halabja |publisher=PUK media |date=2009-03-16 |url=http://pukmedia.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3760&Itemid=1 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003135858/http://pukmedia.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3760&Itemid=1 |archive-date=3 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there were many [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers stationed in Halabja.

An interdisciplinary scientific study from 2019, after more than three decades, shows that the chemical attacks on Halabja have long-term biological, psychological and social effects on the survivors. The authors, Faraidoun Moradi, Mia S\u00f6derberg, Fazil Moradi and others conclude: \"The post-exposure somatic and psychosocial effects such as respiratory symptoms of CWA are plausible contributor to poor general health and quality of life among survivors.
