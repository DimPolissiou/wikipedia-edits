Modelling of these busts was performed by Carl Valerius, sculptor and stone mason of [[Harden\u2013Murrumburrah]], perhaps best known for his bronze statues at the Australian Light Horse Memorial in Harden\u2013Murrumburrah, notably the horse \"Bill the Bastard\", of which the full size version is expected to be completed in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visithilltopsregion.com.au/carl-valerius/|title=Carl Valerius, Local Artist, Stone Mason & creator of Bill the Bastard statue |date=27 May 2019|publisher=Hilltops Council|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\nThe nearby statue by Valerius<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sothebysaustralia.com.au/lot/AU0822/126|title=A Life-size Hollow-cast Bronze Statue of Donald Bradman, By Carl Valerius |publisher=Sotheby's Australia|access-date=24 September 2019}} artist's copy, sold 7 April 2018 for $52,000 at public auction entitled Russell Crowe \u2014 Art of Divorce.</ref> (shown below) of Bradman in action was unveiled during the celebrations for \"Sir Don\"'s 92nd Birthday in August 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cricket Captains' Walk|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/sport/display/20906-cricket-captains%60-walk |publisher=Monuments Australia|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\nA minor mystery surrounds the Brian Booth sculpture, similar in style to others by Valerius, but not credited in the official documentation. There is no obvious clue in the plaques, which have been commendably uniform in style and execution over 30 years.\n*Stage 2, comprising the remaining 30 captains, was unveiled by the sculptor [[Tom Bass (sculptor)|Tom Bass]] on 27 August 2008, the centenary of Bradman's birth barely a kilometre away. Much of this work was performed by Bass and his team. His bust of Bradman was unveiled by the cricketer's grandson, Tom Bradman.<ref>From details on \"diptych\" plaque at entrance to Walk (pictured in \"Gallery\" directly above)</ref>\n*Stage 3, unveiled on 12 March 2020, brought the walk up-to-date with the unveiling of three new busts - Shane Watson, Steve Smith and Tim Paine and a plaque for Michael Clarke, who was mid-career when the second tranche of busts were commissioned.

Modelling of these busts was performed by Carl Valerius, sculptor and stone mason of [[Harden\u2013Murrumburrah]], perhaps best known for his bronze statues at the Australian Light Horse Memorial in Harden\u2013Murrumburrah, notably the horse \"Bill the Bastard\", of which the full size version is expected to be completed in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visithilltopsregion.com.au/carl-valerius/|title=Carl Valerius, Local Artist, Stone Mason & creator of Bill the Bastard statue |date=27 May 2019|publisher=Hilltops Council|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\nThe nearby statue by Valerius<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sothebysaustralia.com.au/lot/AU0822/126|title=A Life-size Hollow-cast Bronze Statue of Donald Bradman, By Carl Valerius |publisher=Sotheby's Australia|access-date=24 September 2019}} artist's copy, sold 7 April 2018 for $52,000 at public auction entitled Russell Crowe \u2014 Art of Divorce.</ref> (shown below) of Bradman in action was unveiled during the celebrations for \"Sir Don\"'s 92nd Birthday in August 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cricket Captains' Walk|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/sport/display/20906-cricket-captains%60-walk |publisher=Monuments Australia|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\nA minor mystery surrounds the Brian Booth sculpture, similar in style to others by Valerius, but not credited in the official documentation. There is no obvious clue in the plaques, which have been commendably uniform in style and execution over 30 years.\n*Stage 2, comprising the remaining 30 captains, was unveiled by the sculptor [[Tom Bass (sculptor)|Tom Bass]] on 27 August 2008, the centenary of Bradman's birth barely a kilometre away. Much of this work was performed by Bass and his team. His bust of Bradman was unveiled by the cricketer's grandson, Tom Bradman.<ref>From details on \"diptych\" plaque at entrance to Walk (pictured in \"Gallery\" directly above)</ref>\n*Stage 3, unveiled on 12 March 2020, brought the walk up-to-date with the unveiling of three new busts - Shane Watson, Steve Smith and Tim Paine and a plaque for Michael Clarke, who was mid-career when the second tranche of busts were commissioned. All three were made by the Tom Bass sculpture studio.\n\n==The busts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
