Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of cell-death is unknown. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article [[Parkinson's disease]]:\n\n''The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost may consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The [[alpha-synuclein]]-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteasome.  This [[protein]] accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called [[Lewy bodies]]. The latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two major cellular organelles \u2013 the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain proteins like Rab1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.<ref>\"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Discovered,\" [http://www.hhmi.org/news/lindquist20060622.html HHMI Research News] June 22, 2006.</ref>''\n\nRecent research suggests that impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein leads to its accumulation in the Lewy bodies.

While polyglutamine-repeat diseases encompass many different neurodegenerative disorders, there are many more it does not apply to. The genetics behind each disease are different and often unknown.\n\n===Protein misfolding===\nSeveral neurodegenerative diseases are classified as [[proteopathy|proteopathies]] as they are associated with the [[protein aggregation|aggregation]] of [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]].\n*'''[[alpha-synuclein]]:''' can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by [[Lewy bodies]], such as Parkinson's disease, [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n*'''tau:''' hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]] is the main component of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] in Alzheimer's disease.\n*'''[[beta amyloid]]:''' the major component of [[senile plaques]] in Alzheimer's disease.\n*'''[[prion]]:''' main component of prion diseases and [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]].\n\n===Intracellular mechanisms===\n\n====Protein degradation pathways====\n[[Parkinson's]] disease and [[Huntington's]] disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n\n* cytosol, e.g. [[Parkinson's]] & [[Huntington's]]\n* nucleus, e.g. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1]] (SCA1)\n* endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies)\n* extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-\u03b2 in Alzheimer's disease\n\nThere are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles:\n\n*'''ubiquitin\u2013proteasome:''' protein [[ubiquitin]] along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins, which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins.<ref name =\"rubinsztein\"/>\n** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration.<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n*'''autophagy\u2013lysosome pathways:''' a form of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: '''[[macroautophagy]]''' and '''chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)'''.<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n**'''macroautophagy''' is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration.<ref name =\"rubinsztein\"/>\n**'''chaperone-mediated autophagy''' defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA-pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates.<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n\n====Membrane damage====\nDamage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases.

This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of [[cytochrome c]] from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Over production of ROS ([[oxidative stress]]) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, [[mitochondrial fission]] and [[mitochondrial fusion|fusion]], lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition.

This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.<ref name = bredesen />\n\n====Autophagic (type II)====\nAutophagy is essentially a form of intracellular [[phagocytosis]] in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

In addition, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause [[necrosis]], or aponecrosis \u2013 the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis.<ref name = bredesen />\n\n===PCD===\nIn the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, PCD may be pathogenic. In order to identify the potential of neuroprotective targets in PCD machinery, there were experimental models conducted on these neurodegenerative diseases. These studies showed that the expression of certain components have been altered by genetic and pharmacological means. Expression of PCD molecular components are said to be controlled by gene and antisense therapy, but this needs further research.

For a complete list, see the table under '''Polyglutamine (PolyQ) Diseases''' in the article [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]. While polyglutamine-repeat diseases encompass many different neurodegenerative disorders, there are many more it does not apply to. The genetics behind each disease are different and often unknown.\n\n===Protein misfolding===\nSeveral neurodegenerative diseases are classified as [[proteopathy|proteopathies]] as they are associated with the [[protein aggregation|aggregation]] of [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]].\n*'''[[alpha-synuclein]]:''' can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by [[Lewy bodies]], such as Parkinson's disease, [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n*'''tau:''' hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]] is the main component of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] in Alzheimer's disease.\n*'''[[beta amyloid]]:''' the major component of [[senile plaques]] in Alzheimer's disease.\n*'''[[prion]]:''' main component of prion diseases and [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]].\n\n===Intracellular mechanisms===\n\n====Protein degradation pathways====\n[[Parkinson's]] disease and [[Huntington's]] disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n\n* cytosol, e.g. [[Parkinson's]] & [[Huntington's]]\n* nucleus, e.g. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1]] (SCA1)\n* endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies)\n* extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-\u03b2 in Alzheimer's disease\n\nThere are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles:\n\n*'''ubiquitin\u2013proteasome:''' protein [[ubiquitin]] along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins, which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins.<ref name =\"rubinsztein\"/>\n** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration.<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n*'''autophagy\u2013lysosome pathways:''' a form of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: '''[[macroautophagy]]''' and '''chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)'''.<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n**'''macroautophagy''' is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration.<ref name =\"rubinsztein\"/>\n**'''chaperone-mediated autophagy''' defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA-pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates.<ref name=\"rubinsztein\"/>\n\n====Membrane damage====\nDamage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature,<ref name=curvature>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Varkey J, Isas JM, Mizuno N, etal |title=Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=285 |issue=42 |pages=32486\u201393 |date=October 2010  |pmid=20693280 |pmc=2952250 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.139576}}</ref> and cause extensive tubulation and vesiculation when incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles.<ref name=curvature/>\n[http://www.jbc.org/content/287/35/29301.long The tubes formed from these lipid vesicles consist of both micellar as well as bilayer tubes.

This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of [[cytochrome c]] from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Over production of ROS ([[oxidative stress]]) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, [[mitochondrial fission]] and [[mitochondrial fusion|fusion]], lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition.

Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that this is a hypothesis and more research must be done.<ref name = bredesen />\n\n====Cytoplasmic (type III)====\nThe final and least understood PCD mechanism is through non-apoptotic processes. These fall under Type III, or cytoplasmic cell death. Many other forms of PCD are observed but not fully understood or accepted by the scientific community.

In addition, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause [[necrosis]], or aponecrosis \u2013 the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations.
