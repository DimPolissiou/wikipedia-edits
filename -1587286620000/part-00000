The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as [[Irregular military|irregular forces]]. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George\u2019s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony\u2019s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion\u2014the Kumaon\u2014was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men.

They discouraged the Brahminical influence in the military as they considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of [[Thakuri]] and [[Khas]] groups in the Gorkha units{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} and refused to recruit tribes other than [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]] in the Gorkha units.{{sfn|Singh|1997|pp=220\u2013221}} They also pressurized Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] to include at least of 75% of the forces of [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]].{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}}\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}\n\n[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]]. During the Battle of Loos (June\u2013December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\".<ref>Sengupta 2007.</ref> \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in [[Waziristan]], where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile [[Pashtun people|Pathan tribesmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} \n\nDuring this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.<ref>For more detail see {{harvnb|Barthorp|2002|p=}}.{{page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghurkas in action with a 6-pdr anti-tank gun in Tunisia, 16 March 1943.

After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.\n* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.\n* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.\n* Gurkha officers commissioned from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* After 1948, the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO).

By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]; a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322\u2013323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese people]] and would be banned.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=344}} However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.\n\n===British Army Gurkhas===\n{{Main article|Brigade of Gurkhas}}\n[[File:Gurkhas on Patrol in Helmand MOD 45151723.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles on patrol in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2010.]]\nFour Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]\n* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n\nThey formed the '''Brigade of Gurkhas''' and were initially stationed in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]].

In times of crisis it can be deployed as a reaction force.

On 8 March 2007 the [[British Government]] announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement.

The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as [[Irregular military|irregular forces]]. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George\u2019s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony\u2019s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion\u2014the Kumaon\u2014was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men.

They discouraged the Brahminical influence in the military as they considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of [[Thakuri]] and [[Khas]] groups in the Gorkha units{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} and refused to recruit tribes other than [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]] in the Gorkha units.{{sfn|Singh|1997|pp=220\u2013221}} They also pressurized Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] to include at least of 75% of the forces of [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]].{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}}\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}\n\n[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]]. During the Battle of Loos (June\u2013December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\".<ref>Sengupta 2007.</ref> \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in [[Waziristan]], where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile [[Pashtun people|Pathan tribesmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} \n\nDuring this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.<ref>For more detail see {{harvnb|Barthorp|2002|p=}}.{{page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghurkas in action with a 6-pdr anti-tank gun in Tunisia, 16 March 1943.

After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.\n* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.\n* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers.

The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=226}} The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]; a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322\u2013323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese people]] and would be banned.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=344}} However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.\n\n===British Army Gurkhas===\n{{Main article|Brigade of Gurkhas}}\n[[File:Gurkhas on Patrol in Helmand MOD 45151723.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles on patrol in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2010.]]\nFour Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]\n* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n\nThey formed the '''Brigade of Gurkhas''' and were initially stationed in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]].

On 8 March 2007 the [[British Government]] announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement.

A car accident occurs, where Tiger gets into a coma, Shenbagam presumably dies, and Anu is lost. This accident was planned by Tiger's brother Sethu and Sethu's friend Maruthanaayagam. Anu is adopted with the name Roja by Shanthamoorty, who raises her in his orphanage. Many years later, Roja is grown up, but then a crimininal named Bhaiya Ganesh enters the orphanage secretly in order to molest the girls. Eventually a girl in the ashramam named Priya and Maruthanaayagam's daughter Saakshi kill Bhaiya Ganesh, and put the blame on Shanthamoorthy, who is then arrested. Roja is also unaware of her heritage as the daughter of Tiger Manickam and Shenbagam. Priya meanwhile, found Roja's childhoom items which Roja had when she was with Tiger and Shenbagam, and Priya goes to Tiger Manickam and lies to him that she is his daughter. Priya is then named Anu. Anu is also well-affiliated with Shenbagam's family. Roja, in order to bring Shanthamoorthy back, gets married to renowned Lawyer Arjun Prathap on a contractual basis for one year who agrees to help Roja. Arjun is actually the nephew of Shenbagam and belongs to Shenbagam's family. Arjun receives Roja's consent to dissolve the marriage after exactly one year by getting signatures in a mutual consent agreement. Roja accepts this agreement so that Arjun could become involved in a case related to her foster father. Arjun dislikes love and marriage due to his traumatic past involving his friend Venu's demise, but indulges in the contractual marriage in an attempt to prevent the marriage between him and Anu.\n\nThe entire family except Arjun's mother Kalpana hates Roja because she took Anu's spot. Annapoorani, who is Arjun and Anu's grandmother and Shenbagam's mother hates Roja the most. Anu teams up with Annapoorani's evil daughter and son-in-law Yashoda and Balu and try to get Roja out of the house several times. Yashoda hates Roja because Roja once humiliated her. Roja tries several times to find out her heritage, and Shantamoorthy's case, but she is stopped by Anu. Eventually Roja and Arjun fall in love with each other and the contractual marriage is forgotten. A police office called Chandrakantha who has a mysterious past also decides to help Arjun with the Bhaiya Ganesh murder case. When she is close to figuring the mystery, she is stopped by the Comissioner Gowtham Nath, who is affiliated with Saakshi for some reason. \n\nAnnapoorani's sister Kamakshi visits Canada once, and she along with Arjun, Roja, and Kalpana try to find out Roja's past and if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. Annapoorani is very sad that everyone is against Anu, and visits 108 temples and leaves the family. Kamakshi leaves India. Anu and Yashoda plan to kill Roja, but Roja only loses her eyesight. Arjun and Kalpana visit Arulvakku Amuthanayagi and seek help to restore Roja's eyesight. Arjun, on the advice of Amuthanayagi, does severe penance and brings Roja's eyesight back. After Roja's eyesight comes back, Annapoorani and Kamakshi return. Annapoorani has developed much more hatred for Arjun and Roja when she returns. Annapoorani decides to make Anu marry Arjun's brother Ashwin, but Ashwin likes a girl named Pooja. Ashwin and Pooja try to marry each other (with the help of Arjun, Roja, and Kamakshi) but are stopped by Annapoorani. Annapoorani makes arrangements for Ashwin- Anu marriage and Ashwin agrees reluctantly after Pooja gets kidnapped. However, Arjun saves Pooja in the last minute and stops the marriage. The story unfolds to show how Roja realises her dream of opening the orphanage with the help of Arjun amongst love, betrayal, hate and her past, how Arjun and Roja help Ashwin unite with Pooja, and how they try to find out if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. More twists arrive when it is revealed that Shenbagam is actually alive, but she has forgotten her past and lives as a nurse named Saraswati.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Priyanka Nalkari]] as Roja: Arjun's wife; She is the real Anu.\n* Sibbu Suryan as Arjun Prathap: He is a famous criminal lawyer; Roja's husband.\n*Shamili Sukumar as Priya (Main Antagonist): She fakes in the identity of Anu.\n\n===Supporting===\n*[[Dr. Sharmila]] as Shenbagam Manickam / Saraswathi: Roja's biological mother; Arjun's paternal aunt\n* Gayathri Shastry as Kalpana Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's mother\n* Sowmya Sharada \u2192 Sunitha as Saakshi Marudhanayagam (Antagonist): Priya's Crime Partner.\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Annapoorani Vijayakumar: Pratap, Shenbagam and Yashodha's mother\n* Venkat Renganathan as Ashwin Prathap: Arjun's younger brother\n* Smriti Kashyap as Pooja: Ashwin's wife\n* Sumathi Shree as Sumathi\n* Shiva as Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's father\n* [[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-tv-serials/68563/Chinna-thirai-Television-News/Actor-Rajesh-again-in-Television.htm |title=\u0bae\u0bc0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |publisher=cinema.dinamalar.com |access-date=2018-04-26 |language=ta}} </ref> as Tiger Manickam: Roja's biological father; He is a famous criminal lawyer\n* [[K.

Anu teams up with Annapoorani's evil daughter and son-in-law Yashoda and Balu and try to get Roja out of the house several times. Yashoda hates Roja because Roja once humiliated her. Roja tries several times to find out her heritage, and Shantamoorthy's case, but she is stopped by Anu. Eventually Roja and Arjun fall in love with each other and the contractual marriage is forgotten. A police office called Chandrakantha who has a mysterious past also decides to help Arjun with the Bhaiya Ganesh murder case. When she is close to figuring the mystery, she is stopped by the Comissioner Gowtham Nath, who is affiliated with Saakshi for some reason. \n\nAnnapoorani's sister Kamakshi visits Canada once, and she along with Arjun, Roja, and Kalpana try to find out Roja's past and if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. Annapoorani is very sad that everyone is against Anu, and visits 108 temples and leaves the family. Kamakshi leaves India. Anu and Yashoda plan to kill Roja, but Roja only loses her eyesight. Arjun and Kalpana visit Arulvakku Amuthanayagi and seek help to restore Roja's eyesight. Arjun, on the advice of Amuthanayagi, does severe penance and brings Roja's eyesight back. After Roja's eyesight comes back, Annapoorani and Kamakshi return. Annapoorani has developed much more hatred for Arjun and Roja when she returns. Annapoorani decides to make Anu marry Arjun's brother Ashwin, but Ashwin likes a girl named Pooja. Ashwin and Pooja try to marry each other (with the help of Arjun, Roja, and Kamakshi) but are stopped by Annapoorani. Annapoorani makes arrangements for Ashwin- Anu marriage and Ashwin agrees reluctantly after Pooja gets kidnapped. However, Arjun saves Pooja in the last minute and stops the marriage. The story unfolds to show how Roja realises her dream of opening the orphanage with the help of Arjun amongst love, betrayal, hate and her past, how Arjun and Roja help Ashwin unite with Pooja, and how they try to find out if Anu is actually Shenbagam's daughter or not. More twists arrive when it is revealed that Shenbagam is actually alive, but she has forgotten her past and lives as a nurse named Saraswati.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Priyanka Nalkari]] as Roja: Arjun's wife; She is the real Anu.\n* Sibbu Suryan as Arjun Prathap: He is a famous criminal lawyer; Roja's husband.\n*Shamili Sukumar as Priya (Main Antagonist): She fakes in the identity of Anu.\n\n===Supporting===\n*[[Dr. Sharmila]] as Shenbagam Manickam / Saraswathi: Roja's biological mother; Arjun's paternal aunt\n* Gayathri Shastry as Kalpana Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's mother\n* Sowmya Sharada \u2192 Sunitha as Saakshi Marudhanayagam (Antagonist): Priya's best friend.\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Annapoorani Vijayakumar: Pratap, Shenbagam and Yashodha's mother\n* Venkat Renganathan as Ashwin Prathap: Arjun's younger brother\n* Smriti Kashyap as Pooja: Ashwin's wife\n* Sumathi Shree as Sumathi\n* Shiva as Prathap: Arjun, Ashwin and Deepa's father\n* [[Rajesh (actor)|Rajesh]]<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil-tv-serials/68563/Chinna-thirai-Television-News/Actor-Rajesh-again-in-Television.htm |title=\u0bae\u0bc0\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd |publisher=cinema.dinamalar.com |access-date=2018-04-26 |language=ta}} </ref> as Tiger Manickam: Roja's biological father; He is a famous criminal lawyer\n* [[K.

Wold]] (1969). \"Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building,\" ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.</ref> Economics often analyzes systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.\n\nOne of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].<ref>For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].</ref> Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments.

Time-series data sets contain observations over time; for example, inflation over the course of several years. Cross-sectional data sets contain observations at a single point in time; for example, many individuals' incomes in a given year.  Panel data sets contain both time-series and cross-sectional observations. Multi-dimensional panel data sets contain observations across time, cross-sectionally, and across some third dimension. For example, the [[Survey of Professional Forecasters]] contains forecasts for many forecasters (cross-sectional observations), at many points in time (time series observations), and at multiple forecast horizons (a third dimension).<ref>Davies, A., 2006.

One widely used remedy is the method of [[instrumental variable]]s (IV). For an economic model described by more than one equation, [[Simultaneous equations model|simultaneous-equation methods]] may be used to remedy similar problems, including two IV variants, Two-Stage Least Squares ([[2SLS]]), and Three-Stage Least Squares ([[3SLS]]).<ref>[[Peter Kennedy (economist)]] (2003).

The benefit of this approach is that any policy recommendations are not subject to the [[Lucas critique]] since counter-factual analyses take an agent's re-optimization into account. Structural econometric this is very much right analyses begin with an economic model that captures the salient features of the agents under investigation. The researcher then searches for parameters of the model that match the outputs of the model to the data.\n\nOne example is [[dynamic discrete choice]], where there are two common ways of doing this. The first requires the researcher to completely solve the model and then use [[maximum likelihood]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rust |first=John |title=Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=1987 |pages=999\u20131033 |jstor=1911259 |doi=10.2307/1911259 }}</ref> The second bypasses the full solution of the model and estimates models in two stages, allowing the researcher to consider more complicated models with strategic interactions and multiple equilibria.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hotz |first=V. Joseph |last2=Miller |first2=Robert A. |title=Conditional Choice Probabilities and the Estimation of Dynamic Models |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=497\u2013529 |jstor=2298122 |doi=10.2307/2298122 }}</ref>\n\nAnother example of structural econometrics is in the estimation of [[first-price sealed-bid auction]]s with independent private values.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guerre|first=E.|last2=Perrigne|first2=I.|last3=Vuong|first3=Q.|title=Optimal Nonparametric Estimation of First Price Auctions|journal=[[Econometrica]]|volume=68|issue=3|year=2000|pages=525\u2013574|doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00123 }}</ref> The key difficulty with bidding data from these auctions is that bids only partially reveal information on the underlying valuations, bids shade the underlying valuations. One would like to estimate these valuations in order to understand the magnitude of profits each bidder makes. More importantly, it is necessary to have the valuation distribution in hand to engage in [[mechanism design]]. In a first price sealed bid auction the expected payoff of a bidder is given by:Majid Khan Dakorak Swat SST\n\n:<math> (v-b)\\Pr(b\\ \\textrm{wins}) </math>\nwhere v is the bidder valuation, b is the bid. The optimal bid <math>b^*</math> solves a first order condition:\n:<math> (v-b^*)\\frac{\\partial \\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})}{\\partial b}-\\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})=0 </math>\nwhich can be re-arranged to yield the following equation for <math>v</math>\n:<math> v=b^*+\\frac{\\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})}{\\partial \\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})/\\partial b} </math>\n\nNotice that the probability that a bid wins an auction can be estimated from a data set of completed auctions, where all bids are observed. This can be done using simple [[nonparametric estimator]]s, such as [[kernel regression]]. If all bids are observed, it is then possible to use the above relation and the estimated probability function and its derivative to point wise estimate the underlying valuation. This will then allow the investigator to estimate the valuation distribution.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*Darnell, Adrian C. and J. Lynne Evans.

Wold]] (1969). \"Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building,\" ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.</ref> Economics often analyzes systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.\n\nOne of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].<ref>For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].</ref> Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments. Observational data may be subject to [[omitted-variable bias]] and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal analysis of simultaneous-equation models.<ref>Edward E.

Time-series data sets contain observations over time; for example, inflation over the course of several years. Cross-sectional data sets contain observations at a single point in time; for example, many individuals' incomes in a given year.  Panel data sets contain both time-series and cross-sectional observations. Multi-dimensional panel data sets contain observations across time, cross-sectionally, and across some third dimension. For example, the [[Survey of Professional Forecasters]] contains forecasts for many forecasters (cross-sectional observations), at many points in time (time series observations), and at multiple forecast horizons (a third dimension).<ref>Davies, A., 2006.

One widely used remedy is the method of [[instrumental variable]]s (IV). For an economic model described by more than one equation, [[Simultaneous equations model|simultaneous-equation methods]] may be used to remedy similar problems, including two IV variants, Two-Stage Least Squares ([[2SLS]]), and Three-Stage Least Squares ([[3SLS]]).<ref>[[Peter Kennedy (economist)]] (2003).

The benefit of this approach is that any policy recommendations are not subject to the [[Lucas critique]] since counter-factual analyses take an agent's re-optimization into account. Structural econometric analyses begin with an economic model that captures the salient features of the agents under investigation. The researcher then searches for parameters of the model that match the outputs of the model to the data.\n\nOne example is [[dynamic discrete choice]], where there are two common ways of doing this. The first requires the researcher to completely solve the model and then use [[maximum likelihood]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rust |first=John |title=Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=1987 |pages=999\u20131033 |jstor=1911259 |doi=10.2307/1911259 }}</ref> The second bypasses the full solution of the model and estimates models in two stages, allowing the researcher to consider more complicated models with strategic interactions and multiple equilibria.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hotz |first=V. Joseph |last2=Miller |first2=Robert A. |title=Conditional Choice Probabilities and the Estimation of Dynamic Models |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=497\u2013529 |jstor=2298122 |doi=10.2307/2298122 }}</ref>\n\nAnother example of structural econometrics is in the estimation of [[first-price sealed-bid auction]]s with independent private values.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guerre|first=E.|last2=Perrigne|first2=I.|last3=Vuong|first3=Q.|title=Optimal Nonparametric Estimation of First Price Auctions|journal=[[Econometrica]]|volume=68|issue=3|year=2000|pages=525\u2013574|doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00123 }}</ref> The key difficulty with bidding data from these auctions is that bids only partially reveal information on the underlying valuations, bids shade the underlying valuations. One would like to estimate these valuations in order to understand the magnitude of profits each bidder makes. More importantly, it is necessary to have the valuation distribution in hand to engage in [[mechanism design]]. In a first price sealed bid auction the expected payoff of a bidder is given by:\n\n:<math> (v-b)\\Pr(b\\ \\textrm{wins}) </math>\nwhere v is the bidder valuation, b is the bid. The optimal bid <math>b^*</math> solves a first order condition:\n:<math> (v-b^*)\\frac{\\partial \\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})}{\\partial b}-\\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})=0 </math>\nwhich can be re-arranged to yield the following equation for <math>v</math>\n:<math> v=b^*+\\frac{\\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})}{\\partial \\Pr(b^*\\ \\textrm{wins})/\\partial b} </math>\n\nNotice that the probability that a bid wins an auction can be estimated from a data set of completed auctions, where all bids are observed. This can be done using simple [[nonparametric estimator]]s, such as [[kernel regression]]. If all bids are observed, it is then possible to use the above relation and the estimated probability function and its derivative to point wise estimate the underlying valuation. This will then allow the investigator to estimate the valuation distribution.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*Darnell, Adrian C. and J. Lynne Evans.

His work mainly comprises [[Abstract expressionism|abstract]] and [[Informalism|informal]] paintings and drawings.\n\n== History ==\n\nSilvio Formichetti was born in 1969 in Pratola Peligna, in the province of [[L'Aquila]]. Formichetti's first works centred around two themes: the landscapes of [[Abruzzo]] and female nudes.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, he became intrigued by the informal painting of [[Jackson Pollock]] and his dripping technique, known as [[Action Painting]]. The works of [[Hans Hartung]] and Formichetti's compatriots [[Afro Basaldella]] and [[Emilio Vedova]] were also a source of inspiration for his own abstract style of painting.<ref>{{cite web|title=E' Silvio Formichetti l'artista che realizzer\u00e0 il Palio della Quintana|url=https://www.ilgerme.it/e-silvio-formichetti-lartista-che-realizzera-il-palio-della-quintana/|author=Pubblicato da: anna|work=ilGerme|date=2018-05-04|accessdate=2020-03-21|language=it-IT}}</ref>\n\nMost of his paintings are characterized by powerful primary colours such as red, yellow and green, combined with black and white. Formichetti's visual style has evolved over the years, but remains colourful, emotionally charged and experimental. Since 1999 he has also incorporated more [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] into his works. He expresses himself through two fundamental instruments: [[paint brush]]es and [[spatula]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mostra \"Evoluzione del silenzio\" di Silvio Formichetti Alla Rocca|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbxm5P5sQ0|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=22 March 2020|language=IT}}</ref>\n\nOn the request of [[Vittorio Sgarbi]], Silvio Formichetti was in 2011 one of the exhibitors at the Italian Pavilion of the [[54th Venice Biennale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pratola Peligna, Silvio Formichetti alla 54\u00aa Biennale di Venezia|url=https://www.cityrumors.it/notizie-laquila/cultura-spettacolo-laquila/32561-silvio-formichetti-biennale-venezia.html|work=Cityrumors|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2020-03-21|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mostra \"Evoluzione del silenzio\" di Silvio Formichetti Alla Rocca|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbxm5P5sQ0|author=Comune di Umbertide|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=22 March 2020|language=it}}</ref> Since then he is considered as one of the major Italian representatives of informal painting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silvio Formichetti|url=https://www.3bgallery.com/silvio-formichetti|work=3bgallery|accessdate=2020-03-21|language=it}}</ref>\n\nFor years Formichetti has also realized works of [[live painting]] and [[bodypainting]].

He expresses himself through two fundamental instruments: [[paint brush]]es and [[spatula]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mostra \"Evoluzione del silenzio\" di Silvio Formichetti Alla Rocca|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbxm5P5sQ0|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=22 March 2020|language=IT}}</ref>\n\nOn the request of [[Vittorio Sgarbi]], Silvio Formichetti was in 2011 one of the exhibitors at the Italian Pavilion of the [[54th Venice Biennale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pratola Peligna, Silvio Formichetti alla 54\u00aa Biennale di Venezia|url=https://www.cityrumors.it/notizie-laquila/cultura-spettacolo-laquila/32561-silvio-formichetti-biennale-venezia.html|work=Cityrumors|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2020-03-21|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mostra \"Evoluzione del silenzio\" di Silvio Formichetti Alla Rocca|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbxm5P5sQ0|author=Comune di Umbertide|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=22 March 2020|language=it}}</ref> Since then he is considered as one of the major Italian representatives of informal painting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silvio Formichetti|url=https://www.3bgallery.com/silvio-formichetti|work=3bgallery|accessdate=2020-03-21|language=it}}</ref>\n\nFor years Formichetti has also realized works of [[live painting]] and [[bodypainting]].

The [[Vedic period]] is characterized by [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] culture that invaded from [[Central Asia]] and settled in [[Punjab region]]. The [[Kambojas]], [[Daradas]], [[Kekaya|Kaikayas]], Madras, [[Pauravas]], [[Yaudheya]]s, [[Malavas]], [[Saindhavas]] and [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]s invaded, settled and ruled ancient [[Punjab region]]. After overrunning the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] in 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] marched into present-day [[Punjab region]] with an army of 50,000. The Khushab was ruled by [[Maurya Empire]], [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] and [[Shahi]] kingdoms.\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].\n\nAfter the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh Empire]] invaded and occupied Khushab Tehsil. During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], Noorpur Thal Tehsil increased in population and importance. During [[British Raj|British rule]] the road and railway networks were built to connect Noorpur Tehsil with the rest of [[Punjab region]].\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]].  After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Noorpur Thal Tehsil. Noorpur Thal was named tehsil in 1982 when Khushab was given the status of district.\n\n==Union Councils==\nNoorpur Thal is subdivided into 11 Union Councils.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*  [[Adhi Kot]]\n*  [[Jamali Noorpur]]\n*  [[Jaura Kalan]]\n*  [[Bourana]]\n*  [[Jharkal]]\n*  [[Khai Khurd]]\n{{col-2}}\n*  [[Khatwan Balouch]]\n*  '''Noorpur Thal'''\n*  [[Pelowaince]]\n*  [[Dhamak]]\n*  [[Rangpur, Punjab|Rangpur]]\n{{col-end}}\n* Biland\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jamali Balochan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Punjab, Pakistan}}\n{{Khushab-Union-Councils}}\n{{Tehsils of Punjab (Pakistan)}}\n\n khatwan\n\n[[Category:Tehsils of Punjab, Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Khushab District]]\n\n\n{{Khushab-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = Noorpur Thal Tehsil\n|native_name            = {{Nastaliq|\u062a\u062d\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u0646\u064f\u0648\u0631\u067e\u064f\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0647\u0644}}\n|other_name             =\n|settlement_type        = Tehsil\n|image_skyline          =\n|imagesize              =\n|image_caption          =  \n|pushpin_map            = \n|pushpin_label_position =\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Pakistan\n|coordinates            = \n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = [[Pakistan]]\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|Region]]\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Districts of Pakistan|District]]\n|subdivision_type3      = Capital\n|subdivision_type4      = Towns\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]\n|subdivision_name2      =[[Khushab District]]\n|subdivision_name3      =[[Khushab]]\n|subdivision_name4      =\n|subdivision_name5      =\n|established_title      =\n|established_date       = \n|government_footnotes   =\n|government_type        =\n|leader_title           =Chairman\n|leader_title1           =Chairman\n|leader_name1            =Rao Muhammad Alam\n|area_metro_km2           =\n|elevation_footnotes    =  \n|elevation_m            =\n|elevation_ft           =\n|population_total               =\n|population_as_of               =\n|population_footnotes           =\n|population_density_km2         =\n|population_urban               =\n|population_density_urban_km2   =\n|population_note                =\n|postal_code_type       = \n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              =\n|website                = \n|footnotes              =\n|subdivisn_type5      = Union councils\n|leader_name            RAO Muhammad Alam\n|area_total_km2           \n|timezone               =[[Pakistan Standard Time|PST]]\n|utc_offset             = +5\n|blank_name             =\n|blank_info             =\n}}\n\n'''Noorpur Thal Tehsil'''  ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]],{{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''\u062a\u062d\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u0646\u064f\u0648\u0631\u067e\u064f\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0647\u0644'''}}}}), is a [[Tehsil]] an administrative subdivision of [[Khushab District]] in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|province]] of [[Pakistan]].

In 1005 he conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of [[Punjab region]].\n\nAfter the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Sikh Empire]] invaded and occupied Khushab Tehsil. During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], Noorpur Thal Tehsil increased in population and importance. During [[British Raj|British rule]] the road and railway networks were built to connect Noorpur Tehsil with the rest of [[Punjab region]].\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]].  After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Noorpur Thal Tehsil. Noorpur Thal was named tehsil in 1982 when Khushab was given the status of district.\n\n==Union Councils==\nNoorpur Thal is subdivided into 11 Union Councils.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*  [[Adhi Kot]]\n*  [[Jamali Noorpur]]\n*  [[Jaura Kalan]]\n*  [[Bourana]]\n*  [[Jharkal]]\n*  [[Khai Khurd]]\n{{col-2}}\n*  [[Khatwan Balouch]]\n*  '''Noorpur Thal'''\n*  [[Pelowaince]]\n*  [[Dhamak]]\n*  [[Rangpur, Punjab|Rangpur]]\n{{col-end}}\n* Biland\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jamali Balochan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Punjab, Pakistan}}\n{{Khushab-Union-Councils}}\n{{Tehsils of Punjab (Pakistan)}}\n\n khatwan\n\n[[Category:Tehsils of Punjab, Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Khushab District]]\n\n\n{{Khushab-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "1.127.107.8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(History)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noorpur_Thal_Tehsil"}

He had a few hundred concubines in [[Kyiv]] and in the country residence of [[Berestovo]]. He also had official pagan wives, the most famous being [[Rogneda of Polotsk]]. His other wives are mentioned in the [[Primary Chronicle]], with various children assigned to various wives in the different versions of the document. Hence, speculations abound.\n\n==Norse wife==\n[[Norse saga]]s mention that, while ruling in [[Novgorod]] in his early days, Volodymyr had a [[Varangian]] wife named Olava or Allogia. This unusual name is probably a feminine form of [[Olaf (disambiguation)|Olaf]]. According to [[Snorri Sturluson]] the runaway [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was sheltered by Allogia in her house; she also paid a large fine for him.\n\nSeveral authorities, notably Rydzevskaya (\"Ancient Rus and Scandinavia in 9-14 cent.\", 1978), hold that later [[skald]]s confused Volodymyr's wife Olava with his grandmother and tutor [[Olga of Kiev|Olga]], with Allogia being the distorted form of Olga's name. Others postulate Olava was a real person and the mother of '''Vysheslav''', the first of Volodymyr's sons to reign in Novgorod, as behooves the eldest son and heir. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the tradition of sending the eldest son of Kievan monarch to Novgorod existed at such an early date.\n\nThose scholars who believe that this early Norse wife was not fictitious, suppose that Volodymyr could have married her during his famous exile in [[Scandinavia]] in the late 970s. They usually refer an account in [[Ingvars saga]] (in a part called ''[[Eymund's saga]]'') which tells that [[Eric VI of Sweden]] married his daughter to a '[[Germanic king|konung]] of [[fjord]] lying to the East from [[Holmgard]]'.

Following an old Yngling tradition, '''Izyaslav''' inherited the lands of his maternal grandfather, i.e., [[Polotsk]]. According to the [[Kiev]]an succession law, his progeny forfeited their rights to the [[Kiev]]an throne, because their forefather had never ruled in [[Kiev]] supreme. They, however, retained the principality of Polotsk and formed a dynasty of local rulers, of which [[Vseslav the Sorcerer]] was the most notable.\n\n==Greek wife==\nDuring his unruly youth, Volodymyr begot his eldest son, [[Svyatopolk I|Sviatopolk]], relations with whom would cloud his declining years. His mother was a Greek nun captured by [[Svyatoslav I]] in [[Bulgaria]] and married to his lawful heir [[Yaropolk I]]. Russian historian [[Vasily Tatishchev|Vasily Tatischev]], invariably erring in the matters of onomastics, gives her the fanciful Roman name of Julia. When Yaropolk was murdered by Volodymyr's agents, the new sovereign raped his wife and she soon gave birth to a child. Thus, '''Sviatopolk''' was probably the eldest of Volodymyr's sons, although the issue of his parentage has been questioned and he has been known in the family as \"the son of two fathers\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.\n\n==Bohemian wife==\n{{main article|Malfrida}}\nVolodymyr apparently had a [[Czech people|Czech]] wife, whose name is given by [[Vasily Tatishchev]] as [[Malfrida]]. Historians have gone to extremes in order to provide a political rationale behind such an alliance, as the Czech princes are assumed to have backed up Volodymyr's brother [[Yaropolk of Kiev|Yaropolk]] rather than Volodymyr. His children by these marriage were probably '''Svyatoslav''' of Smolensk, killed during the 1015 internecine war, and [[Mstislav of Chernigov]]. Some chronicles, however, report that Rogneda was '''Mstislav''''s mother.\n\n==Bulgarian wife==\nAnother wife was a Bulgarian lady, whose name is given by Tatishchev as Adela. Historians have disagreed as to whether she came from [[Volga Bulgaria]] or from [[Bulgaria]] on the [[Danube]]. According to the [[Primary Chronicle]], both [[Boris and Gleb]] were her children. This tradition, however, is viewed by most scholars as a product of later hagiographical tendency to merge the identity of both saints. Actually, they were of different age and their names point to different cultural traditions. Judging by his Bulgarian name, Boris could have been Adela's only offspring.\n\n==Anna Porphyrogenita==\n{{main article|Anna Porphyrogenita}}\n[[File:BasileIIConstantinVIIIHoldingCross.jpg|thumb|''[[Histamenon]]'' of Anna's brothers Basil II and Constantine VIII]]\nAnna (March 13, 963 - 1011/12) was the daughter of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Romanos&nbsp;II]] ({{reign | 959 | 963)}}) and the Empress [[Theophano (Byzantine Empress)| Theophano]]. She was also the sister of Emperors [[Basil&nbsp;II]] Bulgaroktonos (the Bulgar-Slayer; {{reign | 976 | 1025}}) and [[Constantine&nbsp;VIII]]. Anna was a Porphyrogenita, a legitimate daughter born in the special purple chamber of the Byzantine Emperor's Palace. Anna's hand was considered by Volodymyr such a prize that he allegedly became Christian (988) just to marry her.\n\n==German wife==\n[[File:Dobranega maria.jpeg|thumb|Maria Dobroniega of Kiev]]\nAnna is known to have predeceased Volodymyr by four years. [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], writing from contemporary accounts, mentions that [[Boleslaw I of Poland]] captured Volodymyr's widow during his raid on [[Kiev]] in 1018. The historians long had no clue as to identity of this wife. The emigre historian Nicholas Baumgarten, however, pointed to the controversial record of the \"Genealogia Welforum\" and the \"Historia Welforum Weingartensis\" that one daughter of Count Kuno von Oenningen (future Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Swabia|Konrad of Swabia]]) by \"filia Ottonis Magni imperatoris\" ([[Otto the Great]]'s daughter; possibly Rechlinda Otona [Regelindis], claimed by some as illegitimate daughter and by others legitimate, born from his first marriage with Edith of Wessex) married \"rex Rugorum\" (king of Russia). He interpreted this evidence as pertaining to Volodymyr's last wife.\n\nIt is believed that the only child of this alliance was '''[[Maria Dobroniega of Kiev|Dobronega]]''', or Maria, who married [[Casimir I of Poland]] between 1038 and 1042. As her father Volodymyr died about 25 years before that marriage and she was still young enough to bear at least five children, including two future Polish dukes ([[Boleslaw II of Poland]], who later became a king, and [[Wladyslaw Herman]]), it is thought probable that she was Volodymyr's daughter by the last marriage.\n\n===Yaroslav's parentage===\nThere is also a case for [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s descent from Anna. According to this theory, [[Nestor the Chronicler]] deliberately represented Yaroslav as Rogneda's son, because he systematically removed all information concerning Kievan ties with [[Byzantium]], spawning pro-Varangian bias (see [[Normanist theory]] for details). Proponents allege that Yaroslav's true age was falsified by Nestor, who attempted to represent him as 10 years older than he actually had been, in order to justify Yaroslav's seizure of the throne at the expense of his older brothers.\n\nThe [[Primary Chronicle]], for instance, states that Yaroslav died at the age of 76 in 1054 (thus putting his birth at 978), while dating Volodymyr's encounter and marriage to Yaroslav's purported mother, Rogneda, to 980.  Elsewhere, speaking about Yaroslav's rule in Novgorod (1016), Nestor says that Yaroslav was 28, thus putting his birth at 988.  The forensic analysis of Yaroslav's skeleton seems to have confirmed these suspicions, estimating Yaroslav's birth at ca. 988-990, after both the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus]] and Volodymyr's divorce of Rogneda. Consequently, it is assumed that Yaroslav was either Volodymyr's natural son born after the latter's baptism or his son by Anna.\n\n[[File:Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich with sons (Granovitaya palata, 1881-2) - detail.jpg|thumb|Prince Volodymyr Svyatoslavovich with sons]]\nHad Yaroslav an imperial Byzantine descent, he likely would not have stinted to advertise it. Some have seen the willingness of European kings to marry Yaroslav's daughters as an indication of this imperial descent.  Subsequent Polish chroniclers and historians, in particular, were eager to view Yaroslav as Anna's son.  Recent proponents invoke [[onomastic]] arguments, which have often proven decisive in the matters of medieval [[prosopography]], but these may be worthless in this case specifically because of the great shift to Christian names just then experienced in the Rus royal dynasty, an upheaval more than enough to explain all unprecedented names if they are Christian. It is curious that Yaroslav named his elder son [[Vladimir of Novgorod|Volodymyr]] (after his own father) and one of his daughters [[Anne of Kiev|Anna]] (as if after his own mother).  Also, there is a certain pattern in his sons having Slavic names (as Volodymyr), and his daughters having Greek names only (as Anna).  However, in the absence of better sources, Anna's maternity remains a pure speculation.\n\n==Obscure offspring==\nVolodymyr had several children whose maternity cannot be established with certainty. These include two sons, '''Stanislav''' of Smolensk and [[Sudislav|Sudislav of Pskov]], the latter outliving all of his siblings. There is also one daughter, named '''Predslava''', who was captured by Boleslaw I in Kiev and taken with him to [[Poland]] as a concubine. Another daughter, '''Premyslava''', is attested in numerous (though rather late) [[Hungary|Hungarian]] sources as the wife of Duke Ladislaus, one of the early [[Arpads|Arpadians]].\n\n== Footnotes ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Grand Princes of Kiev|Volodymyr I]]\n[[Category:Volodymyr the Great]]\n[[Category:Family by person]]\n[[Category:Children by person]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{multiple image|total_width=400\n|image1=Sviatopolk I of Kiev.jpg\n|image2=Boris Savvin.jpg\n|footer=Depictions of Vladimir's sons [[Sviatopolk I]] (left), [[Boris and Gleb]] (right)\n}}\nUntil baptism, [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] (c.958\u20131015) was described by [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] as ''a great profligate'' ({{lang-la|fornicator maximus}}).

Las Am\u00e9ricas usually receives a wide variety of long-, mid- and short-haul aircraft.\n\nThe airport is the second-busiest in the country, after [[Punta Cana International Airport]], and one of the largest in the Caribbean, handling 3.5 million passengers in 2015 through its air terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo/|title=BCRD - Estad\u00edsticas Econ\u00f3micas|website=www.bancentral.gov.do|access-date=2016-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203221506/http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo|archive-date=2017-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> And is also the busiest cargo hub in the Caribbean and Central America with 355,000,000 lbs of cargo transported in 2019\n\n== History ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport opened in 1959 as the official airport of [[Santo Domingo]]. The official name of the airport was changed in 2002 to \"Aeropuerto Internacional Las Am\u00e9ricas- Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez (AIJFPG)\" but is most commonly referred to as \"Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport\", or locally, \"Las Am\u00e9ricas Airport\" or \"El Aeropuerto\".\n\nUp until January 2020, the airport operates on private land which hasn't been paid to the original owners, the current administration has been plague with multiple lawsuits, with the lower courts siding with the land owners, the case is currently in the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 15, 1970, a [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]] [[DC-9]] that was flying to [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], crashed, killing all 102 persons on board (see: [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster]]).\n\n''Las Am\u00e9ricas'' was the hub for [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]], [[APA Dominicana International]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[PAWA Dominicana]], and a number of other, smaller airlines. Currently [[Servicios A\u00e9reos Profesionales|SAP Air]] is based there.\n\nLas Am\u00e9ricas also has served as a hub for airlines such as [[Aeromar L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Dominicanas]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[Aero Continente Dominicana]] and [[Queen Air]].\n[[File:Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport (14688446824).jpg|thumb|Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport terminal exterior]]\nRecently, the expressway leading from Santo Domingo to the airport (roughly 20&nbsp;km east of the city center) was expanded and modernised. The airport was also modernised, and two more terminals were added, including 20 more gates. The new expressway crosses a new [[suspension bridge]] which spans the [[Ozama River]], connecting traffic into the city's Elevated Freeway and Tunnel system onto the city's main street, Av. 27 de Febrero. A more scenic route following the coastal shore provides beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea and of the city. This secondary road crosses the Ozama River by means of a floating bridge, connecting traffic onto the Av. George Washington (el Malec\u00f3n) which leads into the heart of the colonial city.\n\n== Addition of northern terminal ==\nOn 18 April 2007, a new terminal was completed and opened for operations. It can accommodate four [[Boeing 747]]s simultaneously. This new terminal has four gates with boarding bridges, an air-conditioning system, and maintenance facilities for aircraft.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Runway ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport's runway direction is north\u2013south (designated 17\u201335). This runway is the largest in the country, and one of the largest in the Caribbean. With a length of 3,355&nbsp;m, it is able to support a [[Boeing 747]]. The runway of SDQ was last renovated in June 2008. The old taxi-way was also renovated and converted into a full runway while the old runway was being renovated, then it was converted back into a taxiway after the normal runway was finished. The runway accommodated the [[Antonov An-225]] to supply goods after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |title=Antonov-225 Delivered Humanitarian Aids to Japan |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |archivedate=2018-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |title=AN-225 Mriya / Super Heavy Transport |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |archivedate=2018-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n== Concourses ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas has five gates on the main satellite concourse (A), A2 through A6. Other gate facilities are for the flights departing from a parking in the taxiway. back in the 1960s and 70s the airport used to be much smaller, The original building was half the size of today's newest structure but with a still modern look.\n\nConcourse B has four gates (B1 through B4) and remote stand (P8). Terminal&nbsp;B now features a co-branded [[United Club|Copa Club]] operated jointly by [[United Airlines]] and [[Copa Airlines]], and a Private Lounge exclusive to members and business people.\n\nThe average number of daily flights in and out of Las Am\u00e9ricas ranges between 68 and 84 flights.

The airport is run by Aeropuertos Dominicanos Siglo XXI (AERODOM), a private corporation based in the Dominican Republic under a 25-year concession to [[Build\u2013operate\u2013transfer|build, operate, and transfer]] (BOT) six of the country's airports. Las Am\u00e9ricas usually receives a wide variety of long-, mid- and short-haul aircraft.\n\nThe airport is the second-busiest in the country, after [[Punta Cana International Airport]], and one of the largest in the Caribbean, handling 3.5 million passengers in 2015 through its air terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo/|title=BCRD - Estad\u00edsticas Econ\u00f3micas|website=www.bancentral.gov.do|access-date=2016-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203221506/http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo|archive-date=2017-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> And is also the busiest cargo hub in the Caribbean and Central America with 355,000,000 lbs of cargo transported in 2019\n\n== History ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport opened in 1959 as the official airport of [[Santo Domingo]]. The official name of the airport was changed in 2002 to \"Aeropuerto Internacional Las Am\u00e9ricas- Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez (AIJFPG)\" but is most commonly referred to as \"Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport\", or locally, \"Las Am\u00e9ricas Airport\" or \"El Aeropuerto\".\n\nUp until January 2020, the airport operates on private land which hasn't been paid to the original owners, the current administration has been plague with multiple lawsuits, with the lower courts siding with the land owners, the case is currently in the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 15, 1970, a [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]] [[DC-9]] that was flying to [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], crashed, killing all 102 persons on board (see: [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster]]).\n\n''Las Am\u00e9ricas'' was the hub for [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]], [[APA Dominicana International]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[PAWA Dominicana]], and a number of other, smaller airlines. Currently [[Servicios A\u00e9reos Profesionales|SAP Air]] is based there.\n\nLas Am\u00e9ricas also has served as a hub for airlines such as [[Aeromar L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Dominicanas]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[Aero Continente Dominicana]] and [[Queen Air]].\n[[File:Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport (14688446824).jpg|thumb|Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport terminal exterior]]\nRecently, the expressway leading from Santo Domingo to the airport (roughly 20&nbsp;km east of the city center) was expanded and modernised. The airport was also modernised, and two more terminals were added, including 20 more gates. The new expressway crosses a new [[suspension bridge]] which spans the [[Ozama River]], connecting traffic into the city's Elevated Freeway and Tunnel system onto the city's main street, Av. 27 de Febrero. A more scenic route following the coastal shore provides beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea and of the city. This secondary road crosses the Ozama River by means of a floating bridge, connecting traffic onto the Av. George Washington (el Malec\u00f3n) which leads into the heart of the colonial city.\n\n== Addition of northern terminal ==\nOn 18 April 2007, a new terminal was completed and opened for operations. It can accommodate four [[Boeing 747]]s simultaneously. This new terminal has four gates with boarding bridges, an air-conditioning system, and maintenance facilities for aircraft.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Runway ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport's runway direction is north\u2013south (designated 17\u201335). This runway is the largest in the country, and one of the largest in the Caribbean. With a length of 3,355&nbsp;m, it is able to support a [[Boeing 747]]. The runway of SDQ was last renovated in June 2008. The old taxi-way was also renovated and converted into a full runway while the old runway was being renovated, then it was converted back into a taxiway after the normal runway was finished. The runway accommodated the [[Antonov An-225]] to supply goods after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |title=Antonov-225 Delivered Humanitarian Aids to Japan |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |archivedate=2018-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |title=AN-225 Mriya / Super Heavy Transport |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |archivedate=2018-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n== Concourses ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas has five gates on the main satellite concourse (A), A2 through A6. Other gate facilities are for the flights departing from a parking in the taxiway. back in the 1960s and 70s the airport used to be much smaller, The original building was half the size of today's newest structure but with a still modern look.\n\nConcourse B has four gates (B1 through B4) and remote stand (P8). Terminal&nbsp;B now features a co-branded [[United Club|Copa Club]] operated jointly by [[United Airlines]] and [[Copa Airlines]], and a Private Lounge exclusive to members and business people.\n\nThe average number of daily flights in and out of Las Am\u00e9ricas ranges between 68 and 84 flights.

It was originally named Imperial Training Camp and its first season prepared 40 enthusiasts for the professional [[PHP]]/[[MySQL]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[Android (operating system)|Android]] fields. 20 of those 40 graduates were hired by Imperia Online JSC, and the rest were recommended to other software companies.\n\nIn 2014 the second season of IO's Training Camp drew even higher interest and this time there were 80 students, divided into 4 groups of 20: 62 graduated, of which 30 were hired by Imperia Online JSC.\n\nFor the third season Imperia Online JSC was joined by another Bulgarian company - Trader.bg - and the school was renamed to \u201cIT Talents Training Camp\u201d. By that time the courses are [[PHP]]/ [[MySQL]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/ [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[JavaScript]], [[Objective-C]]/[[iOS]], and [[Java SE]] / [[Java EE]].  In January 2015 the third season ended with a big part of the 115 participants getting hired.\n\nEvery year, there are 180 cadets successfully graduated from the academy. IT Talents Training Camp is already partnering with over 80 companies in the IT industry, to provide them qualified IT specialists. The initiative registers more than 2000 applications per season, from which around 200 most motivated candidates are allowed to enter the intensive 5-month courses. IT Talents is an NGO since 2016 and is provided with Google Ad Grants, enabling free AdWords campaigns. As of November 2017, The Municipality of Burgas organizes a 5-month program in cooperation with IT Talents. The training is again completely free and the applications are done by filling in a short registration form.\n\n== Outsourcing ==\nIn May 2015 Imperia Online JSC founded a private company for IT outsourcing called Imperia Mobile Ltd.

The attractiveness of the Polish landscape and associated [[folklore]] had been awakened in him by Feliks Karczewski, his uncle and long-time guardian, who had invited future novelist [[Adolf Dygasi\u0144ski]] to his estate, to act as Jacek's home tutor.<ref name=\"baza-sztuki\" />\n\n==Artistic career==\n[[File:Malczewski melancholia.jpg|thumb|320px|''Melancholia'' (1894), [[National Museum, Pozna\u0144|National Museum]] in [[Pozna\u0144]]]]\nMalczewski moved to [[Krak\u00f3w]] at age 17, and began his artistic education in 1872 under the watchful eye of Polish painter and draughtsman {{Interlanguage link|Leon Piccard|fr}} and attended his first art classes in the workshop of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141uszczkiewicz]] at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]]. A year later, in 1873, assessed by [[Jan Matejko]] himself, Malczewski formally enrolled at the School, and studied with \u0141uszczkiewicz, Feliks Szynalewski and [[Florian Cynk]]. In 1876 he went to [[Paris]] and studied for a year at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], in the studio of [[Henri Lehmann]]. He next moved to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Suisse]].<ref name=\"baza-sztuki\" /><ref name=\"gazeta.pl\" />\n\nMalczewski had already begun master classes with Jan Matejko in 1875 before embarking on the trip to France, and completed them in 1879 after his return from abroad. In spite of considerable stylistic differences between them, Malczewski was greatly influenced by Matejko's historical painting filled with [[neo-romantic]] metaphor and patriotic themes. In 1879, Malczewski completed a course in composition under Matejko.<ref>[http://culture.pl/en/artist/jacek-malczewski Jacek Malczewski] at [http://culture.pl/en/artist/jacek-malczewski Culture.pl]</ref> He was equally impressed with the dramatic art of earlier Polish romantic painter [[Artur Grottger]]. His painting revolved around a few carefully selected motifs, constantly retold and expanded according to mythology and filled with national symbols. His own imagination enabled Malczewski to channel his creativity and let new aesthetic ideas emerge giving rise to what became Poland's school of Symbolism.<ref name=\"baza-sztuki\" />\n\n===Inspiration===\nOver the course of some 30 years between 1885 and 1916, Malczewski regularly visited Paris, [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]]. He made several trips to [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. He also took part in an archaeological expedition organized by his friend [[Karol Lanckoro\u0144ski]]. He drew his inspiration from a wide variety of sources often exotic or biblical, and translated them back into Polish folklore, tradition and motifs in his own painting.<ref name=\"info-poland\" /> His most famous canvases include ''B\u0142\u0119dne ko\u0142o'' (Vicious Circle, 1895\u201397), ''Melancholia'' (1890\u20131894), ''Natchnienie malarza'' (Painter's Muse, 1897), ''Wizja'' (A vision, 1912), the ''[[Thanatos]]'' series, and ''Bajki'' (Fables).

On his mother's side, he was related to the [[Theodore de Korwin Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] family whom they often visited on their [[Masovia]]n country estate in [[Cyg\u00f3w]]. The attractiveness of the Polish landscape and associated [[folklore]] had been awakened in him by Feliks Karczewski, his uncle and long-time guardian, who had invited future novelist [[Adolf Dygasi\u0144ski]] to his estate, to act as Jacek's home tutor.<ref name=\"baza-sztuki\" />\n\n==Artistic career==\n[[File:Malczewski melancholia.jpg|thumb|320px|''Melancholia'' (1894), [[National Museum, Pozna\u0144|National Museum]] in [[Pozna\u0144]]]]\nMalczewski moved to [[Krak\u00f3w]] at age 17, and began his artistic education in 1872 under the watchful eye of Polish painter and draughtsman {{Interlanguage link|Leon Piccard|fr}} and attended his first art classes in the workshop of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141uszczkiewicz]] at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]]. A year later, in 1873, assessed by [[Jan Matejko]] himself, Malczewski formally enrolled at the School, and studied with \u0141uszczkiewicz, Feliks Szynalewski and [[Florian Cynk]]. In 1876 he went to [[Paris]] and studied for a year at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], in the studio of [[Henri Lehmann]]. He next moved to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Suisse]].<ref name=\"baza-sztuki\" /><ref name=\"gazeta.pl\" />\n\nMalczewski had already begun master classes with Jan Matejko in 1875 before embarking on the trip to France, and completed them in 1879 after his return from abroad. In spite of considerable stylistic differences between them, Malczewski was greatly influenced by Matejko's historical painting filled with [[neo-romantic]] metaphor and patriotic themes. In 1879, Malczewski completed a course in composition under Matejko.<ref>[http://culture.pl/en/artist/jacek-malczewski Jacek Malczewski] at [http://culture.pl/en/artist/jacek-malczewski Culture.pl]</ref> He was equally impressed with the dramatic art of earlier Polish romantic painter [[Artur Grottger]]. His painting revolved around a few carefully selected motifs, constantly retold and expanded according to mythology and filled with national symbols. His own imagination enabled Malczewski to channel his creativity and let new aesthetic ideas emerge giving rise to what became Poland's school of Symbolism.<ref name=\"baza-sztuki\" />\n\n===Inspiration===\nOver the course of some 30 years between 1885 and 1916, Malczewski regularly visited Paris, [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]]. He made several trips to [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. He also took part in an archaeological expedition organized by his friend [[Karol Lanckoro\u0144ski]]. He drew his inspiration from a wide variety of sources often exotic or biblical, and translated them back into Polish folklore, tradition and motifs in his own painting.<ref name=\"info-poland\" /> His most famous canvases include ''B\u0142\u0119dne ko\u0142o'' (Vicious Circle, 1895\u201397), ''Melancholia'' (1890\u20131894), ''Natchnienie malarza'' (Painter's Muse, 1897), ''Wizja'' (A vision, 1912), the ''[[Thanatos]]'' series, and ''Bajki'' (Fables).

The sixth game was an illustration of just how badly chess engines could play in some positions at the time.

By the end of the game, Deep Blue's pieces were crammed into its queenside corner, with no moves to make aside from shuffling its king.

This is possible as Deep Blue moved 44.Kf1 instead of an alternate move of its king. Regarding the end of game 2 and 44.Kf1 in particular, chess journalist [[Mig Greengard]] in the ''[[Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine|Game Over]]'' film states, \"It turns out, that the position in, here at the end is actually a draw, and that, one of Deep Blue's final moves was a terrible error, because Deep Blue has two choices here. It can move its king here or move its king over here. It picked the wrong place to step.\" Another person in that film, four-time US champion [[Yasser Seirawan]], then concludes that \"The computer had left its king a little un-defended. And Garry could have threatened a perpetual check, not a win but a perpetual check.\"\n\nModern chess engines consider the final position as better (but maybe not won) for White.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://analysis.cpuchess.com/?fen=1r6%2F5kp1%2FRqQb1p1p%2F1p1PpP2%2F1Pp1B3%2F2P4P%2F6P1%2F5K2%20b%20-%20-%2014%2045&lmove=Ra6 | title=Online computer analysis of the final position of game 2 | accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chess.com/blog/FirebrandX/kasparov---deep-blue-1997-everyone-was-wrong | title=Kasparov \u2013 Deep Blue 1997: History gets it wrong! | accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> The mistake was actually not 44.Kf1 but 45.Ra6{{chesspunc|?!}} when instead 45.Qd7+ was a clear win (White will exchange queens, bring his king to e4 and his bishop to g6 after which Black sooner or later is in [[zugzwang]], and will be mated, or lose his b5-pawn, or the d5-pawn advances, opening roads for the white king).\n\nThe move that surprised Kasparov enough to allege cheating was 36.axb5! axb5 37.Be4! after which Black is lost.

Although this is nowadays a common tactic, it was a relatively new idea at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessbase.com/columns/column.asp?pid=149 | title=Mig on Chess #178: All the News That's Fit to Mock | publisher=Chessbase.com | work=Daily Chess Columns | accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref> Despite this anti-computer tactic, the game was drawn.\n\n{{block indent |1=Kasparov vs. Deep Blue <br />1.d3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c4 Nf6 4.a3 d6 5.Nc3 Be7 6.g3 0-0 7.Bg2 Be6 8.0-0 Qd7 9.Ng5 Bf5 10.e4 Bg4 11.f3 Bh5 12.Nh3 Nd4 13.Nf2 h6 14.Be3 c5 15.b4 b6 16.Rb1 Kh8 17.Rb2 a6 18.bxc5 bxc5 19.Bh3 Qc7 20.Bg4 Bg6 21.f4 exf4 22.gxf4 Qa5 23.Bd2 Qxa3 24.Ra2 Qb3 25.f5 Qxd1 26.Bxd1 Bh7 27.Nh3 Rfb8 28.Nf4 Bd8 29.Nfd5 Nc6 30.Bf4 Ne5 31.Ba4 Nxd5 32.Nxd5 a5 33.Bb5 Ra7 34.Kg2 g5 35.Bxe5+ dxe5 36.f6 Bg6 37.h4 gxh4 38.Kh3 Kg8 39.Kxh4 Kh7 40.Kg4 Bc7 41.Nxc7 Rxc7 42.Rxa5 Rd8 43.Rf3 Kh8 44.Kh4 Kg8 45.Ra3 Kh8 46.Ra6 Kh7 47.Ra3 Kh8 48.Ra6 \u00bd\u2013\u00bd}}\n\n===Game 4 {{anchor|1997 Game 4}}===\n''May 7''.

Before the sixth game, the overall score was even: 2\u00bd\u20132\u00bd. As in game 4, Kasparov played the [[Caro\u2013Kann Defence]]. Deep Blue made a knight [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]] which wrecked Kasparov's defence and forced him to resign in less than twenty moves. As Kasparov later recounts, he chose to play a dubious opening in an effort to put Deep Blue out of its comfort zone. Although the knight sacrifice is a well known refutation, Kasparov reasoned that an engine wouldn't play the move without a concrete gain. The only reason Deep Blue played in that way, as was later revealed, was because that very same day of the game the creators of Deep Blue had inputted the variation into the opening database.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n{{block indent |1=Deep Blue vs. Kasparov <br />1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 5.Ng5 Ngf6 6.Bd3 e6 7.N1f3 h6 (''diagram'') 8.Nxe6 Qe7 9.0-0 fxe6 10.Bg6+ Kd8 11.Bf4 b5 12.a4 Bb7 13.Re1 Nd5 14.Bg3 Kc8 15.axb5 cxb5 16.Qd3 Bc6 17.Bf5 exf5 18.Rxe7 Bxe7 19.c4 1\u20130}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol]], similar but with Go\n* [[Arimaa]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue inspired the creation of a new game designed to be difficult for computers, yet playable with a chess set.\n* ''[[Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine]]''\n* [[List of chess games]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web | url=http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/ | title=The official site of the matches | publisher=IBM Research | work=Deep Blue | accessdate=2007-04-17}}\n*{{cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?pid=29912&pid2=15940 | website=[[Chessgames.com]] | title=Garry Kasparov vs Deep Blue, 12 games | accessdate=2007-04-18}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Gardner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gardner\n|year=2001\n|title=A Gardner's Workout: Training the Mind and Entertaining the Spirit\n|publisher=A K Peters\n|isbn=978-1-56881-120-8\n|pages=91\u201395}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last1=Goodman|first1=David\n|last2=Keene|first2=Raymond|authorlink2=Raymond Keene\n|year=1997\n|title=Man Versus Machine: Kasparov Versus Deep Blue\n|publisher=H3\n|isbn=978-1888281064}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Hsu|first=Feng-hsiung|authorlink=Feng-hsiung Hsu\n|year=2002\n|title=Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion\n|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]\n|isbn=0-691-09065-3\n|postscript=<!--None-->}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last1=Khodarkovsky|first1=Michael\n|last2=Shamkovich|first2=Leonoid|authorlink2=Leonid Shamkovich\n|year=1997\n|title=A New Era: World Championship Chess in the Age of Deep Blue\n|publisher=Ballantine\n|isbn=978-0345408907}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=King|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel King (chess player)\n|year=1997\n|title=Kasparov v.

The sixth game was an illustration of just how badly chess engines could play in some positions at the time. Employing anti-computer tactics and keeping the focus of the game on long-term planning, Kasparov slowly improved his position throughout the mid-game while Deep Blue wasted time doing very little to improve its position. By the end of the game, Deep Blue's pieces were crammed into its queenside corner, with no moves to make aside from shuffling its king.

This is possible as Deep Blue moved 44.Kf1 instead of an alternate move of its king. Regarding the end of game 2 and 44.Kf1 in particular, chess journalist [[Mig Greengard]] in the ''[[Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine|Game Over]]'' film states, \"It turns out, that the position in, here at the end is actually a draw, and that, one of Deep Blue's final moves was a terrible error, because Deep Blue has two choices here. It can move its king here or move its king over here. It picked the wrong place to step.\" Another person in that film, four-time US champion [[Yasser Seirawan]], then concludes that, \"The computer had left its king a little un-defended. And Garry could have threatened a perpetual check, not a win but a perpetual check.\"\n\nModern chess engines consider the final position as better (but maybe not won) for White.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://analysis.cpuchess.com/?fen=1r6%2F5kp1%2FRqQb1p1p%2F1p1PpP2%2F1Pp1B3%2F2P4P%2F6P1%2F5K2%20b%20-%20-%2014%2045&lmove=Ra6 | title=Online computer analysis of the final position of game 2 | accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chess.com/blog/FirebrandX/kasparov---deep-blue-1997-everyone-was-wrong | title=Kasparov \u2013 Deep Blue 1997: History gets it wrong! | accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> The mistake was actually not 44.Kf1 but 45.Ra6{{chesspunc|?!}} when instead 45.Qd7+ was a clear win (White will exchange queens, bring his king to e4 and his bishop to g6 after which Black sooner or later is in [[zugzwang]], and will be mated, or lose his b5-pawn, or the d5-pawn advances, opening roads for the white king).\n\nThe move that surprised Kasparov enough to allege cheating was 36.axb5! axb5 37.Be4! after which Black is lost.

As Kasparov later recounts, he chose to play a dubious opening in an effort to put Deep Blue out of its comfort zone. Although the knight sacrifice is a well known refutation, Kasparov reasoned that an engine wouldn't play the move without a concrete gain. The only reason Deep Blue played in that way, as was later revealed, was because that very same day of the game the creators of Deep Blue had inputted the variation into the opening database.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n{{block indent |1=Deep Blue vs. Kasparov <br />1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 5.Ng5 Ngf6 6.Bd3 e6 7.N1f3 h6 (''diagram'') 8.Nxe6 Qe7 9.0-0 fxe6 10.Bg6+ Kd8 11.Bf4 b5 12.a4 Bb7 13.Re1 Nd5 14.Bg3 Kc8 15.axb5 cxb5 16.Qd3 Bc6 17.Bf5 exf5 18.Rxe7 Bxe7 19.c4 1\u20130}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol]], similar but with Go\n* [[Arimaa]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue inspired the creation of a new game designed to be difficult for computers, yet playable with a chess set.\n* ''[[Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine]]''\n* [[List of chess games]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web | url=http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/ | title=The official site of the matches | publisher=IBM Research | work=Deep Blue | accessdate=2007-04-17}}\n*{{cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?pid=29912&pid2=15940 | website=[[Chessgames.com]] | title=Garry Kasparov vs Deep Blue, 12 games | accessdate=2007-04-18}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Gardner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gardner\n|year=2001\n|title=A Gardner's Workout: Training the Mind and Entertaining the Spirit\n|publisher=A K Peters\n|isbn=978-1-56881-120-8\n|pages=91\u201395}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last1=Goodman|first1=David\n|last2=Keene|first2=Raymond|authorlink2=Raymond Keene\n|year=1997\n|title=Man Versus Machine: Kasparov Versus Deep Blue\n|publisher=H3\n|isbn=978-1888281064}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Hsu|first=Feng-hsiung|authorlink=Feng-hsiung Hsu\n|year=2002\n|title=Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion\n|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]\n|isbn=0-691-09065-3\n|postscript=<!--None-->}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last1=Khodarkovsky|first1=Michael\n|last2=Shamkovich|first2=Leonoid|authorlink2=Leonid Shamkovich\n|year=1997\n|title=A New Era: World Championship Chess in the Age of Deep Blue\n|publisher=Ballantine\n|isbn=978-0345408907}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=King|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel King (chess player)\n|year=1997\n|title=Kasparov v.
