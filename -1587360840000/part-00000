The festival is Canada's largest film festival, receiving 4,209 submissions in 2008.  Of this total, 312 films were screened coming from 64 different countries.  TIFF creates an annual economic impact of $135 million CAD.  Aided by over 2,000 volunteers, 100 full-time staff members and 500 seasonal or part-time staff are responsible for organizing the festival.  Two screenings of each of the invited films are presented to the public and at least one screening is provided for press and industry.  The 2009 festival contained 19 different Programmes, or categories of films.  After the ten days of film, the Awards reception was held at Intercontinental Hotel on Front Street in Toronto.\n\nPerhaps the most prestigious of the awards was bestowed to [[Lee Daniels]]'s ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'': based on the novel ''Push'' by Sapphire.  This award was the 2009 Cadillac People's Choice Award and is based solely on votes by Festival audiences.  This award carries a $15,000 cash prize and also comes with a custom made award from [[Cadillac]].  It is widely considered to be the most prestigious because it has had the greatest impact on audiences and inspires film distributors to sign the winning film for larger international releases.  Last year's winner ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' directed by [[Danny Boyle]], went on to reap huge international spotlight which culminated at the 2009 [[Academy Awards]] where it won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Lee Daniel's ''Precious'' was also a big Oscar contender as it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director, however it lost to ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' and its helmer [[Katheryn Bigelow]].  The First runner-up was [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Mao's Last Dancer (film)|Mao's Last Dancer]]'' and the second runner-up was [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]'s ''[[Micmacs (film)|Micmacs]]''.\n\nThe City of Toronto and Astral Media's The Movie Network Award for Best Canadian Feature Film went to ''[[Cairo Time]]'' directed by [[Ruba Nadda]].  Sponsored by Astral Media's the Movie Network and the City of Toronto, this award came with a cash prize of $30,000.\n\nFuture endeavors by the TIFF will be aided by the ongoing construction of TIFF [[Bell Lightbox]], a {{convert|1750000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility with an estimated annual economic impact of over $200 million.  Complete with 5 cinemas, learning studios, galleries and a rooftop lounge, this will become the hub of TIFF in 2010 when construction is scheduled to be completed.\n\n===Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight===\nMore than 1,500 people, including prominent filmmakers, academics, and writers signed a letter of protest directed at the Toronto International Film Festival regarding its decision to spotlight [[Tel Aviv]] and the work of 10 Israeli filmmakers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/14/no_celebration_of_occupation_1_500 |title=No Celebration of Occupation: 1,500 Artists and Writers Sign Letter Protesting Toronto Film Festival Decision to Spotlight Tel Aviv |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/tiff-2009/tiff-focus-on-tel-aviv-draws-protests/article1273755/ |title=TIFF focus on Tel Aviv draws protests |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=September 2, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Posner |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>  The protest leaders emphasized that it is not a call for a boycott.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/ |title=We don't feel like celebrating with Israel this year |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrffOkVn?url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/ |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |first=Naomi |last=Klein |url-status=live |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"JVFP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/publish/article_1212.shtml |title=Fighting the Lies- Toronto International Film Festival |work=[[Jewish Voice for Peace]] |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrffoj8K?url=http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/publish/article_1212.shtml |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  The original protest letter in part reads:<blockquote>\n\n:\"As members of the Canadian and international film, culture and media arts communities, we are deeply disturbed by [TIFF's] decision to host a celebratory spotlight on Tel Aviv.  We protest that TIFF, whether intentionally or not, has become complicit in the Israeli propaganda machine. We do not protest the individual Israeli filmmakers included in City to City, nor do we in any way suggest that Israeli films should be unwelcome at TIFF. However, especially in the wake of this year's brutal assault on Gaza, we object to the use of such an important international festival in staging a propaganda campaign on behalf of what South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former US President Jimmy Carter, and UN General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann have all characterized as an apartheid regime.\"<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Lim|first=Audrea|publisher=Verso Books|title=The Case for Sanctions Against Israel|pages=72|author2=[[Joel Beinin]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://torontodeclaration.blogspot.com/2009/09/toronto-declaration-no-celebration-of.html |title=The Toronto Declaration: No Celebration of Occupation |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013 |work=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/143443/an_historical_shift%3A_american_jews_rethink_israel?paging=off |title=An Historical Shift: American Jews Rethink Israel |date=October 22, 2009 |work=[[AlterNet]] |first1=Philip |last1=Weiss |first2=Adam |last2=Horowitz |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe signatories and supporters include [[Ken Loach]], [[David Byrne]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[Danny Glover]],<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/> [[John Greyson]],<ref name=\"CBCNewsAug282009\"/> [[Viggo Mortensen]] and the American Jewish group [[Jewish Voice for Peace]].<ref name=\"JVFP\"/>\n\n[[John Greyson]]'s letter of protest highlighted an interview \"Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin gave to ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'' in which he described the TIFF spotlight as a culmination of his year-long Brand Israel campaign, which included ads on buses, radio and television.\"<ref name=\"CBCNewsAug282009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2009/08/29/greyson-tiff-pullout.html |title=Canadian director protests TIFF Tel Aviv spotlight |work=[[CBC News]] |date=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cjnews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15198&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=86 Brand Israel set to launch in GTA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912044103/http://www.cjnews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15198&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=86 |date=2009-09-12 }}, ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', August 21, 2009.</ref> Greyson claims that \"This isn't the right year to celebrate Brand Israel, or to demonstrate an ostrich-like indifference to the realities (cinematic and otherwise) of the region, or to pointedly ignore the international economic boycott campaign against Israel.\"<ref name=\"CBCNewsAug282009\"/>\n\nThe protest letter was met with condemnation by some, such as [[Simcha Jacobovici]], \"a Toronto filmmaker who recently moved with his family to Israel, noted in a statement that the Palestinian government in Gaza had recently called a U.N. proposal to teach the Holocaust in Palestinian schools a war crime.\"  Jacobovici asked \"Why does [protest supporter John Greyson] want to align himself with Holocaust deniers?\"<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/>  Others accused those who signed the protest letter as engaging in a boycott of Israel films.<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/>\n\nRabbi [[Marvin Hier]], the founder of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], has stated that \"it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by [[Hamas]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/693960 |title=To criticize Israel is a dangerous thing in today's Canada |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrfeG2KT?url=http://www.thestar.com/comment/article/693960 |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |url-status=live |first=Kathy |last=Wazana |df= }}</ref>\n\nPatrick Goldstein, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', wrote against the protest and made an analogy to actions by musician [[Paul Simon]]:\n:\"At the height of apartheid in South Africa, Paul Simon made \"Graceland\", an album of glorious music with South African musicians. He was criticized at the time for breaking a worldwide cultural boycott, but Simon believed that exposing the musicians' gifts to the world far outweighed any tacit endorsement his use of South African musicians would have provided for the country's repressive regime.  History long ago proved him right. The same openness should apply to a film festival.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-bigpicture12-2009sep12,0,6666441.story |title=Protest over Israel roils Toronto Film Festival |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 12, 2009 |first=Patrick |last=Goldstein |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the protest, a number of Hollywood stars circulated a counter-protest letter on September 15, 2009.  This letter,  which appeared simultaneously in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', included signatories [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Patricia Heaton]], [[Jacob Richler]], [[Noah Richler]], [[George F. Walker]] and [[Moses Znaimer]]. The letter said:<blockquote>Anyone who has actually seen recent Israeli cinema, movies that are political and personal, comic and tragic, often critical, knows they are in no way a propaganda arm for any government policy. Blacklisting them only stifles the exchange of cultural knowledge that artists should be the first to defend and protect.<ref name=haaretz>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1114902.html |title=Hollywood Jews hit back at protest of Toronto Film Fest |first1=Natasha |last1=Mozgovaya |first2=Itamar |last2=Zohar |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2009 <!--DASHBot--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203072254/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1114902.html |archivedate=3 December 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJane Fonda, in a posting on ''Huffington Post'', says that she now regrets some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it \"was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.\"  She continued writing \"the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-fonda/expanding-the-narrative_b_286406.html |title=Expanding the Narrative |first=Jane |last=Fonda |authorlink=Jane Fonda |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The festival is Canada's largest film festival, receiving 4,209 submissions in 2008.  Of this total, 312 films were screened coming from 64 different countries.  TIFF creates an annual economic impact of $135 million CAD.  Aided by over 2,000 volunteers, 100 full-time staff members and 500 seasonal or part-time staff are responsible for organizing the festival.  Two screenings of each of the invited films are presented to the public and at least one screening is provided for press and industry.  The 2009 festival contained 19 different Programmes, or categories of films.  After the ten days of film, the Awards reception was held at Intercontinental Hotel on Front Street in Toronto.\n\nPerhaps the most prestigious of the awards was bestowed to [[Lee Daniels]]'s ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'': based on the novel ''Push'' by Sapphire.  This award was the 2009 Cadillac People's Choice Award and is based solely on votes by Festival audiences.  This award carries a $15,000 cash prize and also comes with a custom made award from [[Cadillac]].  It is widely considered to be the most prestigious because it has had the greatest impact on audiences and inspires film distributors to sign the winning film for larger international releases.  Last year's winner ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' directed by [[Danny Boyle]], went on to reap huge international spotlight which culminated at the 2009 [[Academy Awards]] where it won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Lee Daniel's ''Precious'' was also a big Oscar contender as it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director, however it lost to ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' and its helmer [[Katheryn Bigelow]].  The First runner-up was [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Mao's Last Dancer (film)|Mao's Last Dancer]]'' and the second runner-up was [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]'s ''[[Micmacs (film)|Micmacs]]''.\n\nThe City of Toronto and Astral Media's The Movie Network Award for Best Canadian Feature Film went to ''[[Cairo Time]]'' directed by [[Ruba Nadda]].  Sponsored by Astral Media's the Movie Network and the City of Toronto, this award came with a cash prize of $30,000.\n\nFuture endeavors by the TIFF will be aided by the ongoing construction of TIFF [[Bell Lightbox]], a {{convert|1750000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility with an estimated annual economic impact of over $200 million.  Complete with 5 cinemas, learning studios, galleries and a rooftop lounge, this will become the hub of TIFF in 2010 when construction is scheduled to be completed.\n\n===Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight===\nMore than 1,500 people, including prominent filmmakers, academics, and writers signed a letter of protest directed at the Toronto International Film Festival regarding its decision to spotlight [[Tel Aviv]] and the work of 10 Israeli filmmakers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/14/no_celebration_of_occupation_1_500 |title=No Celebration of Occupation: 1,500 Artists and Writers Sign Letter Protesting Toronto Film Festival Decision to Spotlight Tel Aviv |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/tiff-2009/tiff-focus-on-tel-aviv-draws-protests/article1273755/ |title=TIFF focus on Tel Aviv draws protests |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=September 2, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Posner |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>  The protest leaders emphasized that it is not a call for a boycott.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/ |title=We don't feel like celebrating with Israel this year |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrffOkVn?url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/we-dont-feel-like-celebrating-with-israel-this-year/article1278582/ |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |first=Naomi |last=Klein |url-status=live |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"JVFP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/publish/article_1212.shtml |title=Fighting the Lies- Toronto International Film Festival |work=[[Jewish Voice for Peace]] |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrffoj8K?url=http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/publish/article_1212.shtml |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  The original protest letter in part reads:<blockquote>\n\n:\"As members of the Canadian and international film, culture and media arts communities, we are deeply disturbed by [TIFF's] decision to host a celebratory spotlight on Tel Aviv.  We protest that TIFF, whether intentionally or not, has become complicit in the Israeli propaganda machine. We do not protest the individual Israeli filmmakers included in City to City, nor do we in any way suggest that Israeli films should be unwelcome at TIFF. However, especially in the wake of this year's brutal assault on Gaza, we object to the use of such an important international festival in staging a propaganda campaign on behalf of what South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former US President Jimmy Carter, and UN General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann have all characterized as an apartheid regime.\"<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Lim|first=Audrea|publisher=Verso Books|title=The Case for Sanctions Against Israel|pages=72|author2=[[Joel Beinin]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://torontodeclaration.blogspot.com/2009/09/toronto-declaration-no-celebration-of.html |title=The Toronto Declaration: No Celebration of Occupation |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013 |work=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/143443/an_historical_shift%3A_american_jews_rethink_israel?paging=off |title=An Historical Shift: American Jews Rethink Israel |date=October 22, 2009 |work=[[AlterNet]] |first1=Philip |last1=Weiss |first2=Adam |last2=Horowitz |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe signatories and supporters include [[Ken Loach]], [[David Byrne]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[Danny Glover]],<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/> [[John Greyson]],<ref name=\"CBCNewsAug282009\"/> [[Viggo Mortensen]] and the American Jewish group [[Jewish Voice for Peace]].<ref name=\"JVFP\"/>\n\n[[John Greyson]]'s letter of protest highlighted an interview \"Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin gave to ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'' in which he described the TIFF spotlight as a culmination of his year-long Brand Israel campaign, which included ads on buses, radio and television.\"<ref name=\"CBCNewsAug282009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2009/08/29/greyson-tiff-pullout.html |title=Canadian director protests TIFF Tel Aviv spotlight |work=[[CBC News]] |date=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cjnews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15198&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=86 Brand Israel set to launch in GTA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912044103/http://www.cjnews.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15198&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=86 |date=2009-09-12 }}, ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', August 21, 2009.</ref> Greyson claims that \"This isn't the right year to celebrate Brand Israel, or to demonstrate an ostrich-like indifference to the realities (cinematic and otherwise) of the region, or to pointedly ignore the international economic boycott campaign against Israel.\"<ref name=\"CBCNewsAug282009\"/>\n\nThe protest letter was met with condemnation by some, such as [[Simcha Jacobovici]], \"a Toronto filmmaker who recently moved with his family to Israel, noted in a statement that the Palestinian government in Gaza had recently called a U.N. proposal to teach the Holocaust in Palestinian schools a war crime.\"  Jacobovici asked \"Why does [protest supporter John Greyson] want to align himself with Holocaust deniers?\"<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/>  Others accused those who signed the protest letter as engaging in a boycott of Israel films.<ref name=\"GlobeAndMailSept82009\"/>\n\nRabbi [[Marvin Hier]], the founder of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], has stated that \"it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by [[Hamas]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/693960 |title=To criticize Israel is a dangerous thing in today's Canada |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrfeG2KT?url=http://www.thestar.com/comment/article/693960 |archivedate=September 17, 2009 |url-status=live |first=Kathy |last=Wazana |df= }}</ref>\n\nPatrick Goldstein, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', wrote against the protest and made an analogy to actions by musician [[Paul Simon]]:\n:\"At the height of apartheid in South Africa, Paul Simon made \"Graceland\", an album of glorious music with South African musicians. He was criticized at the time for breaking a worldwide cultural boycott, but Simon believed that exposing the musicians' gifts to the world far outweighed any tacit endorsement his use of South African musicians would have provided for the country's repressive regime.  History long ago proved him right. The same openness should apply to a film festival.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-bigpicture12-2009sep12,0,6666441.story |title=Protest over Israel roils Toronto Film Festival |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 12, 2009 |first=Patrick |last=Goldstein |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the protest, a number of Hollywood stars circulated a counter-protest letter on September 15, 2009.  This letter,  which appeared simultaneously in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', included signatories [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Patricia Heaton]], [[Jacob Richler]], [[Noah Richler]], [[George F. Walker]] and [[Moses Znaimer]]. The letter said:<blockquote>Anyone who has actually seen recent Israeli cinema, movies that are political and personal, comic and tragic, often critical, knows they are in no way a propaganda arm for any government policy. Blacklisting them only stifles the exchange of cultural knowledge that artists should be the first to defend and protect.<ref name=haaretz>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1114902.html |title=Hollywood Jews hit back at protest of Toronto Film Fest |first1=Natasha |last1=Mozgovaya |first2=Itamar |last2=Zohar |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2009 <!--DASHBot--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203072254/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1114902.html |archivedate=3 December 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJane Fonda, in a posting on ''Huffington Post'', says that she now regrets some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it \"was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.\"  She continued writing \"the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-fonda/expanding-the-narrative_b_286406.html |title=Expanding the Narrative |first=Jane |last=Fonda |authorlink=Jane Fonda |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is also known as Chulup\u00ed and Ashluslay, and in older sources has been called Ashlusl\u00e9, Suhin, Suj\u00edn, Chunup\u00ed, Churup\u00ed, Chorop\u00ed, and other variant spellings of these names. Nivacl\u00e9 speakers are found in the Chaco, in Paraguay in [[Presidente Hayes Department]], and [[Boquer\u00f3n Department]], and in Argentina in [[Salta Province]].\n\nNivacl\u00e9 is complex both in its phonology and morphology. Much of what is handled in syntactic constructions in many other languages is signalled in Nivacl\u00e9 by its rich bound morphology and clitics. Nivacl\u00e9 has several linguistic traits that are rare elsewhere in the world or even unique.\n\n== Phonology ==\nIts phonemic inventory has 21 ''consonants'' and 6 ''vowels'', including glottalized (ejective) stops and affricates, and a unique phoneme, /k\u0361l/.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|last2=Grondona|first2=Ver\u00f3nica|date=2012|title=Linguistic Acculturation in Nivacl\u00e9 and Chorote|jstor=10.1086/665672|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=78|issue=3|pages=335\u2013367|doi=10.1086/665672}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Vowels\n!\n!Front\n!Back\n|-\n!Close\n|i\n|u\n|-\n!Close-mid\n|e\n|o\n|-\n!Open\n|a\n|\u0251\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consonants\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n|-\n!Stop\n|p\n|p\u02bc\n|t\n|t\u02bc\n|\n|\n|\n|k\n|k\u02bc\n|\u0294\n|-\n!Fricative\n|\u0278\n|\n|s\n|\n|\u0283\n|\n|\n|x\n|\n|\n|-\n!Affricate\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\n|t\u0361s\u02bc\n|t\u0361\u0283\n|t\u0361\u0283\u02bc\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Nasal\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Approximant\n|\n|\n|\u026b\u0325\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|w\n|\n|\n|-\n!Occluded lateral\n|\n|\n|k\u0361l\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nEven within single syllables the Nivacl\u00e9 consonant cluster /t\u0161/ (orthographic <tsh>, IPA cluster /t+\u0283/) contrasts with the alveopalatal affricate /\u010d/ (orthrographic <ch>, IPA /t\u0283/), and the cluster /t+s/ contrasts with the alveolar affricate /ts/, both across morpheme boundaries and within single morphemes \u2013 this is unusual cross-linguistically.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n=== Word order ===\nThe basic ''word order'' (constituent order) is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (Subject-Verb-Object), or, in the different formulation used by some, AVO (A = subject of transitive verb or \u2018agent\u2019, V = verb, O = object of transitive verb), though other orders are possible in less neutral contexts. It also has the basic orders GN (Genitive-Noun, that is, possessor-possessed), NA (Noun-Adjective), and NP-Rel (Head Noun-Relative Clause). It has few adpositions (prepositions or postpositions); rather these relational and locative functions are signaled by a rich set of suffixes and clitics attached primarily to verbs, but also to other parts of speech; it also has some relational nouns (possessed noun constructions that function as adpositions). The co-occurrence in a language of the orders SVO, NA, GN, and NP-Rel is somewhat unusual for a language with SVO basic word order typology, where NG (Noun + Genitive) would be the expected order, rather than Nivacl\u00e9\u2019s GN. SVO languages also tend to have Preposition-Noun order, too, though prepositions are mostly lacking in this language.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Nouns ===\nThe main grammatical categories (parts of speech, lexical categories) of Nivacl\u00e9 are noun, pronoun, demonstrative, adjective, adverb, and verb. There are significant syntactic and morphological differences in the behavior of several of these grammatical categories which distinguish them from similar categories in well-known European languages. Clitics are frequent in this language.\n\nThere is a masculine-feminine ''gender'' contrast in nouns, semantically determined for some nouns that refer to humans and certain animals, but otherwise arbitrary for most other nouns. However, the nouns themselves, in spite of their gender, generally bear no overt indication of gender assignment. This is signaled rather in the demonstratives which accompany the nouns and which agree with the gender of the noun. Also the plural markers that nouns bear differ depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine. There are several different ''plural'' markers, a complex system.\n\nThe ''demonstrative'' (deictic) system is also complex, with numerous demonstratives which are distinguished according to several semantic traits, sensitive to whether the referent is visible or not, was witnessed previously by the speaker, is known only from reports or hearsay, or no longer exists. As mentioned, these contrasting semantic traits of the demonstratives play a role in inferring the ''tense'' of an utterance. For example, if a referent is visible, then by inference it is present, in present time; if it was witnessed earlier but is not currently visible, then typically by inference it is past.\n\n''Evidentiality'' is also inferred from the semantic traits of the demonstratives. For example, if a speaker uses a \u2018visible\u2019 demonstrative, by inference this also indicates that he/she vouches for the truth value of the statement, for the reality of the entity modified by this demonstrative, because the speaker knows it from witnessing it. If, on the other hand, a demonstrative that indicates \u2018known only by report or hearsay\u2019 is employed, by inference this part of the utterance has the evidential sense that the speaker does not affirm the truth of what is said, but rather only reports it as something told by others and not known from personal experience. Evidentiality from demonstratives interacts with other discourse evidential markers, one word for things reported but not known and another for expressing doubt, uncertainty about the truth of an utterance. This carries over to multi-clause utterances, where subordinate clauses can contrast with regard to the conjunction that introduces them and in terms of the subject agreement markers they can take, where some are treated as real (events known to have happened or to be going to happen) and others are irrealis (things that have not happened but are hypothetical or doubtful).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Verbs ===\n''Verbs'' in this language are very complex and can bear many different affixes and clitics. Nevertheless, there are no direct grammatical markers on verbs nor elsewhere in the grammar for ''tense'' or ''aspect''. The senses of tense are conveyed by the demonstratives whose semantic contrasts give temporal inferences.

It is also known as Chulup\u00ed and Ashluslay, and in older sources has been called Ashlusl\u00e9, Suhin, Suj\u00edn, Chunup\u00ed, Churup\u00ed, Chorop\u00ed, and other variant spellings of these names. Nivacl\u00e9 speakers are found in the Chaco, in Paraguay in [[Presidente Hayes Department]], and [[Boquer\u00f3n Department]], and in Argentina in [[Salta Province]].\n\nNivacl\u00e9 is complex both in its phonology and morphology. Much of what is handled in syntactic constructions in many other languages is signalled in Nivacl\u00e9 by its rich bound morphology and clitics. Nivacl\u00e9 has several linguistic traits that are rare elsewhere in the world or even unique.\n\n== Phonology ==\nIts phonemic inventory has 21 ''consonants'' and 6 ''vowels'', including glottalized (ejective) stops and affricates, and a unique phoneme, /k\u0361l/.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|last2=Grondona|first2=Ver\u00f3nica|date=2012|title=Linguistic Acculturation in Nivacl\u00e9 and Chorote|jstor=10.1086/665672|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=78|issue=3|pages=335\u2013367|doi=10.1086/665672}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Vowels\n!\n!Front\n!Back\n|-\n!Close\n|i\n|u\n|-\n!Close-mid\n|e\n|o\n|-\n!Open\n|a\n|\u0251\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consonants\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n!{{Small|plain}}\n!{{Small|[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]}}\n|-\n!Stop\n|p\n|p\u02bc\n|t\n|t\u02bc\n|\n|\n|\n|k\n|k\u02bc\n|\u0294\n|-\n!Fricative\n|\u0278\n|\n|s\n|\n|\u0283\n|\n|\n|x\n|\n|\n|-\n!Affricate\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\n|t\u0361s\u02bc\n|t\u0361\u0283\n|t\u0361\u0283\u02bc\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Nasal\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Approximant\n|\n|\n|\u026b\u0325\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|w\n|\n|\n|-\n!Occluded lateral\n|\n|\n|k\u0361l\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nEven within single syllables the Nivacl\u00e9 consonant cluster /t\u0161/ (orthographic <tsh>, IPA cluster /t+\u0283/) contrasts with the alveopalatal affricate /\u010d/ (orthrographic <ch>, IPA /t\u0283/), and the cluster /t+s/ contrasts with the alveolar affricate /ts/, both across morpheme boundaries and within single morphemes \u2013 this is unusual cross-linguistically.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n=== Word order ===\nThe basic ''word order'' (constituent order) is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), or, in the different formulation used by some, AVO (A = subject of transitive verb or \u2018agent\u2019, V = verb, O = object of transitive verb), though other orders are possible in less neutral contexts. It also has the basic orders GN (Genitive-Noun, that is, possessor-possessed), NA (Noun-Adjective), and NP-Rel (Head Noun-Relative Clause). It has few adpositions (prepositions or postpositions); rather these relational and locative functions are signaled by a rich set of suffixes and clitics attached primarily to verbs, but also to other parts of speech; it also has some relational nouns (possessed noun constructions that function as adpositions). The co-occurrence in a language of the orders SVO, NA, GN, and NP-Rel is somewhat unusual for a language with SVO basic word order typology, where NG (Noun + Genitive) would be the expected order, rather than Nivacl\u00e9\u2019s GN. SVO languages also tend to have Preposition-Noun order, too, though prepositions are mostly lacking in this language.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Nouns ===\nThe main grammatical categories (parts of speech, lexical categories) of Nivacl\u00e9 are noun, pronoun, demonstrative, adjective, adverb, and verb. There are significant syntactic and morphological differences in the behavior of several of these grammatical categories which distinguish them from similar categories in well-known European languages. Clitics are frequent in this language.\n\nThere is a masculine-feminine ''gender'' contrast in nouns, semantically determined for some nouns that refer to humans and certain animals, but otherwise arbitrary for most other nouns. However, the nouns themselves, in spite of their gender, generally bear no overt indication of gender assignment. This is signaled rather in the demonstratives which accompany the nouns and which agree with the gender of the noun. Also the plural markers that nouns bear differ depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine. There are several different ''plural'' markers, a complex system.\n\nThe ''demonstrative'' (deictic) system is also complex, with numerous demonstratives which are distinguished according to several semantic traits, sensitive to whether the referent is visible or not, was witnessed previously by the speaker, is known only from reports or hearsay, or no longer exists. As mentioned, these contrasting semantic traits of the demonstratives play a role in inferring the ''tense'' of an utterance. For example, if a referent is visible, then by inference it is present, in present time; if it was witnessed earlier but is not currently visible, then typically by inference it is past.\n\n''Evidentiality'' is also inferred from the semantic traits of the demonstratives. For example, if a speaker uses a \u2018visible\u2019 demonstrative, by inference this also indicates that he/she vouches for the truth value of the statement, for the reality of the entity modified by this demonstrative, because the speaker knows it from witnessing it. If, on the other hand, a demonstrative that indicates \u2018known only by report or hearsay\u2019 is employed, by inference this part of the utterance has the evidential sense that the speaker does not affirm the truth of what is said, but rather only reports it as something told by others and not known from personal experience. Evidentiality from demonstratives interacts with other discourse evidential markers, one word for things reported but not known and another for expressing doubt, uncertainty about the truth of an utterance. This carries over to multi-clause utterances, where subordinate clauses can contrast with regard to the conjunction that introduces them and in terms of the subject agreement markers they can take, where some are treated as real (events known to have happened or to be going to happen) and others are irrealis (things that have not happened but are hypothetical or doubtful).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Verbs ===\n''Verbs'' in this language are very complex and can bear many different affixes and clitics. Nevertheless, there are no direct grammatical markers on verbs nor elsewhere in the grammar for ''tense'' or ''aspect''. The senses of tense are conveyed by the demonstratives whose semantic contrasts give temporal inferences. Nivacl\u00e9 is, thus, one of the few languages of the world which have ''nominal tense'' with no verbal tense marking.\n\nThe ''verb'' ''alignment'' is ''active-stative'' \u2013 there are two series of pronominal affixes on verbs, one that indicates subjects of active verbs which report events or happenings, whether they are transitive or intransitive, and another which signals both the object of transitive verbs and also the subject of stative intransitive verbs, verbs which refer to states and not to events or happenings, as the active verbs do. Indicative, negative, and irrealis verbs have distinct morphological markings of their own for personal pronoun subject agreement. There is also distinct morphology signaling verbs of subordinate clauses.\n\nNivacl\u00e9 distinguishes first person plural ''inclusive'' (\u2018we all\u2019, \u2018our [our (all)]\u2019) and ''exclusive'' (\u2018we\u2019 [I/we and other(s), but not including you], \u2018ours\u2019 [but not including yours]) in pronouns, in possessive morphology and in verbs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNivacl\u00e9 has a very rich system of ''directional'' affixes and clitics, marked primarily on the verbs, sometimes on other parts of speech. As mentioned, Nivacl\u00e9 generally lacks adpositions (prepositions and postpositions), as the directional affixes and clitics fulfill the roles played by adpositions in other languages. The language has a genitive noun classifier for possessed domestic animals and another for possessed prey (hunted animals).

It follows Kazuki Muto, who becomes an alchemical warrior in the battle against alchemical monsters known as [[homunculi]]. Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' manga, and then he tried to do as much as he could with that genre. It was serialized in publisher [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' (bound volumes). The series has been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for North American release.\n\nThe manga has been adapted into an [[anime]] television series, which was produced by studio [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]] and was broadcast on Japanese television network [[TV Tokyo]] from 2006 to 2007. In December 2007, the anime was announced for North American DVD release by [[Viz Media]]. In 2009, the series made its American television debut on the [[Funimation Channel]], with American broadcast rights acquired by [[Funimation]] from Viz Media. The series has also spawned two [[drama CD]]s, two [[light novel]]s, a [[PlayStation 2]] video game, and many types of ''Buso Renkin''-themed merchandise.\n\nIn Japan, the ''Buso Renkin'' manga has sold over 3 million volumes and was nominated for the science fiction works focused [[Seiun Award]]. It received a mixed reception from manga and anime publications. Watsuki's art received the most positive comments from reviewers, while other aspects of the manga, such as its action and characters, have divided critics' opinions. The anime, which critics described as a generic ''sh\u014dnen'' fighting series, received mostly negative reception.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Buso Renkin characters}}\nThe narrative of ''Buso Renkin'' follows Kazuki Muto, who saves Tokiko Tsumura and is killed by an alchemical monster known as a [[homunculus]]. Tokiko, an [[alchemy|alchemist]] warrior, feels responsible and revives him by replacing his destroyed heart with a {{nihongo4|kakugane|\u6838\u9244}}. The kakugane is an alchemical device which, when activated, takes a weapon form based on its user's personality, forming a buso renkin{{mdash}}the only thing that can destroy a homunculus. Kazuki creates his own buso renkin and joins Tokiko in the fight against the homunculi and their master, Koushaku Chouno.  Chouno, who has renamed himself \"Papillon\", is killed by Kazuki, but is later resurrected by the L.X.E., a humanoid homunculi group led by Chouno's great-great-grandfather Bakushaku Chouno, now calling himself Dr. Butterfly.  In various battles, Kazuki, Tokiko and Captain Bravo (their team leader) destroy most of the L.X.E.'s members. After learning that Dr. Butterfly believes him to be weak and useless, Papillon rebels against the L.X.E. and kills Dr. Butterfly.\n\nBefore his death, Dr. Butterfly drains the energy of the students at Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's\u2014a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the [[philosopher's stone]]. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.\n\nKazuki and Tokiko find the white kakugane, which can negate the effects of the black kakugane and is guarded by Victor's daughter Victoria, who is herself a humanoid homunculus.  During the Alchemist Army's final battle against Victor, Kazuki applies the white kakugane to Victor, but it only weakens him. To protect humankind from both of them, Kazuki propels himself and Victor to the moon. Later, Papillion creates a white kakugane to heal Kazuki. The Alchemist Army rescues Kazuki, creates another white kakugane and restores Victor's humanity. Reunited with his daughter, Victor asks the Alchemist Army to turn him into a homunculus and tells them that he and his daughter will lead all the homunculi to the moon. The Alchemist Army dedicates itself to research a way to revert homunculi back into humans, ending their war activities. All Warriors abdicate their kakugane. Kazuki and Tokiko return to their daily lives together while Papillon becomes an urban legend throughout Japan.\n\n== Production ==\n{{see also|List of Buso Renkin characters#Creation and conception}}\nNobuhiro Watsuki started writing ''Buso Renkin'' thinking it would be his last ''sh\u014dnen'' manga; he tried to do \"everything [he] ever wanted\" with that genre.

It follows Kazuki Muto, who becomes an alchemical warrior in the battle against alchemical monsters known as [[homunculi]]. Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' manga, and then he tried to do as much as he could with that genre. It was serialized in publisher [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' (bound volumes). The series has been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for North American release.\n\nThe manga has been adapted into an [[anime]] television series, which was produced by studio [[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]] and was broadcast on Japanese television network [[TV Tokyo]] from 2006 to 2007. In December 2007, the anime was announced for North American DVD release by [[Viz Media]]. In 2009, the series made its American television debut on the [[Funimation Channel]], with American broadcast rights acquired by [[Funimation]] from Viz Media. The series has also spawned two [[drama CD]]s, two [[light novel]]s, a [[PlayStation 2]] video game, and many types of ''Buso Renkin''-themed merchandise.\n\nIn Japan, the ''Buso Renkin'' manga has sold over 3 million volumes and was nominated for the science fiction works focused [[Seiun Award]]. It received a mixed reception from manga and anime publications. Watsuki's art received the most positive comments from reviewers, while other aspects of the manga, such as its action and characters, have divided critics' opinions. The anime, which critics described as a generic ''sh\u014dnen'' fighting series, received mostly negative reception.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Buso Renkin characters}}\nThe narrative of ''Buso Renkin'' follows Kazuki Muto, who saves Tokiko Tsumura and is killed by an alchemical monster known as a [[homunculus]]. Tokiko, an [[alchemy|alchemist]] warrior, feels responsible and revives him by replacing his destroyed heart with a {{nihongo4|kakugane|\u6838\u9244}}. The kakugane is an alchemical device which, when activated, takes a weapon form based on its user's personality, forming a buso renkin{{mdash}}the only thing that can destroy a homunculus. Kazuki creates his own buso renkin and joins Tokiko in the fight against the homunculi and their master, Koushaku Chouno.  Chouno, who has renamed himself \"Papillon\", is killed by Kazuki, but is later resurrected by the L.X.E., a humanoid homunculi group led by Chouno's great-great-grandfather Bakushaku Chouno, now calling himself Dr. Butterfly.  In various battles, Kazuki, Tokiko and Captain Bravo (their team leader) destroy most of the L.X.E.'s members. After learning that Dr. Butterfly believes him to be weak and useless, Papillon rebels against the L.X.E. and kills Dr. Butterfly.\n\nBefore his death, Dr. Butterfly drains the energy of the students at Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's\u2014a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the [[philosopher's stone]]. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.\n\nKazuki and Tokiko find the white kakugane, which can negate the effects of the black kakugane and is guarded by Victor's daughter Victoria, who is herself a humanoid homunculus.  During the Alchemist Army's final battle against Victor, Kazuki applies the white kakugane to Victor, but it only weakens him. To protect humankind from both of them, Kazuki propels himself and Victor to the moon. Later, Papillion creates a white kakugane to heal Kazuki. The Alchemist Army rescues Kazuki, creates another white kakugane and restores Victor's humanity. Reunited with his daughter, Victor asks the Alchemist Army to turn him into a homunculus and tells them that he and his daughter will lead all the homunculi to the moon. The Alchemist Army dedicates itself to research a way to revert homunculi back into humans, ending their war activities. All Warriors abdicate their kakugane. Kazuki and Tokiko return to their daily lives together while Papillon becomes an urban legend throughout Japan.\n\n== Production ==\n{{see also|List of Buso Renkin characters#Creation and conception}}\nNobuhiro Watsuki started writing ''Buso Renkin'' thinking it would be his last ''sh\u014dnen'' manga; he tried to do \"everything [he] ever wanted\" with that genre.

The following changes were added in the latter one: \"Ibn Jarir recorded that Sirin wanted Anas bin Malik to write a contract of emancipation and he delayed, then `Umar said to him, 'You should certainly write him a contract of emancipation.'\"<ref name=\"roo\"/>\n\n==Islamic Law==\n===Early Islam===\n\nAccording to [[Joseph Schacht]], those who were hearing [[Muhammad]] pronouncing this verse \"were supposed to know the details of the transaction referred to, and the strictest interpretation of the passage suggests that it was not identical with the contract of manumission by ''mukataba'' such as was elaborated later by the ancient lawyers in the second century of [[Islam]].\" The earliest interpretation of the verse suggested that the ''mukatab'' became free after paying one-half of the agreed amount. Another early decision attributed to the [[Mecca]]n scholar [[Ata ibn Rabi Rabah]] was that the slave acquired liberty having paid three-quarters. The doctrine of an early school of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] based in [[Kufa]] held that the ''mukatab'' became free as soon as he paid off his value; other contemporaneous opinions were that the ''mukatab'' became free ''pro rata'' with the payments or that he became free immediately after concluding the contract, the payments to his master being ordinary debts. Finally the view of the Kufan scholars prevailed, and according to Schacht, the [[hadith]] supporting this position were put into circulation; first they were projected to [[sahaba|Muhammad's companions]] and later to Muhammad himself.<ref>Schacht 42&ndash;43</ref>\n\n===Obligation upon master to grant the contract===\nThere is debate amongst scholars regarding the obligation upon the master to grant this contract. The [[\u1e92\u0101hir\u012b]] school of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] view it to be compulsory,<ref name=\"soo\"/><ref name=\"foo\"/>\nwhile the [[Shafa'i]]s, [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanafi]]s perceive it to be merely recommended,<ref name=\"foo\"/> and praise-worthy to do so.<ref name=\"gordon41\"/> [[Abul A'la Maududi]] says: A group of jurists have interpreted this as \u201cexecute the deed of emancipation with them\u201d, that it is obligatory for the owner to accept the offer of a slave to earn his emancipation. This is the view of Ata, Amr bin Dinar Ibn Sirin, Masruq, Dahhak, Ikrimah, the Zahiriyyah and Ibn Jarir Tabari, and Imam Shafai also favoured it in the beginning. The other group holds that it is not obligatory but only recommendatory and commendable. This group includes jurists like Shabi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Hasan Basri, Abdul Rahman bin Zaid, Sufyan Thauri, Abu Hanifah and Malik bin Anas and Imam Shafai later on also had adopted this view.<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nMaududi highlights the affirmation regarding the obligation by citing the Ahadith recounted by Abdur Razzaq and Bukhari in reference to a slave mentioned as Sirin, who owned some wealth, requesting emancipation from Musa bin Anas; who supposedly refused granting the contract. Umar, after being consulted by the slave, ordered that Musa was to be lashed, verbalizing the expression, \"Give them such a contract if ye find any good in them.\"<ref name=\"roo\">[http://www.recitequran.com/tafsir/en.ibn-kathir/24:33 Tafseer Ibn Kathir, 'The Command to Grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation']</ref>\nMaududi states that the argument against this proposes that only one incident was not sufficient enough to be declared as evidence for such a claim.<ref name=\"foo\"/> He retorts that, \"All that can be said is that Umar, apart from his position of a judge, was like a father to the Muslims and might have used his paternal authority in a matter where he could not intervene as a judge.<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nMaududi claims that the phrase, \"if ye know any good in them:\" renders this as upon the master to decide due to its subjectivity, and a lack of fix standard as to what qualifies as \"good.\"<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n[[Ashiq Ilahi]] cites Umar bin Dinar and Sayiddana Ali as being proponents for the first part of the verse,\"give them such a deed,\" as using imperative tone, hence making it compulsory.<ref name=\"qoo\"/> He states that [[Dur al-Manthur]] credited the hadith mentioned in Abu Dawud and Bayhaqi, which included Muhammad defining \"good\" as reference to one's skill and qualifications for labour and also hinting there being an implication of it simply forbidding the slave be compelled to beg.<ref name=\"qoo\"/> He claims that the hadith also mentions that Allah will aid the slave in paying his debt, henceforth the former must focus on earning halal income.<ref name=\"qoo\">Illuminating Discourses on the Noble Quran \u2013 Tafseer Anwarul Bayan \u2013 by Shaykh Ashiq Ilahi Madni, volume 3, page 590 \u2013 592 [https://discover-the-truth.com/2017/01/22/surah-2433-obligatory-to-enter-into-a-contract-to-free-a-slave/ Excerpt from 'Discover the Truth']</ref> Ibn Kathir summarizes this up like this: This is a command from Allah to slave-owners: if their servants ask them for a contract of emancipation, they should write for them, provided that the servant has some skill and means of earning so that he can pay his master the money that is stipulated in the contract.<ref name=\"roo\"/>\n\n===The Mukatib===\n\nThere are two different views of ''mukataba'' among scholars causing a divergence in the details: some call ''mukataba'' as a \"conditional enfranchisement\", while others see it as \"ransom by the slave of his own person\".

Another early decision attributed to the [[Mecca]]n scholar [[Ata ibn Rabi Rabah]] was that the slave acquired liberty having paid three-quarters. The doctrine of an early school of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] based in [[Kufa]] held that the ''mukatab'' became free as soon as he paid off his value; other contemporaneous opinions were that the ''mukatab'' became free ''pro rata'' with the payments or that he became free immediately after concluding the contract, the payments to his master being ordinary debts. Finally the view of the Kufan scholars prevailed, and according to Schacht, the [[hadith]] supporting this position were put into circulation; first they were projected to [[sahaba|Muhammad's companions]] and later to Muhammad himself.<ref>Schacht 42&ndash;43</ref>\n\n===Obligation upon master to grant the contract===\nThere is debate amongst scholars regarding the obligation upon the master to grant this contract. The [[\u1e92\u0101hir\u012b]] school of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] view it to be compulsory,<ref name=\"soo\"/><ref name=\"foo\"/>\nwhile the [[Shafa'i]]s, [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanafi]]s perceive it to be merely recommended,<ref name=\"foo\"/> and praise-worthy to do so.<ref name=\"gordon41\"/> [[Abul A'la Maududi]] says: A group of jurists have interpreted this as \u201cexecute the deed of emancipation with them\u201d, that it is obligatory for the owner to accept the offer of a slave to earn his emancipation. This is the view of Ata, Amr bin Dinar Ibn Sirin, Masruq, Dahhak, Ikrimah, the Zahiriyyah and Ibn Jarir Tabari, and Imam Shafai also favoured it in the beginning. The other group holds that it is not obligatory but only recommendatory and commendable. This group includes jurists like Shabi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Hasan Basri, Abdul Rahman bin Zaid, Sufyan Thauri, Abu Hanifah and Malik bin Anas and Imam Shafai later on also had adopted this view.<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nMaududi highlights the affirmation regarding the obligation by citing the Ahadith recounted by Abdur Razzaq and Bukhari in reference to a slave mentioned as Sirin, who owned some wealth, requesting emancipation from Musa bin Anas; who supposedly refused granting the contract. Umar, after being consulted by the slave, ordered that Musa was to be lashed, verbalizing the expression, \"Give them such a contract if ye find any good in them.\"<ref name=\"roo\">[http://www.recitequran.com/tafsir/en.ibn-kathir/24:33 Tafseer Ibn Kathir, 'The Command to Grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation']</ref>\nMaududi states that the argument against this proposes that only one incident was not sufficient enough to be declared as evidence for such a claim.<ref name=\"foo\"/> He retorts that, \"All that can be said is that Umar, apart from his position of a judge, was like a father to the Muslims and might have used his paternal authority in a matter where he could not intervene as a judge.<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nMaududi claims that the phrase, \"if ye know any good in them:\" renders this as upon the master to decide due to its subjectivity, and a lack of fix standard as to what qualifies as \"good.\"<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n[[Ashiq Ilahi]] cites Umar bin Dinar and Sayiddana Ali as being proponents for the first part of the verse,\"give them such a deed,\" as using imperative tone, hence making it compulsory.<ref name=\"qoo\"/> He states that [[Dur al-Manthur]] credited the hadith mentioned in Abu Dawud and Bayhaqi, which included Muhammad defining \"good\" as reference to one's skill and qualifications for labour and also hinting there being an implication of it simply forbidding the slave be compelled to beg.<ref name=\"qoo\"/> He claims that the hadith also mentions that Allah will aid the slave in paying his debt, henceforth the former must focus on earning halal income.<ref name=\"qoo\">Illuminating Discourses on the Noble Quran \u2013 Tafseer Anwarul Bayan \u2013 by Shaykh Ashiq Ilahi Madni, volume 3, page 590 \u2013 592 [https://discover-the-truth.com/2017/01/22/surah-2433-obligatory-to-enter-into-a-contract-to-free-a-slave/ Excerpt from 'Discover the Truth']</ref> Ibn Kathir summarizes this up like this: This is a command from Allah to slave-owners: if their servants ask them for a contract of emancipation, they should write for them, provided that the servant has some skill and means of earning so that he can pay his master the money that is stipulated in the contract.<ref name=\"roo\"/>\n\n===The Mukatib===\n\nThere are two different views of ''mukataba'' among scholars causing a divergence in the details: some call ''mukataba'' as a \"conditional enfranchisement\", while others see it as \"ransom by the slave of his own person\". Jurists usually disapprove of entering a ''mukataba'' with a female slave with no honest source of income.<ref name=\"Abd\"/> The majority of Sunni authorities approved the manumission of all the \"[[People of the Book]]\", that is, Christians and Jews, but according to some jurists, especially among the [[Shi\u2019a]], only Muslim slaves should be liberated.<ref>Lewis(1990) 106</ref>\n\nAccording to the opinion of a majority of Muslim jurists, the slave must pay the agreed-upon amount in instalments.

After that, Kraft Foods licensed the Pop Rocks brand  to [[Zeta Espacial]] S.A. who continued manufacturing the product under Kraft's license. Eventually Zeta Espacial S.A. became the brand's owner and sole manufacturer. Pop Rocks is distributed in the U.S. by Pop Rocks Inc. (Atlanta, Georgia) and by Zeta Espacial S.A.

Zeta Espacial S.A. also sells popping candy internationally under other brands including Peta Zetas, Wiz Fizz, and Magic Gum.\n\nIn 2008, Marv, who led the group assigned to bring Pop Rocks out of the laboratory and into the manufacturing plant, wrote a history of Pop Rocks development.  The book, titled ''Pop Rocks: The Inside Story of America's Revolutionary Candy'', was based on interviews with food technologists, engineers, marketing managers, and members of Billy Mitchell's family, along with the author's experience.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.<ref>G.M.Rinaldi, \"Il Codice Pray\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html</ref>  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.\n\nThe first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> and the first certain record (in [[Lirey]], [[France]]) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.<ref name=\"Poulle 2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

The comparison between different tests demonstrated that the blood patterns on the forearms and on the back of the hand are not connected, and would have had to occur at different times, as a result of a very specific sequence of movements. In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. However, medical studies of the image speculate that the man's right [[humerus]] may have been dislocated, which could potentially account for the right arm lowering.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307773215_Medical_News_From_Scientific_Analysis_of_the_Turin_Shroud Medical News From Scientific Analysis of the Turin Shroud]</ref> No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body.

He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, Joe Nickell noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin. Corona discharges and/or plasmas made no contribution to image formation.\"<ref name=Rogers2008>{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Raymond N. |title=A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin |date=2008 |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press, Inc.]] |isbn=978-0615239286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-n84sc4ayYC&pg=PA83}}</ref>{{rp|83}}\n\nIn December 2011, Fanti published a critical compendium of the major hypotheses regarding the formation of the body image on the shroud.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

Some claim the image depicts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and the fabric is the [[burial shroud]] in which he was wrapped after crucifixion.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches.

Among the most prominent portable early ''acheiropoieta'' are the [[Image of Camuliana]] and the [[Mandylion]] or Image of [[Edessa]], both painted icons of Christ held in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the [[Hodegetria]] image of the Virgin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitzinger |first1=Ernst |title=The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=1954 |volume=8 |pages=83\u2013150 |doi=10.2307/1291064 |jstor=1291064}}</ref> Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as ''acheiropoieta'' now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud.\n\nProponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]].<ref>Charles S.

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. However, medical studies of the image speculate that the man's right [[humerus]] may have been dislocated, which could potentially account for the right arm lowering.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307773215_Medical_News_From_Scientific_Analysis_of_the_Turin_Shroud Medical News From Scientific Analysis of the Turin Shroud]</ref> No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, Joe Nickell noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of starch fractions, various sugars, and other impurities. In a paper entitled \"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction may explain the image formation,\"<ref>Rogers, R.N. and Arnoldi, A.: \"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction (Maillard reaction) may explain the image formation\", ''Melanoidins in Food and Health'', Volume 4, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp. 106\u2013113, {{ISBN|92-894-5724-4}}</ref> [[Raymond N. Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid decomposition products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud.
