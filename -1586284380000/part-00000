{"title_page": "Media preservation", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n\n[[Preservation (library and archival science)|Preservation]] of documents, pictures, recordings, digital content, etc., is a major aspect of [[archival science]]. It is also an important consideration for people who are creating [[time capsule]]s, [[family history]], [[historical document]]s, [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]] and [[family tree]]s. Common storage media are not permanent, and there are few reliable methods of preserving documents and pictures for the future.\n\n==Paper/prints (photos)==\n{{Main|Photograph preservation}}\n\nColor [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and ordinary color [[Photographic printing|prints]] may fade away to nothing in a relatively short period if not stored and handled properly. This happens even if the negatives and prints are kept in the dark, because ambient light is not the determining factor, but heat and humidity are. The color degradation is the result of the dyes used in the color processes. Because [[Color photography|color processing]] results in a less stable image than traditional [[black-and-white]] processing, black-and-white pictures from the 1920s are more likely to survive long-term than color films and photographs from after the middle 20th century.\n\nBlack-and-white photographic films using [[silver halide]] emulsions are the only film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films were coated onto a nitrate base material which was prone to combustion if stored in uncontrolled temperatures. [[Nitrate film]] was replaced with acetate-base films. These [[Cellulose acetate film]]s were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome).

Binder hydrolysis, also known as [[sticky-shed syndrome]], refers to the breakdown of binder, or glue, that holds the magnetic particles to the polyester base of the tape.

It is also an important consideration for people who are creating [[time capsule]]s, [[family history]], [[historical document]]s, [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]] and [[family tree]]s. Common storage media are not permanent, and there are few reliable methods of preserving documents and pictures for the future.\n\n==Paper/prints (photos)==\n{{Main|Photograph preservation}}\n\nColor [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and ordinary color [[Photographic printing|prints]] may fade away to nothing in a relatively short period if not stored and handled properly. This happens even if the negatives and prints are kept in the dark, because ambient light is not the determining factor, but heat and humidity are. The color degradation is the result of the dyes used in the color processes. Because [[Color photography|color processing]] results in a less stable image than traditional [[black-and-white]] processing, black-and-white pictures from the 1920s are more likely to survive long-term than color films and photographs from after the middle 20th century.\n\nBlack-and-white photographic films using [[silver halide]] emulsions are the only film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films were coated onto a nitrate base material which was prone to combustion if stored in uncontrolled temperatures. [[Nitrate film]] was replaced with acetate-base films. These [[Cellulose acetate film]]s were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome). Acetate films were replaced in the early 1980s by [[polyester]] film base materials which have been determined to be more stable than nitrate- and acetate-base films.\n\nColor prints made on most [[inkjet printer]]s look very good at first but they have a very short lifespan, measured in months rather than in years.

The school was founded in 1992 by Amanda Franklin and her husband, Stephen Franklin, a pastor in a local church. The school takes both male and female pupils from ages 3 to 19, in a {{as of|2008|05|alt=current}} roll of 46.\n\n== History ==\nThe original site for the school was in the Franklin's home, Locksley Hall, [[North Somercotes]], Lincolnshire. The school moved to new premises in [[Manby|Manby Park]], Lincolnshire in 1995.<ref>[http://www.regentsacademy.org.uk/history.html Regents Academy l<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Manby Park is a business park on the site of [[RAF Manby|a former RAF base]]. In November 2004 the school expanded, opening a dedicated IT centre in Bowen house, a building next door to the main school. The School recently changed name from Locksley Christian School.\n\n== Education ==\nRegents Academy uses the [[Accelerated Christian Education]] curriculum rather than the UK's [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|national curriculum]]. The qualification gained through this system is the 'International Certificate of Christian Education' which has been designated by the ICCE Board as equivalent to A-level, AS-level, [[GCSE]] higher tier and [[GCSE]] foundation.<ref>[http://icce-global.org/ International Certificate of Christian Education <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The school offers GCSEs in some circumstances. The curriculum uses individual workbooks (called PACEs) for each unit of work.<ref>[http://www.regentsacademy.org.uk/accelerated-christian-education.html Regents Academy - Curriculum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the end of each unit the pupil takes a test on which they must achieve a score of 80% or higher in order to advance to the next unit.\n\nThe school is separated into two learning centres based on pupil age and ability. Each learning centre has a supervisor, who provides academic assistance and motivation for pupils, and a monitor who performs administration tasks.<ref>[http://www.regentsacademy.org.uk/learning-centres.html Regents Academy - Learning Centers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A core curriculum includes mathematics, English, social studies, science and word building (etymology), provided through the ACE curriculum. Expanded curriculum lessons provide group-based activities in subject areas such as ICT, practical science, creative English, literature, history, art, music, devotions, drama, dance, and physical education.<ref>[http://www.regentsacademy.org.uk/expanded-curriculum.html Regents Academy - Expanded Curriculum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nRegents is affiliated with [[Christian Education Europe]]<ref>[http://www.christian-education.org/schools/choosing-a-school/uk-schools/ Christian Education Europe - Schools<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the central body for schools using the ACE curriculum in Europe,<ref>[http://www.christian-education.org/ Christian Education Europe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and has achieved CEE model school status since July 2006. Older pupils compete in the European Student Convention, a yearly event organised by CEE and which features events in categories including academics, art, drama, music and sport.<ref>[http://www.regentsacademy.org.uk/european-student-convention.html European Student Convention<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nRegents provides education for those with [[special educational needs]]; a large minority of its pupils have Special Educational Needs statements.\n\nThe school has a sports field and a playground. Indoor sporting facilities are provided by a nearby gym hired by the school.\n\n== Houses ==\nPupils are split into four houses named after significant scientists: [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] (yellow), [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] (blue), [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (green), and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] (red).
