{"title_page": "John Muckle", "text_new": "'''John Muckle''' (born 9 December 1954) is a British writer who has published fiction, poetry and [[literary criticism]]. \n\nBorn in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]], he grew up in the village of [[Cobham, Surrey]]. After qualifying as a teacher and working in London FE colleges, he moved into book publishing, first for literary publisher [[Marion Boyars]], moving on to Grafton Books (later subsumed into HarperCollins) as a paperback copywriter. In the mid-1980s he initiated the [[Paladin Poetry Series]]. Muckle was general editor of its flagship anthology ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' (Paladin, 1988), commissioning a number of other titles before he left. The poetry imprint was edited subsequently by writer [[Iain Sinclair]]. Muckle worked as a freelance copywriter for [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] before returning to teaching, for five years at Essex University, later in various other jobs. \n\n''The Cresta Run'', Muckle's first book, was reviewed enthusiastically by [[Norman Shrapnel]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"An identifiable vernacular for this still measurable sector of the populace - working-class if not always working - is amply available and John Muckle's excellent stories prove it. The territory of ''The Cresta Run'' is short on dropouts and introverts; it's more a world of sleazy service stations, hot-dog vans and skinheads along the Hog's Back, dangerous sailors hot from the Falklands, people you watch your words with.\" \n\nIn 1989 he received a Hawthornden Writers' Fellowship. Writing of ''Cyclomotors'', [[John Berger]] said: \"It's a wonderful book - marvellously constructed and of a fidelity to experience such as you only come across with a true storyteller - as distinct from word-spinner.\" This hard-to-classify fiction was \npraised by a number of prominent writers.

Pharaoh finds them by the sea shore and attempts to drive them into the ocean with his chariots and drown them.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 5 through 15</ref>\n\nYahweh [[Crossing the Red Sea|causes the Red Sea to part]] and the Hebrews pass through on dry land into the Sinai. After the Israelites escape from the midst of the sea, Yahweh causes the ocean to close back in on the pursuing Egyptian army, drowning them to death. In the [[Sinai Desert|desert]] Yahweh feeds them with [[manna]] that accumulates on the ground with the morning dew. They are led by a [[Pillar of Cloud|column of cloud]], which ignites at night and becomes a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] to illuminate the way, southward through the desert until they come to Mount Sinai. The twelve tribes of Israel encamp around the mountain, and on the third day Mount Sinai begins to smolder, then catches fire, and Yahweh speaks the [[Ten Commandments]] from the midst of the fire to all the Israelites, from the top of the mountain.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 15, 19, and 20</ref>\n\nMoses ascends [[biblical Mount Sinai]] and fasts for forty days while he writes down the [[Torah]] as Yahweh dictates, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Bereshith]] and the creation of the universe and earth.<ref>Bereshith; Genesis 1</ref><ref>The Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth by [[Gerald Schroeder|Gerald L. Schroeder]] PhD (May 9, 2002)</ref> He is shown the design of the [[Mishkan]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which [[Bezalel]] is given the task of building. Moses descends from the mountain forty days later with the [[Sefer Torah]] he wrote, and with two rectangular [[lapis lazuli]]<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 24</ref> tablets, into which Yahweh had carved the Ten Commandments in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo\u2013Hebrew]]. In his absence, [[Aaron]] has constructed an image of Yahweh,<ref>Tehillim; Psalms 106, 19\u201320</ref> depicting him as a young [[golden calf]], and has presented it to the Israelites, declaring \"Behold O Israel, this is your god who brought you out of the land of Egypt\". Moses smashes the two tablets and grinds the golden calf into dust, then throws the dust into a stream of water flowing out of Mount Sinai, and forces the Israelites to drink from it.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 21 through 32</ref>\n\n[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the twelve tribes of Israel (before the move of Dan to the north), based on the [[Book of Joshua#Division of the land .28chapters 13.E2.80.9321.29|Book of Joshua]]]]\nMoses ascends Mount Sinai for a second time and Yahweh [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|passes before]] him and says: 'Yahweh, Yahweh, a god of compassion, and showing favor, slow to anger, and great in kindness and in truth, who shows kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving wrongdoing and injustice and wickedness, but will by no means clear the guilty, causing the consequences of the parent's wrongdoing to befall their children, and their children's children, to the third and fourth generation'<ref>Shemoth; Exodus, 34, 6\u20137</ref> Moses then fasts for another forty days while Yahweh carves the Ten Commandments into a second set of stone tablets. After the tablets are completed, light emanates from the face of Moses for the rest of his life, causing him to wear a veil so he does not frighten people.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 34</ref>\n\nMoses descends Mount Sinai and the Israelites agree to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people of Yahweh]] and [[Shomer Shabbat|follow all the laws of the Torah]]. Moses prophesies if they forsake the Torah, Yahweh will [[Babylonian exile|exile]] them for the total number of years they did not observe the [[shmita]].<ref>Wayiqra; Leviticus 26</ref> Bezael constructs the Ark of the Covenant and the Mishkan, where the presence of Yahweh dwells on earth in the [[Holy of Holies]], above the Ark of the Covenant, which houses the Ten Commandments. Moses sends spies to scout out the [[Land of Canaan]], and the Israelites are commanded to go up and conquer the land, but they refuse, due to their fear of warfare and violence. In response, Yahweh condemns the entire generation, including Moses, who is condemned for [[Meribah|striking the rock]] at Meribah, to exile and death in the Sinai desert.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 35 through 40, Wayiqra; Leviticus, Bamidhbar; Numbers, Devariam; Deuteronomy</ref>\n\nBefore Moses dies he gives a speech to the Israelites where he paraphrases [[Deuteronomy|a summary]] of the [[mizwa|mizwoth]] given to them by Yahweh, and recites a prophetic song called the [[Ha'azinu]]. Moses prophesies that if the Israelites disobey the Torah, Yahweh will cause a global [[Bar Kochba Revolt#Immediate consequences and exile|exile]] in addition to the minor one prophesied earlier at Mount Sinai, but at the end of days Yahweh will [[Gathering of Israel|gather them back to Israel from among the nations]] when they turn back to the Torah with zeal.<ref>Devariam; Deuteronomy 28 and 29 and 30</ref> The events of the Israelite exodus and their sojourn in the Sinai are memorialized in the Jewish and Samaritan festivals of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkoth]], and the giving of the Torah in the Jewish celebration of [[Shavuoth]].<ref name=\"wylen\"/><ref>Devariam; Deuteronomy</ref>\n\nForty years after [[the Exodus]], following the death of the generation of Moses, a new generation, led by [[Joshua]], enters Canaan and takes possession of the land in accordance with the promise made to Abraham by Yahweh. Land is allocated to the tribes by [[Land Lottery|lottery]]. Eventually the Israelites ask for a king, and Yahweh gives them [[Saul]]. [[David]], the youngest (divinely favored) son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]] would succeed [[Saul]]. Under David the Israelites establish the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]], and under David's son [[Solomon]] they construct the [[Holy Temple in Jerusalem]], using the 400-year-old materials of the Mishkan, where Yahweh continues to tabernacle himself among them. On the death of Solomon and reign of his son, [[Rehoboam]], the kingdom is divided in two.<ref>Yehoshua; Joshua, Shoftim; Judges, Shmuel; Samuel, Melakhim; Kings</ref>\n\nThe kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Samaria]] are uniformly bad, permitting the worship of other gods and failing to enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, and so Yahweh eventually allows them to be conquered and dispersed among the peoples of the earth; and strangers rule over their remnant in the northern land. In [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] some kings are good and enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, but many are bad and permit other gods, even in the Holy Temple itself, and at length Yahweh allows Judah to fall to her enemies, the people taken into captivity in [[Babylon]], the land left empty and desolate, and the Holy Temple itself destroyed.<ref name=\"wylen\"/><ref>Melakhim; Kings, Divrei HaYamim; Chronicles</ref>\n\nYet despite these events Yahweh does not forget his people, but sends [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus, king of Persia]] to deliver them from bondage. The Israelites are allowed to return to Judah and Benjamin, the Holy Temple is rebuilt, the priestly orders restored, and the service of sacrifice resumed. Through the offices of the sage [[Ezra]], Israel is constituted as a holy nation, bound by the Torah and holding itself apart from all other peoples.<ref name=\"wylen\"/><ref>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\n\nIn 2000, M. Hammer, et al. conducted a study on 1371 men and definitively established that part of the paternal gene pool of Jewish communities in Europe, North Africa and Middle East came from a common Middle East ancestral population.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hammer | first1 = MF | last2 = Redd | first2 = AJ | last3 = Wood | first3 = ET | display-authors = etal | year = 2000 | title = Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 12| pages = 6769\u20136774 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.100115997 | pmid = 10801975 | pmc = 18733 }}</ref>\nAnother study (Nebel et al. 2001) noted; \"In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab neighbors. The authors found that, \"Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin differed from the other Middle Eastern populations studied, mainly in specific high-frequency Eu 10 haplotypes not found in the non-Arab groups.\" and suggested that some of this difference might be due to migration and admixture from the Arabian peninsula during the last two millennia.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nebel | first1 = Almut | last2 = Filon | first2 = Dvora | last3 = Brinkmann | first3 = Bernd | last4 = Majumder | first4 = Partha P. | last5 = Faerman | first5 = Marina | last6 = Oppenheim | first6 = Ariella | year = 2001 | title = The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East | journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 69 | issue = 5| pages = 1095\u2013112 | doi = 10.1086/324070 | pmid = 11573163 | pmc = 1274378 }}</ref>\nA 2004 study (by Shen et al.) comparing Samaritans to several Jewish populations (including [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Iraqi Jews]], [[Libyan Jews]], [[Moroccan Jews]], and [[Yemenite Jews]], as well as Israeli [[Druze]] and [[Palestinians]]) found that \"the principal components analysis suggested a common ancestry of Samaritan and Jewish patrilineages.

The outgrowth of Yahweh-centric monolatrism from Canaanite [[polytheism]] started with [[Yahwism]], the belief in the existence of the many gods and goddesses of the [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite pantheon]] but with the consistent worship of only Yahweh. Along with a number of [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic practices]], this gave rise to a separate Israelite [[ethnic group]] identity.

The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period.\" (pp. 6\u20137).

Although related, the terms [[Hebrews]], Israelites, and [[Jews]] are not interchangeable in all instances. \"Israelites\" (''Yisraelim'') refers to the people that the Hebrew Bible describes specifically as the direct descendants of any of the sons of the patriarch [[Jacob#Jewish tradition|Jacob]] (later called Israel), and his descendants as a people are also collectively called \"Israel\", including converts to their faith in worship of the [[God in Judaism|god of Israel]], [[Yahweh]]. \"Hebrews\" (''\u02bfIvrim''), on the contrary, is used to denote the Israelites' immediate forebears who dwelt in the [[land of Canaan]], the Israelites themselves, and the Israelites' ancient and modern descendants (including Jews and [[Samaritans]]). \"Jews\" (''Yehudim'') is used to denote the descendants of the Israelites who coalesced when the [[Tribe of Judah]] absorbed the remnants of various other Israelite tribes. \n\nDuring the period of the divided monarchy \"Israelites\" was only used to refer to the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], and it is only extended to cover the people of the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] in post-exilic usage.<ref>Robert L.Cate, \"Israelite\", in Watson E.

In the [[Sinai Desert|desert]] Yahweh feeds them with [[manna]] that accumulates on the ground with the morning dew. They are led by a [[Pillar of Cloud|column of cloud]], which ignites at night and becomes a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] to illuminate the way, southward through the desert until they come to Mount Sinai. The twelve tribes of Israel encamp around the mountain, and on the third day Mount Sinai begins to smolder, then catches fire, and Yahweh speaks the [[Ten Commandments]] from the midst of the fire to all the Israelites, from the top of the mountain.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 15, 19, and 20</ref>\n\nMoses ascends [[biblical Mount Sinai]] and fasts for forty days while he writes down the [[Torah]] as Yahweh dictates, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Bereshith]] and the creation of the universe and earth.<ref>Bereshith; Genesis 1</ref><ref>The Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth by [[Gerald Schroeder|Gerald L. Schroeder]] PhD (May 9, 2002)</ref> He is shown the design of the [[Mishkan]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which [[Bezalel]] is given the task of building. Moses descends from the mountain forty days later with the [[Sefer Torah]] he wrote, and with two rectangular [[lapis lazuli]]<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 24</ref> tablets, into which Yahweh had carved the Ten Commandments in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo\u2013Hebrew]]. In his absence, [[Aaron]] has constructed an image of Yahweh,<ref>Tehillim; Psalms 106, 19\u201320</ref> depicting him as a young [[golden calf]], and has presented it to the Israelites, declaring \"Behold O Israel, this is your god who brought you out of the land of Egypt\". Moses smashes the two tablets and grinds the golden calf into dust, then throws the dust into a stream of water flowing out of Mount Sinai, and forces the Israelites to drink from it.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 21 through 32</ref>\n\n[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the twelve tribes of Israel (before the move of Dan to the north), based on the [[Book of Joshua#Division of the land .28chapters 13.E2.80.9321.29|Book of Joshua]]]]\nMoses ascends Mount Sinai for a second time and Yahweh [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|passes before]] him and says: 'Yahweh, Yahweh, a god of compassion, and showing favor, slow to anger, and great in kindness and in truth, who shows kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving wrongdoing and injustice and wickedness, but will by no means clear the guilty, causing the consequences of the parent's wrongdoing to befall their children, and their children's children, to the third and fourth generation'<ref>Shemoth; Exodus, 34, 6\u20137</ref> Moses then fasts for another forty days while Yahweh carves the Ten Commandments into a second set of stone tablets. After the tablets are completed, light emanates from the face of Moses for the rest of his life, causing him to wear a veil so he does not frighten people.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 34</ref>\n\nMoses descends Mount Sinai and the Israelites agree to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people of Yahweh]] and [[Shomer Shabbat|follow all the laws of the Torah]]. Moses prophesies if they forsake the Torah, Yahweh will [[Babylonian exile|exile]] them for the total number of years they did not observe the [[shmita]].<ref>Wayiqra; Leviticus 26</ref> Bezael constructs the Ark of the Covenant and the Mishkan, where the presence of Yahweh dwells on earth in the [[Holy of Holies]], above the Ark of the Covenant, which houses the Ten Commandments. Moses sends spies to scout out the [[Land of Canaan]], and the Israelites are commanded to go up and conquer the land, but they refuse, due to their fear of warfare and violence. In response, Yahweh condemns the entire generation, including Moses, who is condemned for [[Meribah|striking the rock]] at Meribah, to exile and death in the Sinai desert.<ref>Shemoth; Exodus 35 through 40, Wayiqra; Leviticus, Bamidhbar; Numbers, Devariam; Deuteronomy</ref>\n\nBefore Moses dies he gives a speech to the Israelites where he paraphrases [[Deuteronomy|a summary]] of the [[mizwa|mizwoth]] given to them by Yahweh, and recites a prophetic song called the [[Ha'azinu]]. Moses prophesies that if the Israelites disobey the Torah, Yahweh will cause a global [[Bar Kochba Revolt#Immediate consequences and exile|exile]] in addition to the minor one prophesied earlier at Mount Sinai, but at the end of days Yahweh will [[Gathering of Israel|gather them back to Israel from among the nations]] when they turn back to the Torah with zeal.<ref>Devariam; Deuteronomy 28 and 29 and 30</ref> The events of the Israelite exodus and their sojourn in the Sinai are memorialized in the Jewish and Samaritan festivals of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkoth]], and the giving of the Torah in the Jewish celebration of [[Shavuoth]].<ref name=\"wylen\"/><ref>Devariam; Deuteronomy</ref>\n\nForty years after [[the Exodus]], following the death of the generation of Moses, a new generation, led by [[Joshua]], enters Canaan and takes possession of the land in accordance with the promise made to Abraham by Yahweh. Land is allocated to the tribes by [[Land Lottery|lottery]]. Eventually the Israelites ask for a king, and Yahweh gives them [[Saul]]. [[David]], the youngest (divinely favored) son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]] would succeed [[Saul]]. Under David the Israelites establish the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]], and under David's son [[Solomon]] they construct the [[Holy Temple in Jerusalem]], using the 400-year-old materials of the Mishkan, where Yahweh continues to tabernacle himself among them. On the death of Solomon and reign of his son, [[Rehoboam]], the kingdom is divided in two.<ref>Yehoshua; Joshua, Shoftim; Judges, Shmuel; Samuel, Melakhim; Kings</ref>\n\nThe kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Samaria]] are uniformly bad, permitting the worship of other gods and failing to enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, and so Yahweh eventually allows them to be conquered and dispersed among the peoples of the earth; and strangers rule over their remnant in the northern land. In [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] some kings are good and enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, but many are bad and permit other gods, even in the Holy Temple itself, and at length Yahweh allows Judah to fall to her enemies, the people taken into captivity in [[Babylon]], the land left empty and desolate, and the Holy Temple itself destroyed.<ref name=\"wylen\"/><ref>Melakhim; Kings, Divrei HaYamim; Chronicles</ref>\n\nYet despite these events Yahweh does not forget his people, but sends [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus, king of Persia]] to deliver them from bondage. The Israelites are allowed to return to Judah and Benjamin, the Holy Temple is rebuilt, the priestly orders restored, and the service of sacrifice resumed. Through the offices of the sage [[Ezra]], Israel is constituted as a holy nation, bound by the Torah and holding itself apart from all other peoples.<ref name=\"wylen\"/><ref>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\n\nIn 2000, M.

The authors found that, \"Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin differed from the other Middle Eastern populations studied, mainly in specific high-frequency Eu 10 haplotypes not found in the non-Arab groups.\" and suggested that some of this difference might be due to migration and admixture from the Arabian peninsula during the last two millennia.<ref>Nebel, Almut; Filon, Dvora; Brinkmann, Bernd; Majumder, Partha P.; Faerman, Marina; Oppenheim, Ariella (November 2001). \"The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East\".

Due to server and web hosting costs, the founders created \"Sponsorships\" which is now known as \"FIRST\", a subscription to exclusive and earlier access to content and discounts on their merchandise store, among other benefits. The company later branched out into [[live-action]] shorts, series, comedy, [[Let's Play]] videos, and full animated productions. Other projects include reality shows, video game development, entertainment news programs, and [[podcasts]]. In 2015, Rooster Teeth released its feature-film debut ''[[Lazer Team]]'', a [[science-fiction]] [[action comedy]]. The company hosts an annual convention, [[RTX (event)|RTX]], in several cities around the world.\n\nThe company's videos are regularly released on its own website and app while podcasts and Let's Plays are still released on their [[YouTube]] channel as well.

The series' most popular episode remains [[Goku]] vs [[Superman]], and attracted controversy after calculating that Superman would win the heavily contested debate. Other content includes an animated fight show without research called ''DBX'', a podcast called ''Death Battle Cast'', and an informative show called ''Desk of Death Battle''.\n\nOn February 4, 2019 the ScrewAttack [[YouTube]] channel was re-branded to Death Battle to better match the channel's main content.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://roosterteeth.com/episode/death-battle-cast-2019-good-bye-screwattack |title=We say Goodbye to ScrewAttack - DEATH BATTLE Cast - S4E113 |publisher=Rooster Teeth |access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref> The ScrewAttack section of the Rooster Teeth website was turned into an archive for the channel's old content.\n\nThere are three main characters in the ''Death Battle'' series. Wizard is the rational host for ''Death Battle''. He is a cyborg and scientific genius who provides logical proofs for character attributes. Wiz typically portrays a calm demeanor throughout the series, though becomes upset when his research goes unnoticed. Boomstick, the excitable host for ''Death Battle'', is a fatherless countryman who likes three things: weapons, alcohol, and puns. He provides most of the comic relief in the series. Jocelyn the ''Death Battle'' intern at Rooster Teeth states that she does all the research no one else wants to do for the series. That holds some truth because she demonstrates profound knowledge about battle contestants. Her office, unfortunately, is a closet. Minor characters include Nervous Nick, who performs ''Top 10'' lists for Rooster Teeth.\n\n=== Game Kids ===\n'''Game Kids''' was a division of Rooster Teeth Productions aimed at creating kid and family friendly content. The channel launched on December 1, 2014 and featured the series \"Sim Sisters\" featuring Millie Ramsey, the daughter of Geoff Ramsey, and her nanny Chelsea playing Sims together, \"Kids Play\" featuring Matt Hullum and his children Webb and Mills or Burnie Burns and his children JD and Teddy, appearing on alternating weeks playing various games, and \"Bro Gaming\" featuring Rooster Teeth employee Caleb Denecour and his younger brother Jordan playing various cooperative games including an ongoing series in ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes|Disney Infinity 2.0]]''.

This meant that the branch would provide merchandise, promotion, and other benefits for its partners. On March 28, 2016, a partnership with [[Kinda Funny]] was announced. It was founded by Rooster Teeth co-founder Geoff Ramsey and is run by Luis Medina with Ramsey.

Due to server and web hosting costs, the founders created \"Sponsorships\" which is now known as \"FIRST\", a subscription to exclusive and earlier access to content and discounts on their merchandise store, among other benefits. The company later branched out into [[live-action]] shorts, series, comedy, [[Let's Play]] videos, and full animated productions. Other projects include reality shows, video game development, entertainment news programs, and [[podcasts]]. In 2015, Rooster Teeth released its feature-film debut ''[[Lazer Team]]'', a [[science-fiction]] [[action comedy]]. The company hosts an annual convention, [[RTX (event)|RTX]], in several cities around the world.\n\nThe company's videos are regularly released on its own website and app while podcasts and Let's Plays are still released on their [[YouTube]] channel as well. As of March 2019, Rooster Teeth's primary YouTube channel has 9.6 million subscribers and has over 5.8 billion video views.<ref name=\"RoosterTeeTH - YouTube\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/RoosterTeeth/about |title=RoosterTeeth -YouTube |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527095039/https://www.youtube.com/user/RoosterTeeth/about |archive-date=May 27, 2015 |access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref> Including all of their other channels, they maintain over 45 million subscribers.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Company history ==\n[[File:Rooster Teeth Congress office (2548207067).jpg|thumb|right|Rooster Teeth's office on Congress Street in Austin in 2008]]\nWhile attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum collaborated with actor Joel Heyman on a 1997 [[independent film]] called ''The Schedule''.<ref>Moltenbrey, Gross.</ref> The film helped Hullum and Heyman to find work in Los Angeles, but otherwise had limited success.<ref name=\"Moltenbrey\">Moltenbrey</ref> Working for a local company named Telenetwork, Burns later met [[Geoff Ramsey]] (then named Geoff Fink), [[Gustavo Sorola]], Dan Godwin, and Jason Salda\u00f1a, and the five formed drunkgamers.com, a website where the five reviewed various video games while drunk.<ref>Gross; Konow, 1.</ref> According to Ramsey, the group tried to receive free games to review, but \"incurred the wrath\" of several game developers in doing so.<ref name=\"Konow1\">Konow, 1.</ref>\n\nOne of the non-gameplay videos that the drunkgamers crew created during this time was a live-action parody of the [[Apple Switch ad campaign]].

The series' most popular episode remains [[Goku]] vs [[Superman]], and attracted controversy after calculating that Superman would win the heavily contested debate. Other content includes an animated fight show without research called ''DBX'', a podcast called ''Death Battle Cast'', and an informative show called ''Desk of Death Battle''.\n\nOn February 4, 2019 the ScrewAttack [[YouTube]] channel was re-branded to Death Battle to better match the channel's main content.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://roosterteeth.com/episode/death-battle-cast-2019-good-bye-screwattack |title=We say Goodbye to ScrewAttack - DEATH BATTLE Cast - S4E113 |publisher=Rooster Teeth |access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref> The ScrewAttack section of the Rooster Teeth website was turned into an archive for the channel's old content.\n\nThere are three main characters in the ''Death Battle'' series. Wizard is the rational host for ''Death Battle''. He is a cyborg and scientific genius who provides logical proofs for character attributes. Wiz typically portrays a calm demeanor throughout the series, though becomes upset when his research goes unnoticed. Boomstick, the excitable host for ''Death Battle'', is a fatherless countryman who likes three things: weapons, alcohol, and puns. He provides most of the comic relief in the series. Jocelyn the ''Death Battle'' intern at Rooster Teeth states that she does all the research no one else wants to do for the series. That holds some truth because she demonstrates profound knowledge about battle contestants. Her office, unfortunately, is a closet. Minor characters include Nervous Nick, who performs ''Top 10'' lists for Rooster Teeth.\n\n=== Game Kids ===\n'''Game Kids''' was a division of Rooster Teeth Productions aimed at creating kid and family friendly content. The channel launched on December 1, 2014 and featured the series \"Sim Sisters\" featuring Millie Ramsey, the daughter of Geoff Ramsey, and her nanny Chelsea playing Sims together, \"Kids Play\" featuring Matt Hullum and his children Webb and Mills or Burnie Burns and his children JD and Teddy, appearing on alternating weeks playing various games, and \"Bro Gaming\" featuring Rooster Teeth employee Caleb Denecour and his younger brother Jordan playing various cooperative games including an ongoing series in ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes|Disney Infinity 2.0]]''.

This meant that the branch would provide merchandise, promotion, and other benefits for its partners. On March 28, 2016, a partnership with [[Kinda Funny]] was announced. It was founded by Rooster Teeth co-founder Geoff Ramsey and is run by Luis Medina with Ramsey.
