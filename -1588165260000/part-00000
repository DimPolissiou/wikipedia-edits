The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned ''Time's'' earlier decision to select the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as \"Person of the Century\". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden ''was'' a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to ''Time'', Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.\n\nAnother controversial choice was the 2006 selection of \"[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]\", representing most if not all people for advancing the [[information age]] by using the [[Internet]] (via e.g. [[blogs]], [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]], and [[Wikipedia]]).<ref name=\"you\">{{cite news | author=Lev Grossman | title=You \u2013 Yes, You \u2013 Are Time's Person of the Year | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570810,00.html | work=Time | date=December 13, 2006 | accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawn selections ===\n\nIn 1941, the fictional elephant [[Dumbo]] from the Disney movie of the same name was selected to be \"Mammal of the Year\", and a cover was created showing Dumbo in a formal portrait style.

The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned ''Time's'' earlier decision to select the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as \"Person of the Century\". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden ''was'' a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to ''Time'', Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.\n\nAnother controversial choice was the 2006 selection of \"[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]\", representing most if not all people for advancing the [[information age]] by using the [[Internet]] (via e.g. [[blogs]], [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]], and [[Wikipedia]]).<ref name=\"you\">{{cite news | author=Lev Grossman | title=You \u2013 Yes, You \u2013 Are Time's Person of the Year | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570810,00.html | work=Time | date=December 13, 2006 | accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawn selections ===\n\nIn 1941, the fictional elephant [[Dumbo]] from the Disney movie of the same name was selected to be \"Mammal of the Year\", and a cover was created showing Dumbo in a formal portrait style.

Moore's controversial political documentary ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson's ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview \"I got a call right after the '04 election from an editor from ''Time'' Magazine.

It was serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from April 2005 to June 2012 and the chapters collected into 30 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The series follows Nozomu Itoshiki, a teacher who takes all aspects of life, word, and culture in the most negative light possible. It [[Satire|satirizes]] politics, media, and Japanese society. In 2007, the manga received the 31st [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the [[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|title=Kodansha Manga Awards Page|accessdate=2007-07-17|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qxJiVakM?url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|archivedate=2010-07-03}}</ref> The manga has been adapted into three [[anime]] television series and two sets of [[original video animation|OVA]]s animated by [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] between 2007 and 2010.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei characters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a [[sakura]] tree.  He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees.  She decides to nickname Nozomu {{nihongo|\"Pink Supervisor\"|\u6843\u8272\u4fc2\u9577|Momoiro Kakarich\u014d}}, and offers to pay him fifty [[Japanese yen|yen]] to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his [[homeroom]] class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.\n\nEach chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of ''[[amakudari]]'', the practice of \"descending\" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu \"descending\" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, ''[[omiai]]'', normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the ''negative'' aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a [[Non sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur gag]] or piece of [[fan service]].\n\nWhile ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the [[Taish\u014d period]], the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the [[Sh\u014dwa period]]. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taish\u014d liberalism, Taish\u014d Romanticism (see [[Japanese literature]]) and Taish\u014d arts (see [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a [[kimono]] and [[hakama]] (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taish\u014d period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the [[modern girl]] trend, which is a break from the [[Meiji period]] and signifies the style of the Taish\u014d period.\n\nChapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble [[karuta]] cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted ''kiri-e'' style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of [[katakana]] (rather than [[hiragana]]) as [[okurigana]]. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though [[Emperor Hirohito]] were still alive, such that [[Heisei]] 20 (the twentieth year of [[Emperor Akihito]]'s reign, or 2008 by the [[Gregorian calendar]]) becomes \"Sh\u014dwa 83\".\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei chapters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[K\u014dji Kumeta]].

It was serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from April 2005 to June 2012 and the chapters collected into 30 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The series follows Nozomu Itoshiki, a teacher who takes all aspects of life, word, and culture in the most negative light possible. It [[Satire|satirizes]] politics, media, and Japanese society. In 2007, the manga received the 31st [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the [[sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]] category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|title=Kodansha Manga Awards Page|accessdate=2007-07-17|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qxJiVakM?url=http://www.kodansha.co.jp/award/archive/manga.html|archivedate=2010-07-03}}</ref> The manga has been adapted into three [[anime]] television series and two sets of [[original video animation|OVA]]s animated by [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] between 2007 and 2010.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei characters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a [[sakura]] tree.  He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees.  She decides to nickname Nozomu {{nihongo|\"Pink Supervisor\"|\u6843\u8272\u4fc2\u9577|Momoiro Kakarich\u014d}}, and offers to pay him fifty [[Japanese yen|yen]] to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his [[homeroom]] class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.\n\nEach chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of ''[[amakudari]]'', the practice of \"descending\" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu \"descending\" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, ''[[omiai]]'', normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the ''negative'' aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a [[Non sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur gag]] or piece of [[fan service]].\n\nWhile ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the [[Taish\u014d period]], the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the [[Sh\u014dwa period]]. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taish\u014d liberalism, Taish\u014d Romanticism (see [[Japanese literature]]) and Taish\u014d arts (see [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a [[kimono]] and [[hakama]] (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taish\u014d period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the [[modern girl]] trend, which is a break from the [[Meiji period]] and signifies the style of the Taish\u014d period.\n\nChapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble [[karuta]] cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted ''kiri-e'' style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of [[katakana]] (rather than [[hiragana]]) as [[okurigana]]. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though [[Emperor Hirohito]] were still alive, such that [[Heisei]] 20 (the twentieth year of [[Emperor Akihito]]'s reign, or 2008 by the [[Gregorian calendar]]) becomes \"Sh\u014dwa 83\".\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei chapters}}\n''Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[K\u014dji Kumeta]].

While not lazy, he is very laid-back, often seen sleeping. Manji also has a strange sense of \"honour\" that is in many ways similar to the fighting-ethic of the Itto-Ryu. The fallen [[samurai]] Manji served the ''[[Hatamoto]]'' Horii Shigenobu, a local [[daimy\u014d]], enforcing his brutal rule (unknowingly) on the local populace until he found out his lord was corrupt and killed him. For that he was considered an outlaw and hunted down by the same daimy\u014d clan, achieving the nickname \"''Killer of 100''\" after the body count. He planned to flee to his sister's house even though she had married an officer of the law, Sait\u014d Tatsumasa. Manji ended up killing his sister's husband out of self-defense when he attacked Manji. His sister witnessed her husband's death at the hands of her brother and went insane, reverting to a child-like mindset. Manji settled down to take care of her. At some point during this time, he met Yaobikuni (her name literally means \"nun of eight hundred years\"), a mysterious [[nun]], who gave him the kessen-chu, or sacred bloodworms that made him immortal. Despite the obvious advantages of being nearly invincible, Manji dislikes being immortal. He tries to get Yaobikuni to remove the kessen-chu, finally making a deal with her. He has to kill 1000 bad men, to make up for the 100 good men he killed, if he does this, Yaobikuni will rid him of his immortality. It's worth noting, one reason he doesn't like being immortal is he feels it is making his swordsmanship rusty, because he doesn't have to be as good to win. After his sister is killed (due to a revenge for his actions) he met Rin, whom he accepted to help since he felt she was very much alike to his deceased sister. Manji is constantly trying to make amends for his past actions: he kills his lord to atone for those he killed on the Damiyo's orders; looked after his sister to atone for the deaths of the one hundred cops he killed; and makes the deal to kill one thousand bad men and to look after Rin to make amends for the death of his sister; he takes his role as her protector/surrogate older-brother seriously. However each time Manji tries to do something \"good\", he tends to only make the situation worse (the death of his lord leading to the deaths of one hundred cops, for example).\n\n:He uses many weapons, a good number of which came from defeated opponents. His two short, hooked swords are named Shid\u014d (four paths). His two standard swords are named Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa (Sister Defender Tatsumasa). His two chained scythes are called Mumei (nameless). His double bladed sword-breaker is named Kotengu (Little devil).  Most of his weapons are hidden under his shirt, a seemingly impossible feat given their large number, irregular shapes and lack of sheaths.  One of Manji's signature tricks is to make any of his hidden weapons drop out of his sleeves into one or both of his waiting hands whenever they are needed.\n\n:He first appears in ''Criminal''.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Rin Asano'''|\u6d45\u91ce \u51db|Asano Rin}} {{anime voices|[[Rina Sat\u014d]] (2008 anime), [[Ayane Sakura]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast\"/>|[[Mela Lee]]}}\n\n:The sole survivor of an Itt\u014d-ry\u016b massacre at Anotsu's hand and heir to her father's sword school, the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\". She has mediocre swordsmanship skills but an intense desire to avenge the brutal death of her family. At the beginning of the series she is portrayed as somebody who is trying to act mature, but is still very childish - as the series progresses she steadily \"grows up\" and loses much of her naivety. She hires Manji as her bodyguard in this quest. However, it's not as simple as that - Rin is constantly torn by doubt over the righteousness and validity of her mission and fears becoming a hypocrite as Anotsu claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, especially when he remarks she chooses to use throwing knives instead of a sword like the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\" teaches. She meets Anotsu at one point, but he claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b as she continues her path for revenge. Anotsu's words is causing her to doubt.  When she finally encounters Anotsu in Kaga, she realizes she cannot defeat him and winds up traveling with him. If he starts to trust her, she might get the chance she wants to kill him. But Anotsu is no fool and is fully aware of what she is doing, despite this he allows her presence. She has since left his company, vowing that she will eventually kill him; yet she will stand back for the time being and watch how the events unfold. It is also worth noting that she kisses a sleeping Manji in the fourteenth volume, Last Blood, and has shown on numerous occasions that she develops feelings towards him.  They are as of now largely unreciprocated. She has three weapons, a Chinese sword named Kutoneshirika which she carries in a Toju (purse-like scabbard of sorts), a [[Tant\u014d]] type dagger and a set of small throwing daggers named Ogunchu (Golden Wasps). Even though she is only mediocre in terms of fighting ability, Rin is still more skilled with weapons than most women of that time period and the fact that she carries a small arsenal of weapons with her makes her somewhat unique.  She first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n==Itt\u014d-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagehisa Anotsu'''|\u5929\u6d25 \u5f71\u4e45|Anotsu Kagehisa}} {{anime voices|[[Hirofumi Nojima]] (2008 anime), [[Nozomu Sasaki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-24/new-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-reveals-6-new-cast-members/.150348|title=New Blade of the Immortal Anime Reveals 6 New Cast Members|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-08-24|accessdate=2019-08-24}}</ref>|[[Ezra Weisz]]}}\n\n: Leader of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b and equal of Manji. While painted as the \"villain\" of the series at the start, he has had many scenes devoted to making the reader sympathetic to his views and goals.  An emotionally cold young man has prodigious skill with the sword, and leads the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b in order to form a d\u014dj\u014d dedicated not to form and rules, but to the simple test of superior lethality. Brought up by an abusive grandfather (a swordsman disgraced by the Asano d\u014dj\u014d), Anotsu is as pragmatic and shrewd as he is deadly. He isn't as inhuman as originally believed, as he even allows Rin to live after she attacks him; even letting her follow him everywhere. He is currently at \"war\" with Habaki Kagimura, the leader of the Banshu. Alongside Manji and Makie Otono-Tachibana, Anotsu confronts Habaki Kagimura and his Rokki-Dan in Nakaminato. He eventually slays Habaki in a tightly-contested duel, but is too exhausted to mount a challenge in the subsequent duel with Manji. Manji spares his life but Anotsu is fatally stabbed by Rin during his escape, although it's later hinted that he may have survived the attack. He has two weapons. The first, his main weapon, is a Nepalese-based axe named Kabutsuchi (Head Hammer). The other is his rarely used sword of the same name. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Taito Magatsu'''|\u51f6 \u6234\u6597|Magatsu Taito}} {{anime voices|[[Kazuya Nakai]] (2008 anime), [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n\n: Among the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's finest swordsmen. Of peasant origin, he became a swordsman to avenge his sister, who was killed as a child by a samurai. Taito is one of the few swordsmen who has fought Manji and survived. He has also fought by Manji's side as well. He can be considered a kenshi, a swordsman who is not from the [[samurai]] class.  He despises the government by extension to his hatred of samurai and quits the Itto-ryu when Anotsu allies the group with Kagimura and the shogunate, though he remains on friendly terms with Anotsu.  When his lover of sorts, a prostitute named O-Ren, is killed by Shira, Magatsu ends up following Manji around due to the fact that he knows Shira is after Manji. Although they argue a lot, Manji and Taito have a relatively friendly relationship. In the end Manji allows Taito to find Shira, and despite how much Shira wants to kill Manji, he lets Taito get him. Eventually Shira loses the one hand he had left to Taito and presumably falls to his death.  Concerned by something Shira said, Taito decides to meet up with Anotsu and he eventually rejoins the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  Magatsu later joins Manji and Meguro to finally finish off Shira.  Taito's weapon is a gladius-like triple-sectioned sword named Grand Turk. The main blade is a gladius, the second is a smaller, shorter sword hidden in the handle, the last is a spear-head like dagger hidden within the pommel of the second blade. The sword is curiously missing a sword guard.

Born into a samurai family, Makie and her mother {{nihongo|Fuki|\u4e59\u6a58\u5439|''Otono-Tachibana Fuki''}} were disowned and cast away from the family by her father, {{nihongo|Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd\u7fa9\u660e|''Harukawa Yoshiaki''}}, when Makie's older brother committed [[seppuku]] after Makie was revealed to have inherited the family's famed talent and he was unable to defeat her in combat. She initially choose the path of the sword to avenge her mother's disgrace. She ended up becoming a [[geisha]] after Anotsu bought her freedom because she neither had the nerve to become a prostitute, like her mother, nor commit to becoming a swordfighter, lacking the nerve to kill when her concentration in battle is broken.  She defeats, but does not kill Manji, apparently turning her back on Anotsu. Later found living alone, having bound her hand in an attempt to destroy her own skill in combat after her father's humiliating death. She reappears in Last Blood, having followed Anotsu since he left Shirakawa when she realized his body was weakening, and destroys the nearly all men under Iriya who were pursuing Anotsu. After Iriya's death, she leaves with Anotsu and Magatsu.  She is later stricken with the same lung sickness her father died from while quietly residing with Anotsu and acting as his bodyguard.  When he departs from Edo during Habaki's last effort to destroy the Itto-ryu, Anotsu leaves her behind in order to spare her from fighting again.  However, she pursues him in spite of how her sickness is advancing until she encounters Habaki and the Rokki-dan, where upon she is reunited with Anotsu and Manji and fights alongside them.  As said by Anotsu, she is the only one that can beat him other than Manji, and even Habaki immediately recognizes and fears her skill. Makie is fatally wounded during an ambush by Hanabusa's forces, but manages to kill them all before dying. Her weapon, a double bladed three-section-staff, is named Haru-no-Okina (Old Man of Spring). She conceals her weapon in a hollowed-out [[shamisen]], a mandolin-like instrument. She first appears in ''Dreamsong'' Part 1.\n\n===Other Itt\u014d-ry\u016b===\n* {{nihongo|'''S\u014dsuke Abayama'''|\u963f\u8449\u5c71 \u5b97\u4ecb|Abayama S\u014dsuke}} {{anime voices|[[Shinya Fukumatsu]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>}}\n: Second-in-command of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. An aged swordsman who nevertheless remains one of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's most skilled fighters. A skilled political operative, well suited to handling the d\u014dj\u014d's administrative tasks. He is missing his right arm, and uses a concealed dagger/machete-like weapon with a strange hilt. His missing right arm is actually replaced by three chains with weights which he uses as a weapon against Giichi. He is critically injured by Giichi after an intense battle during the Rokki-Dan pursuit. In the final chapters of the manga, Giichi stumbles upon Abayama, in a decrepit state, being treated by his granddaughter, making him one of the few survivors of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sabato Kuroi'''|\u9ed2\u8863 \u9bd6\u4eba|Kuroi Sabato}} {{anime voices|[[Masashi Ebara]] (2008 anime), Eiji Hanawa (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|Artt Butler}}\n\n: Skilled pupil of Anotsu Sabur\u014d (Anotsu Kagehisa's grandfather) and master Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman.

In addition, Kuroi is so obsessed with ageless beauty that he used taxidermy to preserve the heads of his former wife and Rin's mother, and mounted them on his shoulders. Along with his sword skills, Kuroi uses two shuriken referred to as Karasu, or \"The Crow.\" He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Conquest'' part 3. Kuroi Sabato's is inspired by the band [[Black Sabbath]]; Kuroi Sabato roughly translates into [[Black Sabbath]] from Japanese. Kuroi is a direct translation to the color black.

He first appears in ''On Silent Wings'' part 1, and is later killed by Manji in ''On Silent Wings'' part 6. Renzo then attacks Manji in rage, Manji feigning death. Renzo then makes an assumption his father had a sordid past with Rin at his father's burial, when Rin says, hypothetically, that there are some reasons past incidents shouldn't be brought up, as the blissful ignorance is better than the lifetime of shame.

He said in ''Cry of the Worm'' that the kessen-chu were given to him by Yaobikuni during the [[Muromachi]] period, which means he is two hundred years old. His weapons are a poisoned pair of a dagger and a saber both named Inoue Shinkai Kosatsu (\"Wormkiller\"). He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1, is named in ''Cry of the Worm'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Cry of the Worm'' part 3.

Samura stated he originally was supposed to resemble [[John Lennon]] but he ended up as \"just another [[otaku]] dude\".

Her primary weapon is an odd knife which is fashioned from a spearhead. She appears in the later chapters as one of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's new recruits and greatly admires Anotsu. Doa always travels with her friend Isaku and the two have developed complementary fighting styles. This usually consists of Doa providing the offense with her speed and dagger, while Isaku provides the defense with his armored arms. Her tendency to jump right into battle with little to no provocation often lands her and Isaku in trouble. She ends up befriending Asano Rin.  She and Isaku are both originally from Hokkaido, where Doa was adopted and raised by [[Ainu people|Ainu]], but was treated as an outsider by her contemporaries despite her devotion to the Ainu.  She previously went by the names \"Kuichiru\" and \"Towa\"; her current name, Yoshino, comes from a novel that Anotsu lent her so she would improve her literacy.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Isaku Yasonokami'''|\u516b\u82d1\u72fc \u5937\u4f5c|Yason\u014dkami Isaku}}\n: An Itt\u014d-ry\u016b member of great height (over 1.90 meters/6'2\" tall) and strength. Unlike most members of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, Isaku has no weapons to speak of, instead he wears various piece of armor and tends to act defensively. He is also Doa's best friend and the two always travel together. Isaku often finds himself rescuing Doa, apologizing for her and keeping her from killing others (usually by picking her up and running away). He and Doa have also developed complementary fighting styles, with Isaku acting as the defense and Doa as the offense. He ends up befriending Asano Rin. In reality, he is a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Christians|Christian]] and the son of a priest. He is not incredibly intelligent, but is kindhearted.

He is an elderly man with a long white beard and unknown to Habaki, Kashin has been making highly detailed maps of his castle as he performs medical services in Habaki's stronghold.

He is killed in battle by Ryo of Rokki-Dan.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Ozuhan'''|\u6016\u7554}}\n: A masked member of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b who appears to be deaf and communicates through the use of sign language and simple sounds.  He is one of the ten core members of the group.  He is known as \"the guy no one wants to fight beside\" because of his use of a hypnotic flute to fight. Ozuhan, himself, is immune to the effects of his instrument.  He is extremely agile and highly aware of his surroundings, allowing him to escape most traps; originally sent to Habaki's stronghold to aid Rin and Doa, he escapes from the same castle during Anotsu's raid and is separated from the group afterward.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sukezane Baro'''|\u99ac\u7d7d \u7950\u5b9f|Baro Sukezane}}\n: A powerful and skilled swordsman of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, he conducts espionage related activities and is one of the ten core members of the group.  He carries two katana that he wields effectively, but his trademark weapon is a third sword, a [[nodachi]] with holes along the entire blade that allow him to retain his remarkable speed.  Among his distinguishing features is a scar that runs across his nose, which results in Manji being mistaken for Sukezane during Habaki's final attempt to wipe out the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. He sacrifices himself against shogunate guards so Anotsu and Magatsu can escape after their raid on Edo castle.\n\n==Mugai-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagimura Habaki'''|\u5410 \u9264\u7fa4|Habaki Kagimura}} {{anime voices|[[Takayuki Sugo]] (2008 anime), [[Jouji Nakata]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n:The leader of the Shogun's Banshu samurai, the Bangashira, and his household included his wife Shima, son Sakutaro and daughter to a concubine, Ryo who dotes on him. He is secretly the leader of the Mugai-ry\u016b and later the Rokki-Dan and becomes the main antagonist of the story. He simultaneously invites the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b to become an official sword school while directing the Mugai-ry\u016b against it. Kagimura also masterminded and took part in the massacre that occurred during a feast welcoming the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b into the Banshu. Abayama's comments imply that he is incredibly skilled with a sword, which he proves by his attack on Manji in Trickster, volume 15, however, the battle costs him an eye and Manji escapes the secret prison in which he is held, resulting in Habaki's removal from office and orders for him to take his life.  However, he is given the opportunity to die with honour and is given one month, along with the control of the assassins of the Rokki-dan, to fully eradicate the Itto-ryu and its leader.  With nothing to lose, he ruthlessly pursues Anotsu before finally catching up to him, along with Manji, Rin, and Makie. He is blinded during his duel with Anotsu, which combined with Manji's untimely interference leads to a fatal error while anticipating Anotsu's final attack. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Hyakurin'''|\u767e\u7433|Hyakurin}} {{anime voices|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]] (2008 anime), [[Marika Hayashi]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n: A female [[assassination|assassin]] and a [[lieutenant]] in the Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin was the wife of an abusive samurai, Hayakawa Kak\u014dsai Genkei, who was obsessed with trying to gain fame by training Matsuhiko, their sickly son, to become a strong swordsman. He killed Matsuhiko's unnamed twin sister shortly after her birth because he saw no worth in raising a girl and then killed Matsuhiko foer failing to meet his expectations. She later kills her husband to avenge the death of her children and is then arrested and sentenced to death. Her case came to the attention of Kagimura who subsequently recruited her into Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin's most unusual physical trait is her blonde hair (concealed frequently under a wig), which she maintains by bleaching it with a strong chemical as a compulsive desire to remove bloodstains from it. While her skills with a sword are unremarkable, she has an extensive knowledge of poisons. This knowledge carries over into her choice of weaponry, a collapsible wrist mounted crossbow with poisoned bolts named Burafuma (Little Steps). The crossbow also possesses two blades such that when the weapon is collapsed, Hyakurin can use it to stab her opponents. After volume 11, Beasts, her skills are impeded after being tortured and having her arm smashed. She later becomes pregnant and ends up \"retired\" from the Mugai-ry\u016b because of a deal between Habaki and Giichi when Giichi earns his freedom.  She has no desire to keep the child because she believes she will be reminded of Shinriji's death and the faces of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b men who raped her.  She first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shira'''|\u5c38\u826f|Shira}} {{anime voices|[[Shin-ichiro Miki]] (2008 anime), [[T\u014dru Nara]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A cold-blooded killer in the Mugai-ry\u016b. He's responsible for the death of Magatsu Taito's close friend, O-Ren. Shira's a sadistic psychopath who derives sexual pleasure in the torture and murder of his victims, particularly young women. After an attempt to ambush Anotsu goes horribly wrong and he tries to take it out on his attackers. He uses the saw-blade side of his sword to hack of some of their limbs, and then tries to rape a prostitute that was with them while cutting her up at the same time. Rin tries to stop him but is slapped away, Manji arrives and manages to take off Shira's hand before he runs off. Following this incident he cuts some flesh from his injured arm, and sharpens the bones into spikes. His hair turns stark white due to the trauma he caused himself. He develops an obsession with revenge on Manji which leads to him betraying his Mugai-ry\u016b comrades, causing the death of Shinriji and capture of Hyakurin. Later, his quest for revenge against Manji leads to a battle with Magatsu Taito, who was traveling with Manji specifically so he could find Shira. This battle further cripples him with the loss of his remaining hand. Recently he's been shown to be imprisoned in the same prison Manji is currently being held in, and has been set parameters/lists as to whom he shall face before being allowed to fight Manji (this list includes Magatsu). He also states that he has since lost one eye, and has a new \"weapon\" of sorts. No longer being able to feel pain, he steals Manji's missing left arm and attaches to his own, gaining bloodworms.  He is eventually killed by Manji after an intense battle due to overextending his immortality by getting cut up too much while his bloodworms were weakened by the winter cold and his body is left to be eaten by dogs. However, before he finally succumbs to the pack of dogs, he tells Renzo not to become pure evil like himself, not to listen to men like him anymore and to give up his pursuit of Manji's death; saying that Renzo isn't cut out for a life of vengeance. He uses a ninja-to sword, with a saw edge on one side of the blade. He usually uses the regular side to immobilize opponents by cutting off their legs, and then uses the saw-blade to cut off other parts of the body and cause maximum pain. This sword is named \"Hotosogi\" or woman shadow eraser. However, there is a second meaning for \"Hotosogi\" which also fits Shira's sadistic nature; when the kanji for woman and shadow are used together they become vagina. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 2 and is first named in ''Dark Shadows'' part 3.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Giichi'''|\u507d\u4e00|Giichi<!--It's Gi-ichi but written as \"Giichi\"-->}} {{anime voices|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] (2008 anime), Hiroshi Shirokuma (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[David Vincent (actor)|David Vincent]]}}\n: The strongest Mugai-ry\u016b killer, aside from the immortality enhanced Shira. Though little is initially known about his past or reasons for being sentenced to death, it is eventually revealed that after Giichi's wife died, he devoted himself to raising their sickly son, Tojiro.  However, as a poor shipwright, the cost of doctors, medicine, and interest forced Giichi to resort to crime until he was caught and recruited by Habaki.  Giichi is one of the most skilled fighters in the series, having killed a total of 59 Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsmen on his own. Of the Mugai-ry\u016b, he is the only member who manages to garner enough kills to earn his freedom; however, this achievement means little to him when he learns at the same time that Tojiro has suddenly died. He works closely with Kagimura Habaki and cares for the other Mugai-ry\u016b, attempting to buy Hyakurin's freedom as well, unsuccessfully.  He disappears when Habaki dissolves the Mugai-ry\u016b and is later found living in among the [[burakumin]] by Rin and Hyakurin, where he provides Rin with information concerning Manji's whereabouts.  Now a broken man, he deliberately distances himself from Hyakurin to keep her from suffering any more pain and is aware of her pregnancy - when she tries to kill her baby, he stops her and persuades her to carry the child to term and allow him to raise the baby after it is born. He eventually agrees to work briefly for Habaki once again against the Itto-ryu; he and Hyakurin attack Abayama Sosuke, with Giichi taking on Abayama himself in a bloody battle that ends with Giichi defeating Abayama at the cost of an ear. He uses a unique weapon which resembles an oversized bladed handcuff attached to a length of chain. The weapon, Kanetsura's Mito-no-Kami (Guardian of the Three Paths), was adapted from a thresher or similar farming implement, and allows him to sever or entangle limbs, necks and weapons from a distance. It is hard to block as the handcuff like action will wrap it around what it hits, but it is broken by Manji in Volume 14: Last Blood. Manji gave Giichi one of his own weapons, two curved blades attached by a chain, that Giichi now uses though he claims he is only borrowing it. Giichi's first appearance is in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shinriji'''|\u771f\u7406\u8def|Shinriji}} {{anime voices|[[Y\u016bya Uchida (voice actor)|Yuya Uchida]] (2008 anime), Chikahiro Kobayashi (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n: A bumbling Mugai-ry\u016b swordsman. He was apparently a pickpocket and thief prior to joining the Mugai-ry\u016b. After attending a sword school, he worked for a silk merchant. Disgruntled by his low wages, he stole money from the merchant and left. Shinriji intentionally stole 1 ryo less than 10 ryo to avoid the death penalty. Unfortunately for him, they added the money he earned legitimately to the total. He worked most closely with Hyakurin and developed a crush on her, viewing her as a surrogate mother, her blonde hair reminding him of his foreign mother. While he's not highly skilled with a sword, he does have a firm grasp of dimensions as noted by Kinuka, and is implied by Kagimura to have much potential. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1, and is later killed by Kinuka, but not before taking out four Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  As he dies, he positions himself to point south-east (archaically called ''tatsumi'') in order to tell Giichi that Hyakurin has been taken to the ''Tatsumi'' district of Edo.  As a sign of respect, Hyakurin cuts her hair and places the tied locks on his gravesite.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makoto'''|\u771f\u7434|Makoto}} {{anime voices|[[Wataru Hatano]]|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A former male prostitute, Makoto was recruited to be the group's mole within the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.

He was a key player in the massacre which occurred during a feast meant to celebrate the official union of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b with Banshu, slipping poison into the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's food.

After Mouzen's failure, Burando is assigned by Habaki to succeed at achieving immortality; though he does not do so within the time limit, Habaki allows Burando to continue since Burando has produced results. He zealously conducts experiments on Manji and other prisoners to replicate Manji's immortality with utmost understanding of the human anatomy. However, his obsession results in the brutal deaths of a large number of prisoners and he is driven mad by his obsession.

When Rin breaks into the prison to save Manji, she and Doa are confronted by Asaemon in Manji's cell; Asaemon, in turn, is killed by Manji.  His liver is later used by Manji as medicine for Makie's tuberculosis, despite her aversion to idea of consuming human liver.\n\n==Rokki-dan==\n{{nihongo|Rokki-dan|\u516d\u9b3c\u56e3|Six Demon Group}} are a private army divided into six divisions and fall under Habaki Kagimura's direct command.

Habaki's family appears to be unaware of her, while Ryo cares deeply for both Sakutaro and Shima, Habaki's son and wife respectively.  Though Habaki arranges for her to become a ward of one of his allies, Ryo would rather die helping him by taking the vacant seat among the member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division.  However, despite her regular training, her skills as a sword fighter are mediocre in comparison to the considerably more powerful combatants existing in the series, a fact she is aware of.  After returning as the only survivor of a mission in which she kills Koji Kashin, Habaki releases her from the Rokki-dan.  Desperate to follow her father, Magatsu finds her feverish and collapsed on the ground and reluctantly takes her with him as he attempts to catch up to Anotsu, during which Ryo makes the request for Magatsu to take her as a pupil.

A large man with a scar on the top of his head making it look lopsided and wears his hair in a series of coils. Fighting with large wide blades that can crush as well as cut, and possessing a heavily armored body that limits his opponent's avenues of attack, he proves to be a formidable opponent and manages to sever Manji's body in half during their fight.  Rin takes advantage of Arashino's pity and duplicituously makes it appear that Manji's body isn't recovering from damage and then sets Arashino's body on fire, allowing Manji gain the advantage to kill him.\n*{{nihongo|'''Shinhei Doma'''|\u5f29\u99ac \u5fc3\u5175}}: A member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division, he uses a nunchaku-like weapon.

She is also a student of Master Sori, whom she is infatuated with, and becomes friends with Rin, who works as Sori's housekeeper. Her attempts to have him accept her affections are usually misconstrued and her artistic style and poor cooking ability do little to impress Sori, who appears to be oblivious.

Has the dubious honor of being Manji's first victim to appear in the graphic novel. His first appearance and death both occur in ''Criminal''. His name is a homage to [[John Lydon]]'s stage name while heading the British punk band [[Sex Pistols]], Johnny Rotten (\"Gyobutsu\" roughly translates as ''rotten fish'').\n* {{nihongo|'''Hishiyasu Shido'''|\u53f8\u6238\u3000\u83f1\u5b89|Shido Hishiyasu}} {{anime voices|[[Kentarou Itou]]|[[Kyle Hebert]]}}: Leader of the world's baddest ronin gang, the [[Shinsengumi]]. After Manji killed his brother \"Johnny\", Hishiyasu sought revenge by kidnapping Manji's sister, Machi, to use her as bait. When Manji would not submit to a duel, and offered only to fight barehanded, Hishiyasu lets Machi go only to kill her immediately after. He has two pronged swords that have the word \"ACID\" on the [[tsuba]]. After the death of his sister, Manji is able to accept his fate and proceeds to kill the entire ronin gang, starting with Shido Hishiyasu. His first appearance and death both occur in ''Criminal''. Like Johnny, he has his name based on a member of Sex Pistols, bassist [[Sid Vicious]] (being Shido's name an almost literal romanization).\n*{{nihongo|'''Sori'''|\u5b97\u7406}} {{anime voices|[[Tomokazu Seki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>}}\n: A high-ranking spy and ninja obsessed with art, driven into political intrigue in order to gain access to European art, which is contraband in that period. Master S\u014dri has a daughter named Tatsu and is a childhood friend of the Asano clan. Rin goes to him hoping he will be another sword against Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. He refuses to offer any help at first but is soon able to provide Rin with thirty ry\u014d. He later assists Manji after he is injured, and informs him about who is behind the Mugai-ry\u016b. Also hires Magatsu to watch over his daughter while he is away painting, and is later revealed that may have greater interest in Magatsu (to which Manji notes after his conversation with Magatsu in volume 12, Autumn Frost). He first appears in Genius part 1.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tatsu'''|\u8fb0}}: Known also as Tatsub\u014d; Sori's daughter, a practical young woman who does not appear to be aware of most of her father's activities beyond sword fighting and is a childhood friend of Rin. She ends up taking care of Manji after he is severely injured by the Itto-Ryu while attempting to obtain a ''tsuko tegata'' to enter Kaga and follow Rin. She appears to be capable of taking care of her family's house, since Magatsu, who was hired by Sori to protect Tatsu, leaves with Manji in search of Shira even though Sori is still off painting.  By the time Rin and Manji return, Tatsu has apparently married a local merchant's son, while Rin winds up helping Sori out with household tasks.  She returns to her father's home after divorcing her husband because she had become fed up with how overbearing he was to her just as Rin and Manji are about to depart in search of Anotsu again.\n* {{nihongo|'''Renzo Kawakami'''|\u5ddd\u4e0a \u932c\u9020|Kawakami Renz\u014d}}: Son of Itto-Ryu member Araya Kawakami. Rin befriends him, only to discover his father was the one responsible for raping and then killing her mother.  She and Manji orchestrate a scene where it appears that Manji murdered Araya in cold blood and then was killed by Renzo so Renzo would not seek revenge like Rin.  After being orphaned by Manji, he is now Shira's hand both literally and figuratively.\n*{{nihongo|'''Shima Habaki'''|\u5410 \u5fd7\u6469|''Habaki Shima''}} {{nihongo|'''Sakutaro'''|\u5410 \u7d22\u592a\u90ce|''Habaki Sakutar\u014d''}}: The strong willed, proud and loyal wife of Habaki and his young son. When Habaki is condemned by his successor Hanabusa after failing to capture the Itto-ryu and producing results for the immortality experiment, Shima and Sakutaro are arrested in order to secure Habaki's cooperation.  When Ryo attempts to save them, Shima astutely realizes that Ryo is Habaki's illegitimate daughter.  To atone for her husband's perceived failure, Shima deliberately kills both their son and herself before Hanabusa and Habaki to ensure that Habaki will no longer have any obstacles to destroy the Itto-ryu.  Their deaths have a devastating impact on Habaki who cares greatly for both of them.\n*{{nihongo|'''Ugen Hanabusa'''|\u82f1\u4e8e\u5f66|''Hanabusa Ugen''}}: Previously subordinate to Habaki, Hanabusa becomes Habaki's successor when Habaki is forced to accept that he has failed to contain the Itto-ryu and produce successful results from the Immortality Experiment.  Though Hanabusa is cunning, his ability to scheme his way into ensuring Habaki's downfall by negotiating with the Itto-ryu fails largely due to Hanabusa's inability to match Habaki's ruthless determination and being unable to truly anticipate the movements of Anotsu and the Itto-ryu.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Blade of the Immortal}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Blade of the Immortal]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Blade of the Immortal'' characters}}\nThis is a list of characters from the manga series ''[[Blade of the Immortal]]''.\n\n==Main characters==\n* {{nihongo|'''Manji'''|\u534d|Manji}} {{anime voices|[[Tomokazu Seki]] (2008 anime), [[Kenjiro Tsuda]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-08/new-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-staff-october-premiere-amazon-only-streaming/.149843|title=New Blade of the Immortal Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Staff, October Premiere, Amazon-only Streaming|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-08-08|accessdate=2019-08-08}}</ref>|[[Keith Silverstein]]}}\n\n:The immortal referred to in the title. While not lazy, he is very laid-back, often seen sleeping. Manji also has a strange sense of \"honour\" that is in many ways similar to the fighting-ethic of the Itto-Ryu. The fallen [[samurai]] Manji served the ''[[Hatamoto]]'' Horii Shigenobu, a local [[daimy\u014d]], enforcing his brutal rule (unknowingly) on the local populace until he found out his lord was corrupt and killed him. For that he was considered an outlaw and hunted down by the same daimy\u014d clan, achieving the nickname \"''Killer of 100''\" after the body count. He planned to flee to his sister's house even though she had married an officer of the law, Sait\u014d Tatsumasa. Manji ended up killing his sister's husband out of self-defense when he attacked Manji. His sister witnessed her husband's death at the hands of her brother and went insane, reverting to a child-like mindset. Manji settled down to take care of her. At some point during this time, he met Yaobikuni (her name literally means \"nun of eight hundred years\"), a mysterious [[nun]], who gave him the kessen-chu, or sacred bloodworms that made him immortal. Despite the obvious advantages of being nearly invincible, Manji dislikes being immortal. He tries to get Yaobikuni to remove the kessen-chu, finally making a deal with her. He has to kill 1000 bad men, to make up for the 100 good men he killed, if he does this, Yaobikuni will rid him of his immortality. It's worth noting, one reason he doesn't like being immortal is he feels it is making his swordsmanship rusty, because he doesn't have to be as good to win. After his sister is killed (due to a revenge for his actions) he met Rin, whom he accepted to help since he felt she was very much alike to his deceased sister. Manji is constantly trying to make amends for his past actions: he kills his lord to atone for those he killed on the Damiyo's orders; looked after his sister to atone for the deaths of the one hundred cops he killed; and makes the deal to kill one thousand bad men and to look after Rin to make amends for the death of his sister; he takes his role as her protector/surrogate older-brother seriously. However each time Manji tries to do something \"good\", he tends to only make the situation worse (the death of his lord leading to the deaths of one hundred cops, for example).\n\n:He uses many weapons, a good number of which came from defeated opponents. His two short, hooked swords are named Shid\u014d (four paths). His two standard swords are named Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa (Sister Defender Tatsumasa). His two chained scythes are called Mumei (nameless). His double bladed sword-breaker is named Kotengu (Little devil).  Most of his weapons are hidden under his shirt, a seemingly impossible feat given their large number, irregular shapes and lack of sheaths.  One of Manji's signature tricks is to make any of his hidden weapons drop out of his sleeves into one or both of his waiting hands whenever they are needed.\n\n:He first appears in ''Criminal''.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Rin Asano'''|\u6d45\u91ce \u51db|Asano Rin}} {{anime voices|[[Rina Sat\u014d]] (2008 anime), [[Ayane Sakura]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast\"/>|[[Mela Lee]]}}\n\n:The sole survivor of an Itt\u014d-ry\u016b massacre at Anotsu's hand and heir to her father's sword school, the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\". She has mediocre swordsmanship skills but an intense desire to avenge the brutal death of her family. At the beginning of the series she is portrayed as somebody who is trying to act mature, but is still very childish - as the series progresses she steadily \"grows up\" and loses much of her naivety. She hires Manji as her bodyguard in this quest. However, it's not as simple as that - Rin is constantly torn by doubt over the righteousness and validity of her mission and fears becoming a hypocrite as Anotsu claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, especially when he remarks she chooses to use throwing knives instead of a sword like the \"Mutenichi-ry\u016b\" teaches. She meets Anotsu at one point, but he claims that she is more like the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b as she continues her path for revenge. Anotsu's words is causing her to doubt.  When she finally encounters Anotsu in Kaga, she realizes she cannot defeat him and winds up traveling with him. If he starts to trust her, she might get the chance she wants to kill him. But Anotsu is no fool and is fully aware of what she is doing, despite this he allows her presence. She has since left his company, vowing that she will eventually kill him; yet she will stand back for the time being and watch how the events unfold. It is also worth noting that she kisses a sleeping Manji in the fourteenth volume, Last Blood, and has shown on numerous occasions that she develops feelings towards him.  They are as of now largely unreciprocated. She has three weapons, a Chinese sword named Kutoneshirika which she carries in a Toju (purse-like scabbard of sorts), a [[Tant\u014d]] type dagger and a set of small throwing daggers named Ogunchu (Golden Wasps). Even though she is only mediocre in terms of fighting ability, Rin is still more skilled with weapons than most women of that time period and the fact that she carries a small arsenal of weapons with her makes her somewhat unique.  She first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n==Itt\u014d-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagehisa Anotsu'''|\u5929\u6d25 \u5f71\u4e45|Anotsu Kagehisa}} {{anime voices|[[Hirofumi Nojima]] (2008 anime), [[Nozomu Sasaki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-24/new-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-reveals-6-new-cast-members/.150348|title=New Blade of the Immortal Anime Reveals 6 New Cast Members|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-08-24|accessdate=2019-08-24}}</ref>|[[Ezra Weisz]]}}\n\n: Leader of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b and equal of Manji. While painted as the \"villain\" of the series at the start, he has had many scenes devoted to making the reader sympathetic to his views and goals.  An emotionally cold young man has prodigious skill with the sword, and leads the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b in order to form a d\u014dj\u014d dedicated not to form and rules, but to the simple test of superior lethality. Brought up by an abusive grandfather (a swordsman disgraced by the Asano d\u014dj\u014d), Anotsu is as pragmatic and shrewd as he is deadly. He isn't as inhuman as originally believed, as he even allows Rin to live after she attacks him; even letting her follow him everywhere. He is currently at \"war\" with Habaki Kagimura, the leader of the Banshu. Alongside Manji and Makie Otono-Tachibana, Anotsu confronts Habaki Kagimura and his Rokki-Dan in Nakaminato. He eventually slays Habaki in a tightly-contested duel, but is too exhausted to mount a challenge in the subsequent duel with Manji. Manji spares his life but Anotsu is fatally stabbed by Rin during his escape, although it's later hinted that he may have survived the attack. He has two weapons. The first, his main weapon, is a Nepalese-based axe named Kabutsuchi (Head Hammer). The other is his rarely used sword of the same name. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Taito Magatsu'''|\u51f6 \u6234\u6597|Magatsu Taito}} {{anime voices|[[Kazuya Nakai]] (2008 anime), [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n\n: Among the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's finest swordsmen. Of peasant origin, he became a swordsman to avenge his sister, who was killed as a child by a samurai. Taito is one of the few swordsmen who has fought Manji and survived. He has also fought by Manji's side as well. He can be considered a kenshi, a swordsman who is not from the [[samurai]] class.  He despises the government by extension to his hatred of samurai and quits the Itto-ryu when Anotsu allies the group with Kagimura and the shogunate, though he remains on friendly terms with Anotsu.  When his lover of sorts, a prostitute named O-Ren, is killed by Shira, Magatsu ends up following Manji around due to the fact that he knows Shira is after Manji. Although they argue a lot, Manji and Taito have a relatively friendly relationship. In the end Manji allows Taito to find Shira, and despite how much Shira wants to kill Manji, he lets Taito get him. Eventually Shira loses the one hand he had left to Taito and presumably falls to his death.  Concerned by something Shira said, Taito decides to meet up with Anotsu and he eventually rejoins the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  Magatsu later joins Manji and Meguro to finally finish off Shira.  Taito's weapon is a gladius-like triple-sectioned sword named Grand Turk. The main blade is a gladius, the second is a smaller, shorter sword hidden in the handle, the last is a spear-head like dagger hidden within the pommel of the second blade. The sword is curiously missing a sword guard. First appears in ''Conquest'' part 1, first named in ''Fanatic'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makie Otono-Tachibana'''|\u4e59\u6a58 \u69c7\u7d75|Otono-Tachibana Makie}} {{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]] (2008 anime), [[Houko Kuwashima]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|[[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]}}\n\n: Master swordswoman and in love with Anotsu.  Possibly the most skilled swordsfighter in the manga, she is said to be Anotsu's match and saved his life with her deadly abilities when they were children. Born into a samurai family, Makie and her mother {{nihongo|Fuki|\u4e59\u6a58\u5439|''Otono-Tachibana Fuki''}} were disowned and cast away from the family by her father, {{nihongo|Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd\u7fa9\u660e|''Harukawa Yoshiaki''}}, when Makie's older brother committed [[seppuku]] after Makie was revealed to have inherited the family's famed talent and he was unable to defeat her in combat. She initially choose the path of the sword to avenge her mother's disgrace. She ended up becoming a [[geisha]] after Anotsu bought her freedom because she neither had the nerve to become a prostitute, like her mother, nor commit to becoming a swordfighter, lacking the nerve to kill when her concentration in battle is broken.  She defeats, but does not kill Manji, apparently turning her back on Anotsu. Later found living alone, having bound her hand in an attempt to destroy her own skill in combat after her father's humiliating death. She reappears in Last Blood, having followed Anotsu since he left Shirakawa when she realized his body was weakening, and destroys the nearly all men under Iriya who were pursuing Anotsu. After Iriya's death, she leaves with Anotsu and Magatsu.  She is later stricken with the same lung sickness her father died from while quietly residing with Anotsu and acting as his bodyguard.  When he departs from Edo during Habaki's last effort to destroy the Itto-ryu, Anotsu leaves her behind in order to spare her from fighting again.  However, she pursues him in spite of how her sickness is advancing until she encounters Habaki and the Rokki-dan, where upon she is reunited with Anotsu and Manji and fights alongside them.  As said by Anotsu, she is the only one that can beat him other than Manji, and even Habaki immediately recognizes and fears her skill. Makie is fatally wounded during an ambush by Hanabusa's forces, but manages to kill them all before dying. Her weapon, a double bladed three-section-staff, is named Haru-no-Okina (Old Man of Spring). She conceals her weapon in a hollowed-out [[shamisen]], a mandolin-like instrument. She first appears in ''Dreamsong'' Part 1.\n\n===Other Itt\u014d-ry\u016b===\n* {{nihongo|'''S\u014dsuke Abayama'''|\u963f\u8449\u5c71 \u5b97\u4ecb|Abayama S\u014dsuke}} {{anime voices|[[Shinya Fukumatsu]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>}}\n: Second-in-command of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. An aged swordsman who nevertheless remains one of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's most skilled fighters. A skilled political operative, well suited to handling the d\u014dj\u014d's administrative tasks. He is missing his right arm, and uses a concealed dagger/machete-like weapon with a strange hilt. His missing right arm is actually replaced by three chains with weights which he uses as a weapon against Giichi. He is critically injured by Giichi after an intense battle during the Rokki-Dan pursuit. In the final chapters of the manga, Giichi stumbles upon Abayama, in a decrepit state, being treated by his granddaughter, making him one of the few survivors of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sabato Kuroi'''|\u9ed2\u8863 \u9bd6\u4eba|Kuroi Sabato}} {{anime voices|[[Masashi Ebara]] (2008 anime), Eiji Hanawa (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>|Artt Butler}}\n\n: Skilled pupil of Anotsu Sabur\u014d (Anotsu Kagehisa's grandfather) and master Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman. Along with his skills with a sword, Kuroi has several quirks, which includes poetry referencing [[Black Sabbath]] appearing whenever he does. In addition, Kuroi is so obsessed with ageless beauty that he used taxidermy to preserve the heads of his former wife and Rin's mother, and mounted them on his shoulders. Along with his sword skills, Kuroi uses two shuriken referred to as Karasu, or \"The Crow.\" He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Conquest'' part 3. Kuroi Sabato's is inspired by the band [[Black Sabbath]]; Kuroi Sabato roughly translates into [[Black Sabbath]] from Japanese. Kuroi is a direct translation to the color black. ''Sabato'' when romanized, can be taken as \"Sabbath.\" Black Sabbath is one of Hiroaki Samura's favorite bands.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Araya Kawakami'''|\u5ddd\u4e0a \u65b0\u591c|Kawakami Araya}} {{anime voices|[[Daisuke Namikawa]] (2008 anime), Masato Obara (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-09-13/blade-of-the-immortal-anime-reveals-9-more-cast-members/.151062|title=Blade of the Immortal Anime Reveals 9 More Cast Members|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2019-09-13|accessdate=2019-09-13}}</ref>|[[Liam O'Brien]]}}\n: An Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsman living as a mask-maker. Determined to conceal his past from his son, Renzo, he is also the man who led the rape of Rin's mother. He first appears in ''On Silent Wings'' part 1, and is later killed by Manji in ''On Silent Wings'' part 6. Renzo then attacks Manji in rage, Manji feigning death. Renzo then makes an assumption his father had a sordid past with Rin at his father's burial, when Rin says, hypothetically, that there are some reasons past incidents shouldn't be brought up, as the blissful ignorance is better than the lifetime of shame. He appears in ''On Silent Wings'' (I-VI).\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Eiku Shizuma'''|\u9591\u99ac \u6c38\u7a7a|Shizuma Eiku}} {{anime voices|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]] (2008 anime), [[Shunsuke Sakuya]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-2\"/>m|James Hoover}}\n\n: Immortal swordsman usually dressed as a [[Komus\u014d|monk]] wearing a basket hat. Gifted with the same blood-worms as Manji, he seeks to gain Manji as an ally to overthrow Anotsu. He said in ''Cry of the Worm'' that the kessen-chu were given to him by Yaobikuni during the [[Muromachi]] period, which means he is two hundred years old. His weapons are a poisoned pair of a dagger and a saber both named Inoue Shinkai Kosatsu (\"Wormkiller\"). He first appears in ''Conquest'' part 1, is named in ''Cry of the Worm'' part 1 and is later killed by Manji in ''Cry of the Worm'' part 3.

Samura stated he originally was supposed to resemble [[John Lennon]] but he ended up as \"just another [[otaku]] dude\". His glasses have a similar shape to those of [[Spider Jerusalem]], one being round and the other quadratic.

Her primary weapon is an odd knife which is fashioned from a spearhead. She appears in the later chapters as one of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's new recruits and greatly admires Anotsu. Doa always travels with her friend Isaku and the two have developed complementary fighting styles. This usually consists of Doa providing the offense with her speed and dagger, while Isaku provides the defense with his armored arms. Her tendency to jump right into battle with little to no provocation often lands her and Isaku in trouble. She ends up befriending Asano Rin.  She and Isaku are both originally from Hokkaido, where Doa was adopted and raised by [[Ainu people|Ainu]], but was treated as an outsider by her contemporaries despite her devotion to the Ainu.  She previously went by the names \"Kuichiru\" and \"Towa\"; her current name, Yoshino, comes from a novel that Anotsu lent her so she would improve her literacy.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Isaku Yasonokami'''|\u516b\u82d1\u72fc \u5937\u4f5c|Yason\u014dkami Isaku}}\n: An Itt\u014d-ry\u016b member of great height (over 1.90 meters/6'2\" tall) and strength. Unlike most members of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, Isaku has no weapons to speak of, instead he wears various piece of armor and tends to act defensively. He is also Doa's best friend and the two always travel together. Isaku often finds himself rescuing Doa, apologizing for her and keeping her from killing others (usually by picking her up and running away). He and Doa have also developed complementary fighting styles, with Isaku acting as the defense and Doa as the offense. He ends up befriending Asano Rin. In reality, he is a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Christians|Christian]] and the son of a priest. He is not incredibly intelligent, but is kindhearted. Is cut in two as a result of the experiments in Habaki's compound, only to be reassembled by Doa - he briefly has similar regenerative abilities to Manji, which gradually wear off.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Koji Kashin'''|\u679c\u5fc3\u5c45\u58eb|Kashin Koji}}\n: A spy and doctor for the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, one of the ten core members of the group; he operates in Edo under the alias of {{nihongo|''Mizushina-sensei''|\u6c34\u79d1 \u5148\u751f}}.  He is an elderly man with a long white beard and unknown to Habaki, Kashin has been making highly detailed maps of his castle as he performs medical services in Habaki's stronghold.  These maps are later used to aid Rin and Doa as they infiltrate Habaki's castle to find and rescue Manji and Isaku. He is killed in battle by Ryo of Rokki-Dan.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Ozuhan'''|\u6016\u7554}}\n: A masked member of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b who appears to be deaf and communicates through the use of sign language and simple sounds.  He is one of the ten core members of the group.  He is known as \"the guy no one wants to fight beside\" because of his use of a hypnotic flute to fight. Ozuhan, himself, is immune to the effects of his instrument.  He is extremely agile and highly aware of his surroundings, allowing him to escape most traps; originally sent to Habaki's stronghold to aid Rin and Doa, he escapes from the same castle during Anotsu's raid and is separated from the group afterward.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Sukezane Baro'''|\u99ac\u7d7d \u7950\u5b9f|Baro Sukezane}}\n: A powerful and skilled swordsman of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, he conducts espionage related activities and is one of the ten core members of the group.  He carries two katana that he wields effectively, but his trademark weapon is a third sword, a [[nodachi]] with holes along the entire blade that allow him to retain his remarkable speed.  Among his distinguishing features is a scar that runs across his nose, which results in Manji being mistaken for Sukezane during Habaki's final attempt to wipe out the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. He sacrifices himself against shogunate guards so Anotsu and Magatsu can escape after their raid on Edo castle.\n\n==Mugai-ry\u016b==\n* {{nihongo|'''Kagimura Habaki'''|\u5410 \u9264\u7fa4|Habaki Kagimura}} {{anime voices|[[Takayuki Sugo]] (2008 anime), [[Jouji Nakata]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n:The leader of the Shogun's Banshu samurai, the Bangashira, and his household included his wife Shima, son Sakutaro and daughter to a concubine, Ryo who dotes on him. He is secretly the leader of the Mugai-ry\u016b and later the Rokki-Dan and becomes the main antagonist of the story. He simultaneously invites the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b to become an official sword school while directing the Mugai-ry\u016b against it. Kagimura also masterminded and took part in the massacre that occurred during a feast welcoming the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b into the Banshu. Abayama's comments imply that he is incredibly skilled with a sword, which he proves by his attack on Manji in Trickster, volume 15, however, the battle costs him an eye and Manji escapes the secret prison in which he is held, resulting in Habaki's removal from office and orders for him to take his life.  However, he is given the opportunity to die with honour and is given one month, along with the control of the assassins of the Rokki-dan, to fully eradicate the Itto-ryu and its leader.  With nothing to lose, he ruthlessly pursues Anotsu before finally catching up to him, along with Manji, Rin, and Makie. He is blinded during his duel with Anotsu, which combined with Manji's untimely interference leads to a fatal error while anticipating Anotsu's final attack. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Hyakurin'''|\u767e\u7433|Hyakurin}} {{anime voices|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]] (2008 anime), [[Marika Hayashi]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n: A female [[assassination|assassin]] and a [[lieutenant]] in the Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin was the wife of an abusive samurai, Hayakawa Kak\u014dsai Genkei, who was obsessed with trying to gain fame by training Matsuhiko, their sickly son, to become a strong swordsman. He killed Matsuhiko's unnamed twin sister shortly after her birth because he saw no worth in raising a girl and then killed Matsuhiko foer failing to meet his expectations. She later kills her husband to avenge the death of her children and is then arrested and sentenced to death. Her case came to the attention of Kagimura who subsequently recruited her into Mugai-ry\u016b. Hyakurin's most unusual physical trait is her blonde hair (concealed frequently under a wig), which she maintains by bleaching it with a strong chemical as a compulsive desire to remove bloodstains from it. While her skills with a sword are unremarkable, she has an extensive knowledge of poisons. This knowledge carries over into her choice of weaponry, a collapsible wrist mounted crossbow with poisoned bolts named Burafuma (Little Steps). The crossbow also possesses two blades such that when the weapon is collapsed, Hyakurin can use it to stab her opponents. After volume 11, Beasts, her skills are impeded after being tortured and having her arm smashed. She later becomes pregnant and ends up \"retired\" from the Mugai-ry\u016b because of a deal between Habaki and Giichi when Giichi earns his freedom.  She has no desire to keep the child because she believes she will be reminded of Shinriji's death and the faces of the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b men who raped her.  She first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shira'''|\u5c38\u826f|Shira}} {{anime voices|[[Shin-ichiro Miki]] (2008 anime), [[T\u014dru Nara]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A cold-blooded killer in the Mugai-ry\u016b. He's responsible for the death of Magatsu Taito's close friend, O-Ren. Shira's a sadistic psychopath who derives sexual pleasure in the torture and murder of his victims, particularly young women. After an attempt to ambush Anotsu goes horribly wrong and he tries to take it out on his attackers. He uses the saw-blade side of his sword to hack of some of their limbs, and then tries to rape a prostitute that was with them while cutting her up at the same time. Rin tries to stop him but is slapped away, Manji arrives and manages to take off Shira's hand before he runs off. Following this incident he cuts some flesh from his injured arm, and sharpens the bones into spikes. His hair turns stark white due to the trauma he caused himself. He develops an obsession with revenge on Manji which leads to him betraying his Mugai-ry\u016b comrades, causing the death of Shinriji and capture of Hyakurin. Later, his quest for revenge against Manji leads to a battle with Magatsu Taito, who was traveling with Manji specifically so he could find Shira. This battle further cripples him with the loss of his remaining hand. Recently he's been shown to be imprisoned in the same prison Manji is currently being held in, and has been set parameters/lists as to whom he shall face before being allowed to fight Manji (this list includes Magatsu). He also states that he has since lost one eye, and has a new \"weapon\" of sorts. No longer being able to feel pain, he steals Manji's missing left arm and attaches to his own, gaining bloodworms.  He is eventually killed by Manji after an intense battle due to overextending his immortality by getting cut up too much while his bloodworms were weakened by the winter cold and his body is left to be eaten by dogs. However, before he finally succumbs to the pack of dogs, he tells Renzo not to become pure evil like himself, not to listen to men like him anymore and to give up his pursuit of Manji's death; saying that Renzo isn't cut out for a life of vengeance. He uses a ninja-to sword, with a saw edge on one side of the blade. He usually uses the regular side to immobilize opponents by cutting off their legs, and then uses the saw-blade to cut off other parts of the body and cause maximum pain. This sword is named \"Hotosogi\" or woman shadow eraser. However, there is a second meaning for \"Hotosogi\" which also fits Shira's sadistic nature; when the kanji for woman and shadow are used together they become vagina. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 2 and is first named in ''Dark Shadows'' part 3.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Giichi'''|\u507d\u4e00|Giichi<!--It's Gi-ichi but written as \"Giichi\"-->}} {{anime voices|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] (2008 anime), Hiroshi Shirokuma (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[David Vincent (actor)|David Vincent]]}}\n: The strongest Mugai-ry\u016b killer, aside from the immortality enhanced Shira. Though little is initially known about his past or reasons for being sentenced to death, it is eventually revealed that after Giichi's wife died, he devoted himself to raising their sickly son, Tojiro.  However, as a poor shipwright, the cost of doctors, medicine, and interest forced Giichi to resort to crime until he was caught and recruited by Habaki.  Giichi is one of the most skilled fighters in the series, having killed a total of 59 Itt\u014d-ry\u016b swordsmen on his own. Of the Mugai-ry\u016b, he is the only member who manages to garner enough kills to earn his freedom; however, this achievement means little to him when he learns at the same time that Tojiro has suddenly died. He works closely with Kagimura Habaki and cares for the other Mugai-ry\u016b, attempting to buy Hyakurin's freedom as well, unsuccessfully.  He disappears when Habaki dissolves the Mugai-ry\u016b and is later found living in among the [[burakumin]] by Rin and Hyakurin, where he provides Rin with information concerning Manji's whereabouts.  Now a broken man, he deliberately distances himself from Hyakurin to keep her from suffering any more pain and is aware of her pregnancy - when she tries to kill her baby, he stops her and persuades her to carry the child to term and allow him to raise the baby after it is born. He eventually agrees to work briefly for Habaki once again against the Itto-ryu; he and Hyakurin attack Abayama Sosuke, with Giichi taking on Abayama himself in a bloody battle that ends with Giichi defeating Abayama at the cost of an ear. He uses a unique weapon which resembles an oversized bladed handcuff attached to a length of chain. The weapon, Kanetsura's Mito-no-Kami (Guardian of the Three Paths), was adapted from a thresher or similar farming implement, and allows him to sever or entangle limbs, necks and weapons from a distance. It is hard to block as the handcuff like action will wrap it around what it hits, but it is broken by Manji in Volume 14: Last Blood. Manji gave Giichi one of his own weapons, two curved blades attached by a chain, that Giichi now uses though he claims he is only borrowing it. Giichi's first appearance is in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Shinriji'''|\u771f\u7406\u8def|Shinriji}} {{anime voices|[[Y\u016bya Uchida (voice actor)|Yuya Uchida]] (2008 anime), Chikahiro Kobayashi (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n: A bumbling Mugai-ry\u016b swordsman. He was apparently a pickpocket and thief prior to joining the Mugai-ry\u016b. After attending a sword school, he worked for a silk merchant. Disgruntled by his low wages, he stole money from the merchant and left. Shinriji intentionally stole 1 ryo less than 10 ryo to avoid the death penalty. Unfortunately for him, they added the money he earned legitimately to the total. He worked most closely with Hyakurin and developed a crush on her, viewing her as a surrogate mother, her blonde hair reminding him of his foreign mother. While he's not highly skilled with a sword, he does have a firm grasp of dimensions as noted by Kinuka, and is implied by Kagimura to have much potential. He first appears in ''Dark Shadows'' part 1, and is later killed by Kinuka, but not before taking out four Itt\u014d-ry\u016b.  As he dies, he positions himself to point south-east (archaically called ''tatsumi'') in order to tell Giichi that Hyakurin has been taken to the ''Tatsumi'' district of Edo.  As a sign of respect, Hyakurin cuts her hair and places the tied locks on his gravesite.\n\n* {{nihongo|'''Makoto'''|\u771f\u7434|Makoto}} {{anime voices|[[Wataru Hatano]]|Jason Wishnov}}\n: A former male prostitute, Makoto was recruited to be the group's mole within the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. During his time in the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, he served as a page for the senior members often carrying letters and taking care of their weapons during meetings. He was a key player in the massacre which occurred during a feast meant to celebrate the official union of Itt\u014d-ry\u016b with Banshu, slipping poison into the Itt\u014d-ry\u016b's food.

After Mouzen's failure, Burando is assigned by Habaki to succeed at achieving immortality; though he does not do so within the time limit, Habaki allows Burando to continue since Burando has produced results. He zealously conducts experiments on Manji and other prisoners to replicate Manji's immortality with utmost understanding of the human anatomy. However, his obsession results in the brutal deaths of a large number of prisoners and he is driven mad by his obsession. After Rin rescues Manji, Burando escapes from the prison and repents as he slowly finds the families of the men he killed and hopes to aid them anonymously with his medical knowledge.\n*{{nihongo|'''Mouzen'''|\u5b5f\u81b3}}: An experienced doctor brought in alongside Burando Ayame by Habaki to conduct experiments on Manji to achieve immortality.

Habaki's family appears to be unaware of her, while Ryo cares deeply for both Sakutaro and Shima, Habaki's son and wife respectively.  Though Habaki arranges for her to become a ward of one of his allies, Ryo would rather die helping him by taking the vacant seat among the member of the Rokki-dan's Onihana division.  However, despite her regular training, her skills as a sword fighter are mediocre in comparison to the considerably more powerful combatants existing in the series, a fact she is aware of.  After returning as the only survivor of a mission in which she kills Koji Kashin, Habaki releases her from the Rokki-dan.  Desperate to follow her father, Magatsu finds her feverish and collapsed on the ground and reluctantly takes her with him as he attempts to catch up to Anotsu, during which Ryo makes the request for Magatsu to take her as a pupil.

Is killed by Amon, minor member of the Itto-ryu.\n*{{nihongo|'''Meguro'''|\u76ee\u9ed2}}: An attractive [[Kunoichi]] working for Kagimura as a member of the Rokki-dan. She is also a student of Master Sori, whom she is infatuated with, and becomes friends with Rin, who works as Sori's housekeeper. Her attempts to have him accept her affections are usually misconstrued and her artistic style and poor cooking ability do little to impress Sori, who appears to be oblivious.  Her real name is {{nihongo|''Koto''|\u3053\u3068}}.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tanpopo'''|\u305f\u3093\u307d\u307d}}: A Kunoichi of the Rokki-dan alongside Meguro.

After Manji killed his brother \"Johnny\", Hishiyasu sought revenge by kidnapping Manji's sister, Machi, to use her as bait. When Manji would not submit to a duel, and offered only to fight barehanded, Hishiyasu lets Machi go only to kill her immediately after. He has two pronged swords that have the word \"ACID\" on the [[tsuba]]. After the death of his sister, Manji is able to accept his fate and proceeds to kill the entire ronin gang, starting with Shido Hishiyasu. His first appearance and death both occur in ''Criminal''. Like Johnny, he has his name based on a member of Sex Pistols, bassist [[Sid Vicious]] (being Shido's name an almost literal romanization).\n*{{nihongo|'''Sori'''|\u5b97\u7406}} {{anime voices|[[Tomokazu Seki]] (2019 anime)<ref name=\"2019-cast-3\"/>}}\n: A high-ranking spy and ninja obsessed with art, driven into political intrigue in order to gain access to European art, which is contraband in that period. Master S\u014dri has a daughter named Tatsu and is a childhood friend of the Asano clan. Rin goes to him hoping he will be another sword against Itt\u014d-ry\u016b. He refuses to offer any help at first but is soon able to provide Rin with thirty ry\u014d. He later assists Manji after he is injured, and informs him about who is behind the Mugai-ry\u016b. Also hires Magatsu to watch over his daughter while he is away painting, and is later revealed that may have greater interest in Magatsu (to which Manji notes after his conversation with Magatsu in volume 12, Autumn Frost). He first appears in Genius part 1.\n*{{nihongo|'''Tatsu'''|\u8fb0}}: Known also as Tatsub\u014d; Sori's daughter, a practical young woman who does not appear to be aware of most of her father's activities beyond sword fighting and is a childhood friend of Rin. She ends up taking care of Manji after he is severely injured by the Itto-Ryu while attempting to obtain a ''tsuko tegata'' to enter Kaga and follow Rin. She appears to be capable of taking care of her family's house, since Magatsu, who was hired by Sori to protect Tatsu, leaves with Manji in search of Shira even though Sori is still off painting.  By the time Rin and Manji return, Tatsu has apparently gotten married to a local merchant's son, while Rin winds up helping Sori out with household tasks.  She returns to her father's home after divorcing her husband because she had become fed up with how overbearing he was to her just as Rin and Manji are about to depart in search of Anotsu again.\n* {{nihongo|'''Renzo Kawakami'''|\u5ddd\u4e0a \u932c\u9020|Kawakami Renz\u014d}}: Son of Itto-Ryu member Araya Kawakami. Rin befriends him, only to discover his father was the one responsible for raping and then killing her mother.  She and Manji orchestrate a scene where it appears that Manji murdered Araya in cold blood and then was killed by Renzo so Renzo would not seek revenge like Rin.  After being orphaned by Manji, he is now Shira's hand both literally and figuratively.\n*{{nihongo|'''Shima Habaki'''|\u5410 \u5fd7\u6469|''Habaki Shima''}} {{nihongo|'''Sakutaro'''|\u5410 \u7d22\u592a\u90ce|''Habaki Sakutar\u014d''}}: The strong willed, proud and loyal wife of Habaki and his young son. When Habaki is condemned by his successor Hanabusa after failing to capture the Itto-ryu and producing results for the immortality experiment, Shima and Sakutaro are arrested in order to secure Habaki's cooperation.  When Ryo attempts to save them, Shima astutely realizes that Ryo is Habaki's illegitimate daughter.  To atone for her husband's perceived failure, Shima deliberately kills both their son and herself before Hanabusa and Habaki to ensure that Habaki will no longer have any obstacles to destroy the Itto-ryu.  Their deaths have a devastating impact on Habaki who cares greatly for both of them.\n*{{nihongo|'''Ugen Hanabusa'''|\u82f1\u4e8e\u5f66|''Hanabusa Ugen''}}: Previously subordinate to Habaki, Hanabusa becomes Habaki's successor when Habaki is forced to accept that he has failed to contain the Itto-ryu and produce successful results from the Immortality Experiment.  Though Hanabusa is cunning, his ability to scheme his way into ensuring Habaki's downfall by negotiating with the Itto-ryu fails largely due to Hanabusa's inability to match Habaki's ruthless determination and being unable to truly anticipate the movements of Anotsu and the Itto-ryu.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Blade of the Immortal}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Blade of the Immortal]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Blade_of_the_Immortal_characters"}

Wright Mills]] in his 1959 book ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]'' to describe the type of insight offered by the discipline of [[sociology]]. The term is used in introductory [[textbook]]s in sociology to explain the nature of sociology and its relevance in daily life.<ref name=\"sociological-imagination-mills\" />\n\n==Definitions==\nWell punctually if you think about it its always here Sociologists differ in their understanding of the concept, but the range suggests several important commonalities. Together, they conclude that C. Wright Mills defined sociological imagination as \"the awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society\".<ref name=\"sociological-imagination-mills\">Mills, C. Wright. The Sociological Imagination (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959), 5, 7. Print</ref>\n\nSociological imagination is an outlook on life that tries to break away from the monotony of day to day life. Specifically, the sociological imagination involves an individual developing a deep understanding of how their biography is a result of historical process and occurs within a larger social context.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: Sociological imagination: The application of imaginative thought to the asking and answering of sociological questions. Someone using the sociological imagination \"thinks himself away\" from the familiar routines of daily life.<ref name=\":0\">Giddens, Anthony (2006). Sociology (fifth edition). Cambridge: Polity</ref>\n\nAnother way of describing sociological imagination is the understanding that social outcomes are based on what we do. To expand on that definition, it is understanding that some things in society may lead to a certain outcome.The factors mentioned are examples like norms and motives, the social context, and the social action which all affects others. The things we do are shaped by: the situation we are in, the values we have, and the way people around us act. These devices are examined to find how they all relate to one outcome. Sociological imagination can also be considered as a quality of mind that understands the interplay of the individual and society.\n\nThings that shape these outcomes include (but are not limited to): [[social norms]], what people want to gain from their actions (their [[Motivation|motives]]), and the social context in which they live (e.g. country, time period, people with whom they associate).\n\nSociological imagination is the capacity to shift from one perspective to another. To have a sociological imagination, a person must be able to pull away from the situation and think from an alternative point of view. It requires us to \"think ourselves away from our daily routines and look at them anew\". To acquire knowledge, it is important to break free from the immediacy of personal circumstances and put things into a wider context, rather than following a routine.\n\nMills believed in the power of the sociological imagination to connect \"personal troubles to public issues\".\n\nThere is an urge to know the historical and [[Social meaning-making|sociological meaning]] of the singular individual in society, particularly within their time period. To do this one may use the sociological imagination to better understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner self and external career of a variety of individuals.<ref name=\"sociological-imagination-mills\"/> The sociological imagination can be seen practiced if one reflects on their history for all past events have led up to the present, mostly following the same pattern. Mills argued that history is an important element in sociological imagination. These different historical events have shaped modern society as a whole and each individual within it. It allows a person to see where their life is at compared to others, based on past experiences. Mills argues that one can only truly understand themselves if they can truly understand their circumstances.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nuesse|first=C. J.|last2=Mills|first2=C.

Goldsen, \"Mills and the Profession of Sociology,\" in The New Sociology, ed. Irving Lewis Horowitz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964), 5. Print.</ref> He eventually became disappointed with his profession of sociology because he felt it was abandoning its responsibilities, which he criticized in his book ''The Sociological Imagination''. In some introductory sociology classes the sociological imagination is brought up, along with Mills and how he characterized the sociological imagination as a critical quality of mind that would help men and women \"to use information and to develop reason in order to achieve lucid summations of what is going on in the world and of what may be happening within themselves\".<ref>Keen, Mike Forrest. Stalking the Sociological Imagination: J. Edgar Hoover's FBI Surveillance of American Sociology. Westport, Conn: Greenwood, 1999. Print.</ref>\n\n==Real life application==\n===Without the use of social imagination===\nSociological imagination is to place oneself outside of everyday routines and to be able to view one's actions or life from third party perspective. It allows one to make more self-aware decisions rather than be swayed by social norms or factors that may otherwise dictate actions. Lack of sociological imagination can render people very apathetic. [[Apathy]] is a \"spiritual condition\" which may be the cause of many of their problems. These problems being lack of indignation in scenarios dealing with moral horror, accepting atrocities performed by their leaders (political or familiar), and lacking the ability to react morally to the actions and decisions of their leaders. The [[Holocaust]] is a classical example of what happens when a society renders itself to the power of a leader and doesn't use sociological imagination. The Holocaust was based on the principle of absolute power in a dictatorship where society fell victim to apathy and willingly looked away from the horrors they committed. They willfully accepted the decisions taken by [[Adolf Hitler]] and carried out the orders because they had lost self-awareness and moral code, then adopting the new social [[moral code]]. In doing this they lost the ability to morally react to Hitler's command and in turn slaughtered more than 6,000,000 Jews, other minorities, and disabled persons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia|last=Laqueur|first=Walter|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|location=New Haven, Connecticut}}</ref>\n\nThe sociological imagination encompasses sociological concepts and information of the world as a society.<ref name=lumen>{{citation |title=The Sociological Imagination |work=lumen Sociology |publisher=College of the Crowns }}</ref> How we interpret it and how we see it. One must understand the life of an individual and the life of a society simultaneously, in order to make a connection. Thus, making comparison to situations in one's life to the situations in the real world society.\n\nThis can help make a difference in how we view the world and how we get past specific mental obstacles in order to relate to people, events, and situations that are usually not in our control. This causes us to put ourselves in other people's shoes, thus, solve some of our problems and in turn, personally benefiting ourselves.\n\nAll of this, comes with the simple differing of our personal situations and societal situations, ones that affect an entire community. In turn, figuring out how to use the daily struggles and things in society to come out making better personal choices and benefiting ourselves, making the world a better place. Which makes life easier, less stressful, and overall, putting us in situations that benefit us and make us happy and in turn doing the right thing as an individual.<ref name=lumen /><ref>{{citation |last1=Matresse |first1=Cathy |title=Self Check: The Sociological Imagination |publisher=lumen Sociology }}</ref>\n\n==Sociological perspective==\n[[Peter L. Berger]] coined the related term \"sociological perspective\". He stated that the sociological perspective was seeing \"the general in the particular,\" and that it helped sociologists realize general patterns in the behavior of specific individuals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> One can think of the sociological perspective as one's own personal choice and how society plays a role in shaping individuals' lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, \"Sociology\", Seventh Canadian Edition, Pearson Canada</ref>\n\n==Uses in films==\nThe advantages of using popular films to enhance students' comprehension of sociological topics is widely recognized. Those who teach courses in social problems report using films to teach about war, to aid students in adopting a global perspective, and to confront issues of race relations. There are benefits of using film as part of a multimedia approach to teaching courses in popular culture. It provides students of medical sociology with case studies for hands-on observational experiences. It acknowledges the value of films as historical documentation of changes in cultural ideas, materials, and institutions.\n\nFeature films are used in introductory sociology courses to demonstrate the current relevance of sociological thinking and to show how the sociological imagination helps people make sense of their social world. The underlying assumption is that the sociological imagination is best developed and exercised in the introductory class by linking new materials in the context of [[conflict theory]] and functionalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tipton|first=Dana Bickford|last2=Tiemann|first2=Kathleen A.|date=April 1993|title=Using the Feature Film to Facilitate Sociological Thinking|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=187|doi=10.2307/1318642|issn=0092-055X|jstor=1318642}}</ref>\n\nThe sociological imagination as used in the determining and analysis of feature films is somewhat important to the average sociological standpoint, but in channeling the sociological imagination viewpoint, can become a helpful tool in learning about sociological perspectives, thus gaing it in the process. Both sociology and film making really go hand in hand, because of the message and theme that is being portrayed and the viewers reaction because of this thus, creating room for debate in terms of interpretation.\n\nFor example, creating a film that introduces character from four different angles and situations in life, drawing upon social, psychological, and moral standards of life to bring together one, central ideal that echoes through the overall meaning and reasoning behind the actions taken by individuals, as well as the overall outcome of the story in general.\n\nThrough the viewing, discussions take place amongst the individuals that view the film with intent on entertainment satisfaction or even the notion to truly understand or interpret the films theme. IN this discussion, plot points are made, conclusions are drawn upon and many minor problems/situations in modern society are indeed fixed, if at the least made into a compromise for the benefit of certain groups, situations, and processes that are ongoing in today's world. So, this creates further sociological imagination to find beneficial and efficient ways to help people, determine things morally permissible or not, and even giving way to new ideas and ways to network people through correlating ideologies and aspects, which can change or even add sociological perspective to someone's state of mind.<ref name=\"Teaching Sociology\">{{cite journal |last1=Prendergast |first1=Christopher |title=Cinema Sociology: Cultivating the Sociological Imagination through Popular Film. |journal=Teaching Sociology |date=October 1986 |publisher=American Sociological Association |volume=14  |number=4 |pages=243\u2013248 |jstor=1318381 |doi=10.2307/1318381 }}</ref>\n\n== Creation ==\nMills created tips to help conduct valid and reliable sociological study using sociological imagination:\n# Be a good craftsman: Avoid any rigid set of procedures. Above all, seek to develop and to use the sociological imagination. Avoid the fetishism of method and technique. Urge the rehabilitation of the unpretentious intellectual craftsman, and try to become such a craftsman yourself. Let every man be his own methodologist; let every man be his own theorist; let theory and method again become part of the practice of a craft. Stand for the primacy of the individual scholar; stand opposed to the ascendancy of research teams of technicians. Be one mind that is on its own confronting the problems of man and society.\n# Avoid the Byzantine oddity of associated and disassociated Concepts, the mannerism of verbiage. Urge upon yourself and upon others the simplicity of clear statement. Use more elaborated terms only when you believe firmly that their use enlarges the scope of your sensibilities, the precision of your references, the depth of your reasoning. Avoid using unintelligibility as a means of evading the making of judgments upon society\u2014and as a means of escaping your readers' judgments upon your own work.\n# Make any trans-historical constructions you think your work requires; also delve into sub-historical minutiae. Make up quite formal theory and build models as well as you can. Examine in detail little facts and their relations, and big unique events as well. But do not be fanatic: relate all such work, continuously and closely, to the level of historical reality. Do not assume that somebody else will do this for you, sometime, somewhere. Take as your task the defining of this reality; formulate your problems in its terms; on its level try to solve these problems and thus resolve the issues and the troubles they incorporate. And never write more than three pages without at least having in mind a solid example.\n# Do not study merely one small milieu after another; study the social structures in which milieux are organized. In terms of these studies of larger structures, select the milieux you need to study in detail, and study them in such a way as to understand the interplay of milieux with structure. Proceed in a similar way in so far as the span of time is concerned. Do not be merely a journalist, however a precise one. Know that journalism can be a great intellectual endeavor, but know also that yours is greater! So do not merely report minute researches into static knife-edge moments, or very short-term runs of time. Take as your time\u2014span the course of human history, and locate within it the weeks, years, epochs you examine.\n# Realize that your aim is a fully comparative understanding of the social structures that have appeared and that do now exist in world history. Realize that to carry it out you must avoid the arbitrary specialization of prevailing academic departments. Specialize your work variously, according to topic, and above all according to significant problem. In formulating and in trying to solve these problems, do not hesitate, indeed seek, continually and imaginatively, to draw upon the perspectives and materials, the ideas and methods, of any and all sensible studies of man and society. They are your studies; they are part of what you are a part of; do not let them be taken from you by those who would close them off by weird jargon and pretensions of expertise.\n# Always keep your eyes open to the image of man\u2014the generic notion of his human nature\u2014which by your work you are assuming and implying; and also to the image of history\u2014your notion of how history is being made. In a word, continually work out and revise your views of the problems of history, the problems of biography, and the problems of social structure in which biography and history intersect. Keep your eyes open to the varieties of individuality, and to the modes of epochal change. Use what you see and what you imagine, as the clues to your study of the human variety.\n# Know that you inherit and are carrying on the tradition of classic social analysis; so try to understand man not as an isolated fragment, not as an intelligible field or system in and of itself. Try to understand men and women as historical and social actors, and the ways in which the variety of men and women are intricately selected and intricately formed by the variety of human societies. Before you are through with any piece of work, no matter how indirectly on occasion, orient it to the central and continuing task of understanding the structure and the drift, the shaping and the meanings, of your own period, the terrible and magnificent world of human society in the second half of the twentieth century.\n# Do not allow public issues as they are officially formulated, or troubles as they are privately felt, to determine the problems that you take up for study. Above all, do not give up your moral and political autonomy by accepting in somebody else's terms the illiberal practicality of the bureaucratic ethos or the liberal practicality of the moral scatter. Know that many personal troubles cannot be solved merely as troubles, but must be understood in terms of public issues\u2014and in terms of the problems of history-making. Know that the human meaning of public issues must be revealed by relating them to personal troubles\u2014and to the problems of the individual life. Know that the problems of social science, when adequately formulated, must include both troubles and issues, both biography and history, and the range of their intricate relations. Within that range the life of the individual and the making of societies occur; and within that range the sociological imagination has its chance to make a difference in the quality of human life in our time.<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Sociological Imagination\n | last = Mills\n | first = C.Wright\n | publisher = Prentice Hall\n | year = 1959\n | location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.\n }}</ref>\n\n== Other theories ==\n[[Herbert Blumer]], in his work \"Symbolic interactionism\": Perspective and method, develops the idea of a non-standard look at the world around us; helping social scientists to understand and analyze the study area.\n\n<blockquote>\"One can see the empirical world only through some scheme or image of it. The entire act of scientific study is oriented and shaped by the underlying picture of the empirical world that is used. This picture sets the selection and formulation of problems, the determination of what are data, the means to be used in getting the data, the kinds of relations sought between data, and the forms in which propositions are cast. In view of this fundamental and pervasive effect wielded on the entire act of scientific inquiry by the initiating picture of the empirical world, it is ridiculous to ignore this picture. The underlying picture of the world is always capable of identification in the form of a set of premises. These premises are constituted by the nature given either explicitly or implicitly to the key objects that comprise the picture. The unavoidable task of genuine methodological treatment is to identify and assess these premises\".<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = Symbolic Interaction: Perspective and Method\n | last = Blumer\n | first = Herbert\n | publisher = University of California Pres\n | year = 1969\n | pages = 24\u201325\n }}</ref></blockquote>\n[[Howard S. Becker]], being a disciple of Blumer, continued to develop his idea of a particular look at the objects under study, and in 1998 wrote a book ''Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about Your Research While You're Doing It'' where he gives a list of recommendations that may be useful in conducting sociological research. His main idea is to create a comprehensive picture of the object being studied, phenomenon or social group. To this end, he proposes to pay particular attention on statistical and historical knowledge before the conducting research, use critical thinking, trying to create a universal picture of the world, to make the result of the research understandable and acceptable for everyone.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about Your Research While You're Doing It\n| last = Becker\n| first = Howard\n| publisher = University of Chicago Press\n| year = 1998\n| pages = 21\u201396\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n*[[Imaginary (sociology)]]\n*[[Sociological theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.sociological-imagination.org/ Sociological-Imagination.ORG].

Wright Mills]] in his 1959 book ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]'' to describe the type of insight offered by the discipline of [[sociology]]. The term is used in introductory [[textbook]]s in sociology to explain the nature of sociology and its relevance in daily life.<ref name=\"sociological-imagination-mills\" />\n\n==Definitions==\nWell punctually if you think about it its always here Sociologists differ in their understanding of the concept, but the range suggests several important commonalities. Together, they conclude that C. Wright Mills defined sociological imagination as \"the awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society\".<ref name=\"sociological-imagination-mills\">Mills, C. Wright. The Sociological Imagination (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959), 5, 7. Print</ref>\n\nSociological imagination is an outlook on life that tries to break away from the monotony of day to day life. Specifically, the sociological imagination involves an individual developing a deep understanding of how their biography is a result of historical process and occurs within a larger social context.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: Sociological imagination: The application of imaginative thought to the asking and answering of sociological questions. Someone using the sociological imagination \"thinks himself away\" from the familiar routines of daily life.<ref name=\":0\">Giddens, Anthony (2006). Sociology (fifth edition). Cambridge: Polity</ref>\n\nAnother way of describing sociological imagination is the understanding that social outcomes are based on what we do. To expand on that definition, it is understanding that some things in society may lead to a certain outcome.The factors mentioned are examples like norms and motives, the social context, and the social action which all affects others. The things we do are shaped by: the situation we are in, the values we have, and the way people around us act. These devices are examined to find how they all relate to one outcome. Sociological imagination can also be considered as a quality of mind that understands the interplay of the individual and society.\n\nThings that shape these outcomes include (but are not limited to): [[social norms]], what people want to gain from their actions (their [[Motivation|motives]]), and the social context in which they live (e.g. country, time period, people with whom they associate).\n\nSociological imagination is the capacity to shift from one perspective to another. To have a sociological imagination, a person must be able to pull away from the situation and think from an alternative point of view. It requires us to \"think ourselves away from our daily routines and look at them anew\". To acquire knowledge, it is important to break free from the immediacy of personal circumstances and put things into a wider context, rather than following a routine.\n\nMills believed in the power of the sociological imagination to connect \"personal troubles to public issues\".\n\nThere is an urge to know the historical and [[Social meaning-making|sociological meaning]] of the singular individual in society, particularly within their time period. To do this one may use the sociological imagination to better understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner self and external career of a variety of individuals.<ref name=\"sociological-imagination-mills\"/> The sociological imagination can be seen practiced if one reflects on their history for all past events have led up to the present, mostly following the same pattern. Mills argued that history is an important element in sociological imagination. These different historical events have shaped modern society as a whole and each individual within it. It allows a person to see where their life is at compared to others, based on past experiences. Mills argues that one can only truly understand themselves if they can truly understand their circumstances.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nuesse|first=C. J.|last2=Mills|first2=C.

Goldsen, \"Mills and the Profession of Sociology,\" in The New Sociology, ed. Irving Lewis Horowitz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964), 5. Print.</ref> He eventually became disappointed with his profession of sociology because he felt it was abandoning its responsibilities, which he criticized in his book ''The Sociological Imagination''. In some introductory sociology classes the sociological imagination is brought up, along with Mills and how he characterized the sociological imagination as a critical quality of mind that would help men and women \"to use information and to develop reason in order to achieve lucid summations of what is going on in the world and of what may be happening within themselves\".<ref>Keen, Mike Forrest. Stalking the Sociological Imagination: J. Edgar Hoover's FBI Surveillance of American Sociology. Westport, Conn: Greenwood, 1999. Print.</ref>\n\n==Real life application==\n===Without the use of social imagination===\nSociological imagination is to place oneself outside of everyday routines and to be able to view one's actions or life from third party perspective. It allows one to make more self-aware decisions rather than be swayed by social norms or factors that may otherwise dictate actions. Lack of sociological imagination can render people very apathetic. [[Apathy]] is a \"spiritual condition\" which may be the cause of many of their problems. These problems being lack of indignation in scenarios dealing with moral horror, accepting atrocities performed by their leaders (political or familiar), and lacking the ability to react morally to the actions and decisions of their leaders. The [[Holocaust]] is a classical example of what happens when a society renders itself to the power of a leader and doesn't use sociological imagination. The Holocaust was based on the principle of absolute power in a dictatorship where society fell victim to apathy and willingly looked away from the horrors they committed. They willfully accepted the decisions taken by [[Adolf Hitler]] and carried out the orders because they had lost self-awareness and moral code, then adopting the new social [[moral code]]. In doing this they lost the ability to morally react to Hitler's command and in turn slaughtered more than 6,000,000 Jews, other minorities, and disabled persons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia|last=Laqueur|first=Walter|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|location=New Haven, Connecticut}}</ref>\n\nThe sociological imagination encompasses sociological concepts and information of the world as a society.<ref name=lumen>{{citation |title=The Sociological Imagination |work=lumen Sociology |publisher=College of the Crowns }}</ref> How we interpret it and how we see it. One must understand the life of an individual and the life of a society simultaneously, in order to make a connection. Thus, making comparison to situations in one's life to the situations in the real world society.\n\nThis can help make a difference in how we view the world and how we get past specific mental obstacles in order to relate to people, events, and situations that are usually not in our control. This causes us to put ourselves in other people's shoes, thus, solve some of our problems and in turn, personally benefiting ourselves.\n\nAll of this, comes with the simple differing of our personal situations and societal situations, ones that affect an entire community. In turn, figuring out how to use the daily struggles and things in society to come out making better personal choices and benefiting ourselves, making the world a better place. Which makes life easier, less stressful, and overall, putting us in situations that benefit us and make us happy and in turn doing the right thing as an individual.<ref name=lumen /><ref>{{citation |last1=Matresse |first1=Cathy |title=Self Check: The Sociological Imagination |publisher=lumen Sociology }}</ref>\n\n==Sociological perspective==\n[[Peter L. Berger]] coined the related term \"sociological perspective\". He stated that the sociological perspective was seeing \"the general in the particular,\" and that it helped sociologists realize general patterns in the behavior of specific individuals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> One can think of the sociological perspective as one's own personal choice and how society plays a role in shaping individuals' lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, \"Sociology\", Seventh Canadian Edition, Pearson Canada</ref>\n\n==Uses in films==\nThe advantages of using popular films to enhance students' comprehension of sociological topics is widely recognized. Those who teach courses in social problems report using films to teach about war, to aid students in adopting a global perspective, and to confront issues of race relations. There are benefits of using film as part of a multimedia approach to teaching courses in popular culture. It provides students of medical sociology with case studies for hands-on observational experiences. It acknowledges the value of films as historical documentation of changes in cultural ideas, materials, and institutions.\n\nFeature films are used in introductory sociology courses to demonstrate the current relevance of sociological thinking and to show how the sociological imagination helps people make sense of their social world. The underlying assumption is that the sociological imagination is best developed and exercised in the introductory class by linking new materials in the context of [[conflict theory]] and functionalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tipton|first=Dana Bickford|last2=Tiemann|first2=Kathleen A.|date=April 1993|title=Using the Feature Film to Facilitate Sociological Thinking|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=187|doi=10.2307/1318642|issn=0092-055X|jstor=1318642}}</ref>\n\nThe sociological imagination as used in the determining and analysis of feature films is somewhat important to the average sociological standpoint, but in channeling the sociological imagination viewpoint, can become a helpful tool in learning about sociological perspectives, thus gaing it in the process. Both sociology and film making really go hand in hand, because of the message and theme that is being portrayed and the viewers reaction because of this thus, creating room for debate in terms of interpretation.\n\nFor example, creating a film that introduces character from four different angles and situations in life, drawing upon social, psychological, and moral standards of life to bring together one, central ideal that echoes through the overall meaning and reasoning behind the actions taken by individuals, as well as the overall outcome of the story in general.\n\nThrough the viewing, discussions take place amongst the individuals that view the film with intent on entertainment satisfaction or even the notion to truly understand or interpret the films theme. IN this discussion, plot points are made, conclusions are drawn upon and many minor problems/situations in modern society are indeed fixed, if at the least made into a compromise for the benefit of certain groups, situations, and processes that are ongoing in today's world. So, this creates further sociological imagination to find beneficial and efficient ways to help people, determine things morally permissible or not, and even giving way to new ideas and ways to network people through correlating ideologies and aspects, which can change or even add sociological perspective to someone's state of mind.<ref name=\"Teaching Sociology\">{{cite journal |last1=Prendergast |first1=Christopher |title=Cinema Sociology: Cultivating the Sociological Imagination through Popular Film. |journal=Teaching Sociology |date=October 1986 |publisher=American Sociological Association |volume=14  |number=4 |pages=243\u2013248 |jstor=1318381 |doi=10.2307/1318381 }}</ref>\n\n== Creation ==\nMills created tips to help conduct valid and reliable sociological study using sociological imagination:\n# Be a good craftsman: Avoid any rigid set of procedures. Above all, seek to develop and to use the sociological imagination. Avoid the fetishism of method and technique. Urge the rehabilitation of the unpretentious intellectual craftsman, and try to become such a craftsman yourself. Let every man be his own methodologist; let every man be his own theorist; let theory and method again become part of the practice of a craft. Stand for the primacy of the individual scholar; stand opposed to the ascendancy of research teams of technicians. Be one mind that is on its own confronting the problems of man and society.\n# Avoid the Byzantine oddity of associated and disassociated Concepts, the mannerism of verbiage. Urge upon yourself and upon others the simplicity of clear statement. Use more elaborated terms only when you believe firmly that their use enlarges the scope of your sensibilities, the precision of your references, the depth of your reasoning. Avoid using unintelligibility as a means of evading the making of judgments upon society\u2014and as a means of escaping your readers' judgments upon your own work.\n# Make any trans-historical constructions you think your work requires; also delve into sub-historical minutiae. Make up quite formal theory and build models as well as you can. Examine in detail little facts and their relations, and big unique events as well. But do not be fanatic: relate all such work, continuously and closely, to the level of historical reality. Do not assume that somebody else will do this for you, sometime, somewhere. Take as your task the defining of this reality; formulate your problems in its terms; on its level try to solve these problems and thus resolve the issues and the troubles they incorporate. And never write more than three pages without at least having in mind a solid example.\n# Do not study merely one small milieu after another; study the social structures in which milieux are organized. In terms of these studies of larger structures, select the milieux you need to study in detail, and study them in such a way as to understand the interplay of milieux with structure. Proceed in a similar way in so far as the span of time is concerned. Do not be merely a journalist, however a precise one. Know that journalism can be a great intellectual endeavor, but know also that yours is greater! So do not merely report minute researches into static knife-edge moments, or very short-term runs of time. Take as your time\u2014span the course of human history, and locate within it the weeks, years, epochs you examine.\n# Realize that your aim is a fully comparative understanding of the social structures that have appeared and that do now exist in world history. Realize that to carry it out you must avoid the arbitrary specialization of prevailing academic departments. Specialize your work variously, according to topic, and above all according to significant problem. In formulating and in trying to solve these problems, do not hesitate, indeed seek, continually and imaginatively, to draw upon the perspectives and materials, the ideas and methods, of any and all sensible studies of man and society. They are your studies; they are part of what you are a part of; do not let them be taken from you by those who would close them off by weird jargon and pretensions of expertise.\n# Always keep your eyes open to the image of man\u2014the generic notion of his human nature\u2014which by your work you are assuming and implying; and also to the image of history\u2014your notion of how history is being made. In a word, continually work out and revise your views of the problems of history, the problems of biography, and the problems of social structure in which biography and history intersect. Keep your eyes open to the varieties of individuality, and to the modes of epochal change. Use what you see and what you imagine, as the clues to your study of the human variety.\n# Know that you inherit and are carrying on the tradition of classic social analysis; so try to understand man not as an isolated fragment, not as an intelligible field or system in and of itself. Try to understand men and women as historical and social actors, and the ways in which the variety of men and women are intricately selected and intricately formed by the variety of human societies. Before you are through with any piece of work, no matter how indirectly on occasion, orient it to the central and continuing task of understanding the structure and the drift, the shaping and the meanings, of your own period, the terrible and magnificent world of human society in the second half of the twentieth century.\n# Do not allow public issues as they are officially formulated, or troubles as they are privately felt, to determine the problems that you take up for study. Above all, do not give up your moral and political autonomy by accepting in somebody else's terms the illiberal practicality of the bureaucratic ethos or the liberal practicality of the moral scatter. Know that many personal troubles cannot be solved merely as troubles, but must be understood in terms of public issues\u2014and in terms of the problems of history-making. Know that the human meaning of public issues must be revealed by relating them to personal troubles\u2014and to the problems of the individual life. Know that the problems of social science, when adequately formulated, must include both troubles and issues, both biography and history, and the range of their intricate relations. Within that range the life of the individual and the making of societies occur; and within that range the sociological imagination has its chance to make a difference in the quality of human life in our time.<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = The Sociological Imagination\n | last = Mills\n | first = C.Wright\n | publisher = Prentice Hall\n | year = 1959\n | location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.\n }}</ref>\n\n== Other theories ==\n[[Herbert Blumer]], in his work \"Symbolic interactionism\": Perspective and method, develops the idea of a non-standard look at the world around us; helping social scientists to understand and analyze the study area.\n\n<blockquote>\"One can see the empirical world only through some scheme or image of it. The entire act of scientific study is oriented and shaped by the underlying picture of the empirical world that is used. This picture sets the selection and formulation of problems, the determination of what are data, the means to be used in getting the data, the kinds of relations sought between data, and the forms in which propositions are cast. In view of this fundamental and pervasive effect wielded on the entire act of scientific inquiry by the initiating picture of the empirical world, it is ridiculous to ignore this picture. The underlying picture of the world is always capable of identification in the form of a set of premises. These premises are constituted by the nature given either explicitly or implicitly to the key objects that comprise the picture. The unavoidable task of genuine methodological treatment is to identify and assess these premises\".<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = Symbolic Interaction: Perspective and Method\n | last = Blumer\n | first = Herbert\n | publisher = University of California Pres\n | year = 1969\n | pages = 24\u201325\n }}</ref></blockquote>\n[[Howard S. Becker]], being a disciple of Blumer, continued to develop his idea of a particular look at the objects under study, and in 1998 wrote a book \"Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about Your Research While You're Doing It\" where he gives a list of recommendations that may be useful in conducting sociological research. His main idea is to create a comprehensive picture of the object being studied, phenomenon or social group. To this end, he proposes to pay particular attention on statistical and historical knowledge before the conducting research, use critical thinking, trying to create a universal picture of the world, to make the result of the research understandable and acceptable for everyone.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about Your Research While You're Doing It\n| last = Becker\n| first = Howard\n| publisher = University of Chicago Press\n| year = 1998\n| pages = 21\u201396\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n*[[Imaginary (sociology)]]\n*[[Sociological theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.sociological-imagination.org/ Sociological-Imagination.ORG].

{"title_page": "Vitaphone Varieties", "text_new": "{{About|the short film series|the Vitaphone process|Vitaphone}}\n'''Vitaphone Varieties''' was a series title (represented by a pennant logo on screen) for all of [[Warner Brothers]]' earliest [[short film]] \"talkies\" of the 1920s, initially done with the [[Vitaphone]] disc process before a switch to the sound-on-film format early in the 1930s. These were the first [[major film studio]]-backed [[sound film]]s, initially showcased with the 1926 synchronized scored features ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' and ''[[The Better 'Ole (1926 film)|The Better 'Ole]]''. Although independent producers like [[Lee de Forest]]\u2019s [[Phonofilm]] were successfully making sound film shorts as far back as 1922, they were very limited in their distribution and their audio was generally not as loud and clear in theaters as Vitaphone's. The success of the early Vitaphone shorts, initially filmed only in New York, helped launch the sound revolution in Hollywood.\n\n== Overview ==\nFeatured were many of the great [[vaudeville]] and musical performers of the 1920s. Classical musicians who dominated the early days of recorded sound were given their film debuts, along with the many future stars of radio's \"golden age\": [[Fred Allen]], [[Jack Benny]], [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]], [[Edgar Bergen]], just to name a few. Several top stars at Warner Bros. and other studios like [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[William Demarest]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Spencer Tracy]] also first appeared on screen in ten-minute dramatic and comedy sketches, as did a few silent stars making the transition like [[Blanche Sweet]].\n\n[[Al Jolson]] filmed ''[[A Plantation Act]]'' in August 1926, a full year before ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''. When Warner Brothers decided to promote the feature as Jolson's talkie debut, the earlier short was removed from circulation. Initially thought lost, it was restored, in part by the Vitaphone Project's efforts, for a laser disc set in the 1990s and later released on DVD with the feature.<ref>Liebman, Roy. ''Vitaphone Films \u2013 A Catalogue of the Features and Shorts''. 2003. McFarland & Company, p. 13</ref><ref name=\"picking\">{{cite web|url=http://www.picking.com/vitaphone22.html|title=The Vitaphone Project!|author=Patrick J. Picking|publisher=picking.com|accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, there was much fear that these little films (and the sound features that followed) would kill vaudeville, a fear that was justified for many individual performers. While there was always a chance that a stage performer could become a household name by appearing in these, his or her act could no longer be repeated on stage, town after town, once one filmed performance appeared in theaters across the country. A few comedy acts for Vitaphone even made light of this fact, particularly [[Georgie Price]]\u2019s still humorous today 1929 title, ''Don't Get Nervous''.\n\nAlthough the term \"Vitaphone Variety\" was still used with some Warner film shorts running under one reel (or 10 minutes) well into the 1950s, the trade periodicals marketed them under different logos after the 1931-32 season: Pepper Pots and Vitaphone ''Novelties'' (after 1936), while lengthier productions (running two reels or 20 minutes) morphed into the [[Broadway Brevities]]. By this time, the primary producer in charge was [[Samuel Sax]],<ref>Maltin, Leonard. ''The Great Movie Shorts''. 1972. Bonanza Books, p. 22</ref><ref>Koszarski, Richard. ''Hollywood On the Hudson: Film and Television in New York from Griffith to Sarnoff''. 2008. Rutgers University Press, p. 157</ref> who oversaw the majority of the New York filmed productions. Later titles completed in California in the forties and fifties sometimes recycled the \"Vitaphone Variety\" logo, but were usually marketed in the trade periodicals as either \"Hollywood Novelties\" or \"Warner Novelties\" and were mostly documentary rather than musical or comedy acts. Among this later group, two 1945-46 titles, ''Story of a Dog'' and ''Smart as a Fox'', were nominees for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] in the one-reel category.\n\n== Recent rediscovery ==\nThe impact that the earliest Vitaphone Varieties had on world cinema has been a frequent footnote in many film history books, but it was only in recent decades that books have bothered to analyze them in depth (among them, Roy Liebman's ''Vitaphone Films'' and  Edwin M. Bradley's ''The First Hollywood Sound Shorts, 1926\u20131931'').\n\nThe [[Vitaphone#The Vitaphone Project|Vitaphone Project]] only started in 1991 rounding up missing discs and matching them with films made before the studio switched to optical film recording. Three years later, MGM/UA issued the first group of them to laser disc, with Warner releasing the first significant number on DVD as part of a multi-disc edition of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''. Since then, the [[Warner Archive Collection]] has made more available in a series of sets, as well as re-releasing ''Don Juan'' with its accompanying shorts.\n\n== List of Vitaphone Varieties ==\nThe following list is not complete but fairly close. The 1926\u20131932 titles (the official \"Vitaphone Varieties\") are arranged by the Vitaphone title card numbers. They are then grouped by the year in which they were filmed, but not necessarily the same year they were released to theaters. If known, that date is listed right after the major credits (just the key director, if known, and the performers).

These were the first [[major film studio]]-backed [[sound film]]s, initially showcased with the 1926 synchronized scored features ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' and ''[[The Better 'Ole (1926 film)|The Better 'Ole]]''. Although independent producers like [[Lee de Forest]]\u2019s [[Phonofilm]] were successfully making sound film shorts as far back as 1922, they were very limited in their distribution and their audio was generally not as loud and clear in theaters as Vitaphone's. The success of the early Vitaphone shorts, initially filmed only in New York, helped launch the sound revolution in Hollywood.\n\n== Overview ==\nFeatured were many of the great [[vaudeville]] and musical performers of the 1920s. Classical musicians who dominated the early days of recorded sound were given their film debuts, along with the many future stars of radio\u2019s \"golden age\": [[Fred Allen]], [[Jack Benny]], [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]], [[Edgar Bergen]], just to name a few. Several top stars at Warner Bros. and other studios like [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[William Demarest]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Spencer Tracy]] also first appeared on screen in ten-minute dramatic and comedy sketches, as did a few silent stars making the transition like [[Blanche Sweet]].\n\n[[Al Jolson]] filmed ''[[A Plantation Act]]'' in August 1926, a full year before ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''. When Warner Brothers decided to promote the feature as Jolson\u2019s talkie debut, the earlier short was removed from circulation. Initially thought lost, it was restored, in part by the Vitaphone Project\u2019s efforts, for a laser disc set in the 1990s and later released on DVD with the feature.<ref>Liebman, Roy. ''Vitaphone Films \u2013 A Catalogue of the Features and Shorts''. 2003. McFarland & Company, p. 13</ref><ref name=\"picking\">{{cite web|url=http://www.picking.com/vitaphone22.html|title=The Vitaphone Project!|author=Patrick J. Picking|publisher=picking.com|accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, there was much fear that these little films (and the sound features that followed) would kill vaudeville, a fear that was justified for many individual performers. While there was always a chance that a stage performer could become a household name by appearing in these, his or her act could no longer be repeated on stage, town after town, once one filmed performance appeared in theaters across the country. A few comedy acts for Vitaphone even made light of this fact, particularly [[Georgie Price]]\u2019s still humorous today 1929 title, ''Don't Get Nervous''.\n\nAlthough the term \"Vitaphone Variety\" was still used with some Warner film shorts running under one reel (or 10 minutes) well into the 1950s, the trade periodicals marketed them under different logos after the 1931-32 season: Pepper Pots and Vitaphone ''Novelties'' (after 1936), while lengthier productions (running two reels or 20 minutes) morphed into the [[Broadway Brevities]]. By this time, the primary producer in charge was [[Samuel Sax]],<ref>Maltin, Leonard. ''The Great Movie Shorts''. 1972. Bonanza Books, p. 22</ref><ref>Koszarski, Richard. ''Hollywood On the Hudson: Film and Television in New York from Griffith to Sarnoff''. 2008. Rutgers University Press, p. 157</ref> who oversaw the majority of the New York filmed productions. Later titles completed in California in the forties and fifties sometimes recycled the \"Vitaphone Variety\" logo, but were usually marketed in the trade periodicals as either \"Hollywood Novelties\" or \"Warner Novelties\" and were mostly documentary rather than musical or comedy acts. Among this later group, two 1945-46 titles, ''Story of a Dog'' and ''Smart as a Fox'', were nominees for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] in the one-reel category.\n\n== Recent rediscovery ==\nThe impact that the earliest Vitaphone Varieties had on world cinema has been a frequent footnote in many film history books, but it was only in recent decades that books have bothered to analyze them in depth (among them, Roy Liebman's ''Vitaphone Films'' and  Edwin M. Bradley's ''The First Hollywood Sound Shorts, 1926\u20131931'').\n\nThe [[Vitaphone#The Vitaphone Project|Vitaphone Project]] only started in 1991 rounding up missing discs and matching them with films made before the studio switched to optical film recording. Three years later, MGM/UA issued the first group of them to laser disc, with Warner releasing the first significant number on DVD as part of a multi-disc edition of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''. Since then, the [[Warner Archive Collection]] has made more available in a series of sets, as well as re-releasing ''Don Juan'' with its accompanying shorts.\n\n== List of Vitaphone Varieties ==\nThe following list is not complete but fairly close. The 1926\u20131932 titles (the official \"Vitaphone Varieties\") are arranged by the Vitaphone title card numbers. They are then grouped by the year in which they were filmed, but not necessarily the same year they were released to theaters. If known, that date is listed right after the major credits (just the key director, if known, and the performers). Sometimes the date [[Film Daily]] reviewed it or the copyright date (\u00a9) is listed. DVD availability is also listed at the end of each line.<ref>Liebman, Roy.

The awards were originally known as the '''Society of West End Theatre Awards''', but they were renamed in honour of the British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1984.\n\nThe awards are given to individuals involved in [[West End theatre|West End]] productions and other leading [[West End theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial theatres]] based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards for film and television, and the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Tony Award]]s and [[France]]'s [[Moli\u00e8re Award]].\n\nSince its inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012-2016 at the [[Royal Opera House]], before moving to the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2017. Television coverage is broadcast in prime time on ITV, who acquired the rights from 2013 onwards with radio coverage by [[Magic Radio (London radio station)|Magic Radio]].\n\n==History==\nThe awards were first established in 1976 by the Society of London Theatre as the Society of West End Awards and were designed by artist Tom Merrifield. In 1984, British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] gave his consent for the awards to be renamed in his honour and they became known as the Laurence Olivier Awards.<ref>[https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/10-things-probably-didnt-know-olivier-awards/ \"10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About The Olivier Awards\"].

The awards were originally known as the '''Society of West End Theatre Awards''', but they were renamed in honour of the British actor [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1984.\n\nThe awards are given to individuals involved in [[West End theatre|West End]] productions and other leading [[West End theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial theatres]] based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards for film and television, and the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Tony Award]]s and [[France]]'s [[Moli\u00e8re Award]].\n\nSince its inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012-2016 at the [[Royal Opera House]], before moving to the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2017.

Ambient temperatures drive mosquito replication rates and transmission of WNV by affecting the peak season of mosquitoes and geographic variations. For example, increased temperatures can affect the rate of virus replication, speed up the virus evolution rate, and viral transmission efficiency. Furthermore, higher winter temperatures and warmer spring may lead to larger summer mosquito populations, increasing the risk for WNV. Similarly, rainfall may also drive mosquito replication rates and affect the seasonality and geographic variations of the virus. Studies show an association between heavy precipitation and higher incidence of reported WNV. Likewise, wind is another environmental factor that serves as a dispersal mechanism for mosquitoes.<ref name=\":11\" />\n[[File:Global distribution of West Nile virus-CDC.gif|thumb|Global Distribution of West Nile Virus CDC]]\nMosquitoes have extremely wide environmental tolerances and a nearly ubiquitous geographical distribution, being present on all major land masses except Antarctica and Iceland.

Ambient temperatures drive mosquito replication rates and transmission of WNV by affecting the peak season of mosquitoes and geographic variations. For example, increased temperatures can affect the rate of virus replication, speed up the virus evolution rate, and viral transmission efficiency. Furthermore, higher winter temperatures and warmer spring may lead to larger summer mosquito populations, increasing the risk for WNV. Similarly, rainfall may also drive mosquito replication rates and affect the seasonality and geographic variations of the virus. Studies show an association between heavy precipitation and higher incidence of reported WNV. Likewise, wind is another environmental factor that serves as a dispersal mechanism for mosquitoes.<ref name=\":11\" />\n[[File:Global distribution of West Nile virus-CDC.gif|thumb|Global Distribution of West Nile Virus CDC]]\nMosquitoes have extremely wide environmental tolerances and a nearly ubiquitous geographical distribution, being present on all major land masses except Antarctica and Iceland.

Despite this, Qaduli felt that these mistakes could be remedied by more effort, and so he decided to live in the same house as Julani to \"study his personality, and to assess his ability to lead.\" In January 2013, Qaduli sent a message to IS leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] in Iraq, warning him about Julani. He wrote \"He is a sneaky person with two faces. He loves himself and does not care about the religion of his soldiers. He is willing to sacrifice their blood just so he is mentioned in the media. He flies with joy like a children when his name is mentioned on the TV channels.\" Upon receiving the letter from Qaduli, Baghdadi decided to travel to Syria himself to try and correct the situation. In March 2013 there was a meeting between Qaduli, Baghdadi, Julani, [[Abu Maria al-Qahtani]] and some others where Julani cried and promised he would renew his allegiance to Baghdadi.

Despite this, Qaduli felt that these mistakes could be remedied by more effort, and so he decided to live in the same house as Julani to \"study his personality, and to assess his ability to lead.\" In January 2013, Qaduli sent a message to IS leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] in Iraq, warning him about Julani. He wrote \"He is a sneaky person with two faces. He loves himself and does not care about the religion of his soldiers. He is willing to sacrifice their blood just so he is mentioned in the media. He flies with joy like a children when his name is mentioned on the TV channels.\" Upon receiving the letter from Qaduli, Baghdadi decided to travel to Syria himself to try and correct the situation. In March 2013 there was a meeting between Qaduli, Baghdadi, Julani, [[Abu Maria al-Qahtani]] and some others where Julani cried and promised he would renew his allegiance to Baghdadi.
