Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} These included ''uburetwa'', a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them,{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=13}} and ''[[ubuhake]]'', under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nRwanda and neighbouring [[Burundi]] were assigned to Germany by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=218}} and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=24}} German policy was to rule the country through the Rwandan monarchy; this system had the added benefit of enabling colonization with small European troop numbers.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=25}} The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior.<ref>Bruce D. Jones, ''Peacemaking'', S. 17 f; Carsten Heeger, ''Die Erfindung'', S. 23\u201325.</ref> The Rwandan king welcomed the Germans, using their military strength to widen his rule.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=217\u201318}} [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian forces]] took control of Rwanda and Burundi during [[World War I]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=25\u201326}} and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=26}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=260}} The Belgians modernised the Rwandan economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=35}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutus to become honorary Tutsis, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n=== Revolution and Hutu\u2013Tutsi relations after independence ===\n{{Main|Rwandan Revolution}}\nAfter [[World War II]], a Hutu emancipation movement began to grow in Rwanda,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}} fuelled by increasing resentment of the inter-war social reforms, and also an increasing sympathy for the Hutu within the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} Catholic missionaries increasingly viewed themselves as responsible for empowering the underprivileged Hutu rather than the Tutsi elite, leading rapidly to the formation of a sizeable Hutu clergy and educated elite that provided a new counterbalance to the established political order.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} The monarchy and prominent Tutsis sensed the growing influence of the Hutu and began to agitate for immediate independence on their own terms.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}} In 1957, a group of Hutu scholars wrote the \"[[Bahutu Manifesto]]\". This was the first document to label the Tutsi and Hutu as separate races, and called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu based on what it termed \"statistical law\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nOn 1 November 1959 [[Dominique Mbonyumutwa]], a Hutu sub-chief, was attacked close to his home in [[Byimana]], [[Gitarama Province|Gitarama prefecture]],{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=124}} by supporters of the pro-Tutsi party. Mbonyumutwa survived, but rumours began spreading that he had been killed.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=58\u201359}} Hutu activists responded by killing Tutsis, both the elite and ordinary civilians, marking the beginning of the [[Rwandan Revolution]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=48\u201349}} The Tutsi responded with attacks of their own, but by this stage the Hutu had full backing from the Belgian administration who wanted to overturn the Tutsi domination.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=51}}{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|p=60}} In early 1960, the Belgians replaced most Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and organised mid-year commune elections which returned an overwhelming Hutu majority.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=51}} The king was deposed, a Hutu-dominated republic created, and the country became independent in 1962.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=53}}\nAs the revolution progressed, Tutsis began leaving the country to escape the Hutu purges, settling in the four neighbouring countries: Burundi, [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Zaire]].{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|pp=160\u201361}} These exiles, unlike the Banyarwanda who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial era, were regarded as refugees in their host countries,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=63\u201364}} and began almost immediately to agitate for a return to Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=55\u201356}} They formed armed groups, known as ''inyenzi'' (cockroaches), who launched attacks into Rwanda; these were largely unsuccessful, and led to further reprisal killings of 10,000 Tutsis and further Tutsi exiles.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=55\u201356}} By 1964, more than 300,000 Tutsis had fled, and were forced to remain in exile for the next three decades.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=62}} \n\n[[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]] presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=57}} He was overthrown following [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup in 1973]], which brought President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] to power.\nPro-Hutu and Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued in Rwanda itself, although the indiscriminate violence against the Tutsi did decrease somewhat.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} Habyarimana founded the [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (MRND) party in 1975,{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=117}} and promulgated a new constitution following a [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 referendum]], making the country a [[one-party state]] in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND.{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=116}} \n\nAt {{convert|408|PD/km2}}, Rwanda's [[population density]] is among the highest in Africa. [[Demographics of Rwanda|Rwanda's population]] had increased from 1.6&nbsp;million people in 1934 to 7.1&nbsp;million in 1989, leading to competition for land. Historians such as [[G\u00e9rard Prunier]] believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to population density.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=4}}\n\n=== Rwandan Civil War ===\n{{Main|Rwandan Civil War}}\n[[File:Paul Kagame 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Kagame]], commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Front for most of the Civil War|alt=Close up profile picture of Paul Kagame, taken in 2014]]\nIn the 1980s, a group of 500 Rwandan refugees in Uganda, led by [[Fred Rwigyema]], fought with the rebel [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) in the [[Ugandan Bush War]], which saw [[Yoweri Museveni]] overthrow [[Milton Obote]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=47}} These soldiers remained in the Ugandan army following Museveni's inauguration as [[President of Uganda|Ugandan president]], but simultaneously began planning an invasion of Rwanda through a covert network within the army's ranks.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} In October 1990, Rwigyema led a force of over 4,000{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=14}} rebels from Uganda, advancing {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} into Rwanda under the banner of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=94\u201395}} Rwigyema was killed on the third day of the attack,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=95\u201396}} and France and Zaire deployed forces in support of the Rwandan army, allowing them to repel the invasion.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Rwigyema's deputy, [[Paul Kagame]], took command of the RPF forces,{{sfn|Melvern|2000|pp=27\u201330}} organising a tactical retreat through Uganda to the [[Virunga Mountains]], a rugged area of northern Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=114\u201315}} From there, he rearmed and reorganised the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=117\u201318}}\n\nKagame restarted the war in January 1991, with a surprise attack on the northern town of [[Ruhengeri]]. The RPF captured the town, benefiting from the element of surprise, and held it for one day before retreating to the forests.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} For the next year, the RPF waged a hit-and-run style [[guerrilla war]], capturing some border areas but not making significant gains against the Rwandan army.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} In June 1992, following the formation of a multiparty coalition government in [[Kigali]], the RPF announced a ceasefire and began negotiations with the Rwandan government in [[Arusha]], Tanzania.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=150}} In early 1993, several extremist Hutu groups formed and began campaigns of large scale violence against the Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=173\u201374}} The RPF responded by suspending peace talks and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=174\u201377}} Peace negotiations eventually resumed in Arusha; the resulting set of agreements, known as the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]], were signed in August 1993 and gave the RPF positions in a Broad-Based Transitional Government (BBTG) and in the national army.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=190\u201391}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=187}} The [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), a peacekeeping force, arrived in the country and the RPF were given a base in the [[Parliament of Rwanda|national parliament]] building in Kigali, for use during the setting up of the BBTG.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|pp=126\u201331}}\n\n=== Hutu Power movement ===\nIn the early years of Habyarimana's regime, there was greater economic prosperity and reduced violence against Tutsis.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} Many hardline anti-Tutsi figures remained, however, including the family of the first lady [[Agathe Habyarimana]], who were known as the ''[[akazu]]'' or ''clan de Madame'',{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=85}} and the president relied on them to maintain his regime.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=12}} When the RPF invaded in October 1990, Habyarimana and the hardliners exploited the fear of the population to advance an anti-Tutsi agenda{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=108}} which became known as [[Hutu Power]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} \nTutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion. A pogrom was organised on 11 October 1990 in a commune in [[Gisenyi Province]], killing 383 Tutsi.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|pp=34\u201336}} A group of military officers and government members founded a magazine called ''Kangura'', which became popular throughout the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=49}} This published anti-Tutsi propaganda, including the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]], an explicit set of racist guidelines, including labelling Hutus who married Tutsis as \"traitors\".{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=50}} In 1992, the hardliners created the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR) party, which was linked to the ruling party but more [[right-wing]], and promoted an agenda critical of the president's alleged \"softness\" with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=128}}\n\nFollowing the 1992 ceasefire agreement, a number of the extremists in the Rwandan government and army began actively plotting against the president, worried about the possibility of Tutsis being included in government.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=166}} Habyarimana attempted to remove the hardliners from senior army positions, but was only partially successful; ''akazu'' affiliates [[Augustin Ndindiliyimana]] and [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] remained in powerful posts, providing the hardline family with a link to power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=167}} Throughout 1992, the hardliners carried out campaigns of localised killings of Tutsi, culminating in January 1993, in which extremists and local Hutu murdered around 300 people.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=173\u201374}} When the RPF resumed hostilities in February 1993, it cited these killings as the primary motive,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} but its effect was to increase support for the extremists amongst the Hutu population.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=180}}\n\nFrom mid-1993, the Hutu Power movement represented a third major force in Rwandan politics, in addition to Habyarimana's government and the traditional moderate opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} Apart from the CDR, there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u201382}} Instead, almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u201382}} Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the ''[[Interahamwe]]'', which was attached to the ruling party,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=129}} and the CDR's ''[[Impuzamugambi]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}} The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=25}} The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of their true purpose.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n=== Alleged preparation for genocide ===\nMany historians argue that the genocide was planned in advance of Habyarimana's assassination, although they do not agree on the precise date on which the idea of a \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first rooted. Gerard Prunier dates it to 1992, when Habyarimana began negotiating with the RPF,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} while journalist [[Linda Melvern]] dates it to 1990, following the initial RPF invasion.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=19}}\n\nIn 1990, the army began arming civilians with weapons such as machetes, and it began training the Hutu youth in combat, officially as a programme of \"civil defence\" against the RPF threat,{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} but these weapons were later used to carry out the genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=243}} Rwanda also purchased large numbers of grenades and munitions from late 1990; in one deal, future UN Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], in his role as [[Egypt]]ian foreign minister, facilitated a large sale of arms from Egypt.{{sfn|Melvern|2000|pp=31, 32}} The [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] (FAR) expanded rapidly at this time, growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} The new recruits were often poorly disciplined;{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} a divide grew between the elite Presidential Guard and [[Gendarmerie]] units, who were well trained and battle ready, and the ordinary rank and file.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=69}}\n\nIn March 1993, Hutu Power began compiling lists of \"traitors\" whom they planned to kill, and it is possible that Habyarimana's name was on these lists;{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} the CDR were publicly accusing the president of treason.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} The Power groups also believed that the national radio station, [[Radio Rwanda]], had become too liberal and supportive of the opposition; they founded a new radio station, [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLMC), which broadcast racist propaganda, obscene jokes and music, becoming very popular throughout the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=189}} One study finds that approximately 10% of the overall violence during the Rwandan genocide can be attributed to this new radio station.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Propaganda and Conflict: Evidence from the Rwandan Genocide|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/4/1947|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1 November 2014|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1947\u20131994|volume = 129|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/qje/qju020|language = en|first = David|last = Yanagizawa-Drott|citeseerx = 10.1.1.711.8827|access-date = 28 October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107171759/http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/4/1947|archive-date = 7 January 2016|url-status=live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> However, a recent paper questions the findings of that study.<ref>Danning, G.

Soldiers, police, and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu military and political leaders who could have assumed control in the ensuing [[power vacuum]]. Checkpoints and barricades were erected to screen all holders of the national [[Ethnic groups in Rwanda#Ethnic identity cards in contemporary Rwanda|ID card of Rwanda]], which contained ethnic classifications. (The [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonial government]] had introduced use of these classifications and IDs in 1933.) This enabled government forces to systematically identify and kill Tutsi.\n\nThey also recruited and pressured Hutu civilians to arm themselves with machetes, clubs, blunt objects, and other weapons and encouraged them to rape, maim, and kill their Tutsi neighbors and to destroy or steal their property. The RPF restarted its offensive soon after Habyarimana's assassination. It rapidly seized control of the northern part of the country and captured Kigali about 100 days later in mid-July, bringing an end to the genocide. During these events and in the aftermath, the United Nations (UN) and countries including the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Belgium]] were criticized for their inaction and failure to strengthen the force and mandate of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) peacekeepers.

each person passing the road block was required to show the national identity card, which included ethnicity, and any with Tutsi cards were slaughtered immediately.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} Many Hutu were also killed for a variety of reasons, including alleged sympathy for the moderate opposition parties, being a journalist or simply having a \"Tutsi appearance\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}}\n\nThe RPF was making slow but steady gains in the north and east of the country, ending the killings in each area occupied.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} The genocide was effectively ended during April in areas of Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kibungo and Kigali prefectures.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} The killings ceased during April in the ''akazu'' heartlands of western Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, as almost every Tutsi had been eliminated.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} Large numbers of Hutu in the RPF conquered areas fled, fearing retribution for the genocide;{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=312}} 500,000 Kibungo residents walked over the [[Rusumo Bridge|bridge]] at [[Rusumo Falls]], into Tanzania, in a few days at the end of April,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=336}} and were accommodated in United Nations camps effectively controlled by ousted leaders of the Hutu regime,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=313\u201314}} with the former prefect of Kibungo prefecture in overall control.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=337}}\n\nIn the remaining prefectures, killings continued throughout May and June, although they became increasingly low-key and sporadic;{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} most Tutsi were already dead, and the interim government wished to rein in the growing anarchy and engage the population in fighting the RPF.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=236}} On 23 June, around 2,500 soldiers entered southwestern Rwanda as part of the French-led United Nations ''[[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=291}} This was intended as a humanitarian mission, but the soldiers were not able to save significant numbers of lives.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=292}} The genocidal authorities were overtly welcoming of the French, displaying the French flag on their own vehicles, but slaughtering Tutsi who came out of hiding seeking protection.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=292}} In July, the RPF completed their conquest of the country, with the exception of the zone occupied by Operation Turquoise. The RPF took Kigali on 4 July,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=459}} and Gisenyi and the rest of the northwest on 18 July.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=298\u201399}} The genocide was over, but as had occurred in Kibungo, the Hutu population fled en masse across the border, this time into Zaire, with Bagosora and the other leaders accompanying them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=316}}\n\nGiven the chaotic situation, there is no consensus on the overall number of people killed during the genocide. Unlike the genocides carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]], authorities made no attempts to record deaths. The succeeding RPF government estimated that 1,074,017 were killed, 94% of whom were Tutsi.<ref name=lemarchand/> The journalist [[Philip Gourevitch]] agrees with an estimate of one million, while the UN estimates the death toll to be 800,000. [[Alison Des Forges]] of [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 507,000 Tutsis were killed by assuming an interior Tutsi population of 657,000 prior to the genocide and 150,000 survivors. Concerning killings by the RPF, Des Forges wrote that \"our research indicates considerable killing of civilians by RPF forces,\" but did not proffer an estimate due to lack of data, other than arguing that estimates in the range of 25,000 to 60,000 \"appear more likely to be accurate than claims that the RPF killed hundreds of thousands of people.\"{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-04.htm#P95_39230 \"Introduction \u00bb Numbers\"]}} Filip Reyntjens estimated that about 1.1&nbsp;million lives were lost during the time of the genocide.

Finding the population of Butare resistant to murdering their fellow citizens, the government flew in militia from Kigali by helicopter, and they readily killed the Tutsi.{{snf|Prunier|1998|p=244}}\n\nMost of the victims were killed in their own villages or in towns, often by their neighbors and fellow villagers. The militia typically murdered victims with [[machete]]s, although some army units used rifles. The Hutu gangs searched out victims hiding in churches and school buildings, and [[massacre]]d them. Local officials and government-sponsored radio incited ordinary citizens to kill their neighbors, and those who refused to kill were often murdered on the spot: \"Either you took part in the massacres or you were massacred yourself.\"{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=247}}\n\nOne such massacre [[Nyarubuye massacre|occurred at Nyarubuye]].

The Organic Law established four categories for those who were involved in the genocide, specifying the limits of punishment for members of each category. The first category was reserved those who were \"planners, organizers, instigators, supervisors and leaders\" of the genocide and any who used positions of state authority to promote the genocide. This category also applied to murderers who distinguished themselves on the basis of their zeal or cruelty, or who engaged in sexual torture. Members of this first category were eligible for the death sentence.<ref>\"Organic Law No. 08/96 of 303 August on the Organization of Prosecutions for Offences Constituting the Crimes of Genocide or Crimes against Humanity Committed since 1 October 1990\".</ref>\n\nWhile Rwanda had the death penalty prior to the 1996 Organic law, in practice no executions had taken place since 1982.

The RPF military victory and installation of an RPF-dominated government prompted many Hutu to flee to neighboring countries.\n\nToday, Rwanda has two [[Public holidays in Rwanda|public holidays]] which mourn the genocide. The national mourning period begins with Kwibuka (Remembrance), the national commemoration, on 7 April and it concludes with [[Liberation Day]] on 4 July.

Since 1997, SURF has been advocating and fundraising internationally in support of the efforts of grassroots survivors organisations in Rwanda, including IBUKA (National Umbrella of Survivors' Organisations), AVEGA (Association of Widows of the Genocide), AOCM (Association of Orphan-Headed Households), Uyisenga N'Manzi (Organisation of Child Survivors with HIV/AIDS) and Solace Ministries (Christian Survivors Support Organisation). Its focus is to ensure that the voices of survivors are listened to and heard, memories of the genocide are kept alive, victims of the genocide are never forgotten and survivors of the genocide are supported in Rwanda, and in the UK where it is based.\n\n===IBUKA===\n[[Ibuka (organisation)|IBUKA]] is a high-profile lobby group with a particular interest in addressing justice for survivors and coordinating and leading joint survivors\u2019 projects on a national level. A direct translation of IBUKA is \"remember\", which is the objective of the [[Umbrella organization|umbrella association]]. It is composed of ten member organisations, which work to perpetuate the memory of genocide and provide support to genocide survivors. Speaking out is a sign of confidence of the survivors and being heard increases that confidence, which is what IBUKA strives to achieve.\n\n===AVEGA===\n[[AVEGA]] was founded in 1995 by 50 widowed survivors, who realised after the genocide that there was no one left to care for them or their children.  The charity provides a means of support and recovery, and promotes self-fulfilment and self-reliance through many programmes, ranging from social networking to job training and from home construction to peer counselling.  AVEGA now has five centres across Rwanda.\n\n===AOCM===\nAOCM respond to the needs of orphans who survived the genocide, in particular to promote the general welfare of its 40,000 members in 10,000 orphan-headed households.  Its staff are all orphans themselves who head households. SURF helped AOCM build its capacity to advocate to give orphaned survivors of the genocide a stronger voice in Rwanda. AOCM is now an established and reputable, growing child-advocacy organisation.\n\n===Uyisenga N'Manzi===\nUyisenga N'Manzi is a community-based organization that provides economic, educational and health-related support for child-headed households in [[Kigali]]. According to the International Fund for Rwanda, over 120,000 homes became child-headed households as a result of the 1994 genocide, and that number continues to grow as adults succumb to AIDS. In some cases, the head of household is as young as 10 or 12.\n\n===Solace Ministries===\nSolace Ministries is an officially registered Christian based charity, which supports traumatized widows and orphans of genocide, especially people living with HIV/AIDS.  It helps to restore hope and overcome feelings of despair, loneliness, hatred, anger and resentment among its members.  Its programs include counseling; childcare and development programs; community development programs; health and relief; capacity building and research.  More importantly, it provides a vital secure environment for survivors to meet and pray together.\n\n===Streets Ahead Rwanda===\n[[SACCA UK|Streets Ahead Rwanda]] supports street children living in Eastern Rwanda who continue to suffer the effects of the Rwandan genocide. The charity works in partnership with the Streets Ahead Children's Centre which is an NGO based in Rwanda.

Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} These included ''uburetwa'', a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them,{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=13}} and ''[[ubuhake]]'', under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nRwanda and neighbouring [[Burundi]] were assigned to Germany by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=218}} and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=24}} German policy was to rule the country through the Rwandan monarchy; this system had the added benefit of enabling colonization with small European troop numbers.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=25}} The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior.<ref>Bruce D.

While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutus to become honorary Tutsis, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n=== Revolution and Hutu\u2013Tutsi relations after independence ===\n{{Main|Rwandan Revolution}}\nAfter [[World War II]], a Hutu emancipation movement began to grow in Rwanda,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}} fuelled by increasing resentment of the inter-war social reforms, and also an increasing sympathy for the Hutu within the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} Catholic missionaries increasingly viewed themselves as responsible for empowering the underprivileged Hutu rather than the Tutsi elite, leading rapidly to the formation of a sizeable Hutu clergy and educated elite that provided a new counterbalance to the established political order.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} The monarchy and prominent Tutsis sensed the growing influence of the Hutu and began to agitate for immediate independence on their own terms.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}} In 1957, a group of Hutu scholars wrote the \"[[Bahutu Manifesto]]\". This was the first document to label the Tutsi and Hutu as separate races, and called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu based on what it termed \"statistical law\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nOn 1 November 1959 [[Dominique Mbonyumutwa]], a Hutu sub-chief, was attacked close to his home in [[Byimana]], [[Gitarama Province|Gitarama prefecture]],{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=124}} by supporters of the pro-Tutsi party.

A pogrom was organised on 11 October 1990 in a commune in [[Gisenyi Province]], killing 383 Tutsi.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|pp=34\u201336}} A group of military officers and government members founded a magazine called ''Kangura'', which became popular throughout the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=49}} This published anti-Tutsi propaganda, including the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]], an explicit set of racist guidelines, including labelling Hutus who married Tutsis as \"traitors\".{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=50}} In 1992, the hardliners created the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR) party, which was linked to the ruling party but more [[right-wing]], and promoted an agenda critical of the president's alleged \"softness\" with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=128}}\n\nFollowing the 1992 ceasefire agreement, a number of the extremists in the Rwandan government and army began actively plotting against the president, worried about the possibility of Tutsis being included in government.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=166}} Habyarimana attempted to remove the hardliners from senior army positions, but was only partially successful; ''akazu'' affiliates [[Augustin Ndindiliyimana]] and [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] remained in powerful posts, providing the hardline family with a link to power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=167}} Throughout 1992, the hardliners carried out campaigns of localised killings of Tutsi, culminating in January 1993, in which extremists and local Hutu murdered around 300 people.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=173\u201374}} When the RPF resumed hostilities in February 1993, it cited these killings as the primary motive,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} but its effect was to increase support for the extremists amongst the Hutu population.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=180}}\n\nFrom mid-1993, the Hutu Power movement represented a third major force in Rwandan politics, in addition to Habyarimana's government and the traditional moderate opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} Apart from the CDR, there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u201382}} Instead, almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u201382}} Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the ''[[Interahamwe]]'', which was attached to the ruling party,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=129}} and the CDR's ''[[Impuzamugambi]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}} The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=25}} The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of their true purpose.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n=== Alleged preparation for genocide ===\nMany historians argue that the genocide was planned in advance of Habyarimana's assassination, although they do not agree on the precise date on which the idea of a \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first rooted. Gerard Prunier dates it to 1992, when Habyarimana began negotiating with the RPF,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} while journalist [[Linda Melvern]] dates it to 1990, following the initial RPF invasion.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=19}}\n\nIn 1990, the army began arming civilians with weapons such as machetes, and it began training the Hutu youth in combat, officially as a programme of \"civil defence\" against the RPF threat,{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} but these weapons were later used to carry out the genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=243}} Rwanda also purchased large numbers of grenades and munitions from late 1990; in one deal, future UN Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], in his role as [[Egypt]]ian foreign minister, facilitated a large sale of arms from Egypt.{{sfn|Melvern|2000|pp=31, 32}} The [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] (FAR) expanded rapidly at this time, growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} The new recruits were often poorly disciplined;{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} a divide grew between the elite Presidential Guard and [[Gendarmerie]] units, who were well trained and battle ready, and the ordinary rank and file.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=69}}\n\nIn March 1993, Hutu Power began compiling lists of \"traitors\" whom they planned to kill, and it is possible that Habyarimana's name was on these lists;{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} the CDR were publicly accusing the president of treason.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} The Power groups also believed that the national radio station, [[Radio Rwanda]], had become too liberal and supportive of the opposition; they founded a new radio station, [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLMC), which broadcast racist propaganda, obscene jokes and music, becoming very popular throughout the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=189}} One study finds that approximately 10% of the overall violence during the Rwandan genocide can be attributed to this new radio station.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Propaganda and Conflict: Evidence from the Rwandan Genocide|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/4/1947|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1 November 2014|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1947\u20131994|volume = 129|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/qje/qju020|language = en|first = David|last = Yanagizawa-Drott|citeseerx = 10.1.1.711.8827|access-date = 28 October 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107171759/http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/4/1947|archive-date = 7 January 2016|url-status=live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> However, a recent paper questions the findings of that study.<ref>Danning, G.

Soldiers, police, and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu military and political leaders who could have assumed control in the ensuing [[power vacuum]]. Checkpoints and barricades were erected to screen all holders of the national [[Ethnic groups in Rwanda#Ethnic identity cards in contemporary Rwanda|ID card of Rwanda]], which contained ethnic classifications. (The [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonial government]] had introduced use of these classifications and IDs in 1933.) This enabled government forces to systematically identify and kill Tutsi.\n\nThey also recruited and pressured Hutu civilians to arm themselves with machetes, clubs, blunt objects, and other weapons and encouraged them to rape, maim, and kill their Tutsi neighbors and to destroy or steal their property. The RPF restarted its offensive soon after Habyarimana's assassination. It rapidly seized control of the northern part of the country and captured Kigali about 100 days later in mid-July, bringing an end to the genocide. During these events and in the aftermath, the United Nations (UN) and countries including the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Belgium]] were criticized for their inaction and failure to strengthen the force and mandate of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) peacekeepers.

each person passing the road block was required to show the national identity card, which included ethnicity, and any with Tutsi cards were slaughtered immediately.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} Many Hutu were also killed for a variety of reasons, including alleged sympathy for the moderate opposition parties, being a journalist or simply having a \"Tutsi appearance\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}}\n\nThe RPF was making slow but steady gains in the north and east of the country, ending the killings in each area occupied.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} The genocide was effectively ended during April in areas of Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kibungo and Kigali prefectures.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} The killings ceased during April in the ''akazu'' heartlands of western Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, as almost every Tutsi had been eliminated.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} Large numbers of Hutu in the RPF conquered areas fled, fearing retribution for the genocide;{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=312}} 500,000 Kibungo residents walked over the [[Rusumo Bridge|bridge]] at [[Rusumo Falls]], into Tanzania, in a few days at the end of April,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=336}} and were accommodated in United Nations camps effectively controlled by ousted leaders of the Hutu regime,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=313\u201314}} with the former prefect of Kibungo prefecture in overall control.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=337}}\n\nIn the remaining prefectures, killings continued throughout May and June, although they became increasingly low-key and sporadic;{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=261}} most Tutsi were already dead, and the interim government wished to rein in the growing anarchy and engage the population in fighting the RPF.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=236}} On 23 June, around 2,500 soldiers entered southwestern Rwanda as part of the French-led United Nations ''[[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=291}} This was intended as a humanitarian mission, but the soldiers were not able to save significant numbers of lives.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=292}} The genocidal authorities were overtly welcoming of the French, displaying the French flag on their own vehicles, but slaughtering Tutsi who came out of hiding seeking protection.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=292}} In July, the RPF completed their conquest of the country, with the exception of the zone occupied by Operation Turquoise. The RPF took Kigali on 4 July,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=459}} and Gisenyi and the rest of the northwest on 18 July.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=298\u201399}} The genocide was over, but as had occurred in Kibungo, the Hutu population fled en masse across the border, this time into Zaire, with Bagosora and the other leaders accompanying them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=316}}\n\nGiven the chaotic situation, there is no consensus on the overall number of people killed during the genocide. Unlike the genocides carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]], authorities made no attempts to record deaths. The succeeding RPF government estimated that 1,074,017 were killed, 94% of whom were Tutsi.<ref name=lemarchand/> The journalist [[Philip Gourevitch]] agrees with an estimate of one million, while the UN estimates the death toll to be 800,000.

Finding the population of Butare resistant to murdering their fellow citizens, the government flew in militia from Kigali by helicopter, and they readily killed the Tutsi.{{snf|Prunier|1998|p=244}}\n\nMost of the victims were killed in their own villages or in towns, often by their neighbors and fellow villagers. The militia typically murdered victims with [[machete]]s, although some army units used rifles. The Hutu gangs searched out victims hiding in churches and school buildings, and [[massacre]]d them. Local officials and government-sponsored radio incited ordinary citizens to kill their neighbors, and those who refused to kill were often murdered on the spot: \"Either you took part in the massacres or you were massacred yourself.\"{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=247}}\n\nOne such massacre [[Nyarubuye massacre|occurred at Nyarubuye]].

After the genocide, over one million people were potentially culpable for a role in the genocide, nearly one-fifth of the population remaining after the summer of 1994. After the genocide, the RPF pursued a policy of mass arrests for the genocide, jailing over 100,000 in the two years after the genocide. The pace of arrests overwhelmed the physical capacity of the Rwandan prison system, leading to what Amnesty International deemed \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Rwanda.|journal=Human Rights Review|volume=10:99}}</ref> The country's nineteen prisons were designed to hold about eighteen thousand inmates, but at their peak in 1998 there were 100,000 people in detention facilities across the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGovernment institutions, including judicial courts, were destroyed, and many judges, prosecutors, and employees were murdered.

The Organic Law established four categories for those who were involved in the genocide, specifying the limits of punishment for members of each category. The first category was reserved those who were \"planners, organizers, instigators, supervisors and leaders\" of the genocide and any who used positions of state authority to promote the genocide. This category also applied to murderers who distinguished themselves on the basis of their zeal or cruelty, or who engaged in sexual torture.

The [[Rape during the Rwandan genocide|pervasive use of rape as a weapon of war]] caused a spike in [[HIV]] infection, including babies born to mothers infected during rapes. Due to the wholesale slaughter of both men and women, many households were headed by widows or totally orphaned children.<ref>[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/children-of-the-genocide-in-rwanda/ \"Children of the genocide in Rwanda\", April 1, 1995, Radio Netherlands Worldwide]</ref> The destruction of infrastructure and the severe depopulation of the country crippled [[Economy of Rwanda|the economy]], challenging the nascent government to achieve rapid economic growth and stabilization. The RPF military victory and installation of an RPF-dominated government prompted many Hutu to flee to neighboring countries.\n\nToday, Rwanda has two [[Public holidays in Rwanda|public holidays]] which mourn the genocide. The national mourning period begins with Kwibuka (Remembrance), the national commemoration, on 7 April and it concludes with [[Liberation Day]] on 4 July. The week following 7 April is an official week of mourning, known as ''Icyunamo''. As a result of the genocide, nations collaborated to establish the [[International Criminal Court]] in order to prosecute genocide, [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crimes]].\n\n== Survivors ==\nThere are an estimated 300,000 survivors of the Rwandan genocide.\n\nThe 2007 report on the living conditions of survivors conducted by the Ministry in charge of Social Affairs in Rwanda reported the following situation of survivors:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miraclecorners.org/programs_partner_jacqueline.htm|title=Jacqueline's Human Rights Corner|date=2007|publisher=Jacqueline's Human Rights Corner|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501203037/http://www.miraclecorners.org/programs_partner_jacqueline.htm|archive-date=1 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ Survivors of the Rwandan genocide\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Number of survivors\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Very vulnerable survivors\n| align=\"right\" | 120,080\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Shelterless\n| align=\"right\" | 39,685\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Orphans living in households headed by children\n| align=\"right\" | 28,904\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Widows\n| align=\"right\" | 49,656\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Disabled during the genocide\n| align=\"right\" | 27,498\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Children and youth with no access to school\n| align=\"right\" | 15,438\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Graduates from high school with no access to higher education\n| align=\"right\" | 8,000\n|}\n\n===Survivor organizations===\nThere are a number of organizations representing and supporting these survivors of the genocide. These include the [[Survivors Fund]], [[IBUKA]] and [[AVEGA]].<ref>{{cite web |work=Survivors Fund |url=https://survivors-fund.org.uk/awareness-raising/come-together/ |title=Come Together |date=10 February 2014 |author=Sam Munderere}}</ref>\n<!-- Commenting out, pending better referencing\n===SURF===\nSURF (or the [[Survivors Fund]]) is the main international charity dedicated to aiding and assisting the survivors of the Rwandan genocide. Since 1997, SURF has been advocating and fundraising internationally in support of the efforts of grassroots survivors organisations in Rwanda, including IBUKA (National Umbrella of Survivors' Organisations), AVEGA (Association of Widows of the Genocide), AOCM (Association of Orphan-Headed Households), Uyisenga N'Manzi (Organisation of Child Survivors with HIV/AIDS) and Solace Ministries (Christian Survivors Support Organisation). Its focus is to ensure that the voices of survivors are listened to and heard, memories of the genocide are kept alive, victims of the genocide are never forgotten and survivors of the genocide are supported in Rwanda, and in the UK where it is based.\n\n===IBUKA===\n[[Ibuka (organisation)|IBUKA]] is a high-profile lobby group with a particular interest in addressing justice for survivors and coordinating and leading joint survivors\u2019 projects on a national level. A direct translation of IBUKA is \"remember\", which is the objective of the [[Umbrella organization|umbrella association]]. It is composed of ten member organisations, which work to perpetuate the memory of genocide and provide support to genocide survivors. Speaking out is a sign of confidence of the survivors and being heard increases that confidence, which is what IBUKA strives to achieve.\n\n===AVEGA===\n[[AVEGA]] was founded in 1995 by 50 widowed survivors, who realised after the genocide that there was no one left to care for them or their children.  The charity provides a means of support and recovery, and promotes self-fulfilment and self-reliance through many programmes, ranging from social networking to job training and from home construction to peer counselling.  AVEGA now has five centres across Rwanda.\n\n===AOCM===\nAOCM respond to the needs of orphans who survived the genocide, in particular to promote the general welfare of its 40,000 members in 10,000 orphan-headed households.  Its staff are all orphans themselves who head households. SURF helped AOCM build its capacity to advocate to give orphaned survivors of the genocide a stronger voice in Rwanda. AOCM is now an established and reputable, growing child-advocacy organisation.\n\n===Uyisenga N'Manzi===\nUyisenga N'Manzi is a community-based organization that provides economic, educational and health-related support for child-headed households in [[Kigali]]. According to the International Fund for Rwanda, over 120,000 homes became child-headed households as a result of the 1994 genocide, and that number continues to grow as adults succumb to AIDS. In some cases, the head of household is as young as 10 or 12.\n\n===Solace Ministries===\nSolace Ministries is an officially registered Christian based charity, which supports traumatized widows and orphans of genocide, especially people living with HIV/AIDS.  It helps to restore hope and overcome feelings of despair, loneliness, hatred, anger and resentment among its members.  Its programs include counseling; childcare and development programs; community development programs; health and relief; capacity building and research.  More importantly, it provides a vital secure environment for survivors to meet and pray together.\n\n===Streets Ahead Rwanda===\n[[SACCA UK|Streets Ahead Rwanda]] supports street children living in Eastern Rwanda who continue to suffer the effects of the Rwandan genocide. The charity works in partnership with the Streets Ahead Children's Centre which is an NGO based in Rwanda. The centre is based in Kayonza but reintegrates children across the entire country.-->\n\n== Media and popular culture ==\n{{See also|List of films about the Rwandan Genocide|Bibliography of the Rwandan genocide}}\nCanadian Lieutenant-General Rom\u00e9o Dallaire became the best-known eyewitness to the [[genocide]] after co-writing the book ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda]]'' (2003) describing his experiences with depression and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref>[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/168/9/1164 \"Camouflage and exposure\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814165039/http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/168/9/1164 |date=14 August 2007 }}, ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'', 29 April 2003; 168 (9)</ref> Dallaire's book was made into the movie ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (2007 film)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'' (2007).\n\nAnother firsthand account of the Rwandan genocide is offered by Dr. [[James Orbinski]] in his book ''An Imperfect Offering: Humanitarian Action in the Twenty-first Century''.\n\n[[Immacul\u00e9e Ilibagiza]] documented her story in ''Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust'', which recounts how she survived for 91 days with seven other women during the genocide, in a damp and small bathroom, no larger than {{convert|3|ft|m}} long and {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide.\n\n[[Gil Courtemanche]], a French-Canadian writer, authored ''Dimanche \u00e0 la piscine \u00e0 Kigali'' (''[[A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali]]''), which focuses on events in Kigali during the genocide.

The multiple different versions have been made to promote the song on a wider European market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evropesma.org/Serbia2009 |title=Serbia 2009 - Marko Kon & Milan Nikoli\u0107 - Cipela |accessdate=2009-05-02 |publisher=OGAE Serbia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424062042/http://www.evropesma.org/Serbia2009 |archive-date=2009-04-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Use of accordion ==\nThe prominent instrument throughout the entire song is the [[accordion]], a popular instrument within [[Serbian folk music|Serbian national folk music]].

The song contains many sarcastic motifs and references to materialism. The refrain of the song states that she did not want to be with him until he managed to get money and get rich. The song is highly repetitive with the refrain lyrics repeating a total of six times while the two other verses appear twice throughout the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tekstovi-pesama.com/Marko-Kon-i-Milan-Nikolic--SERBIA--2009-eurovision/cipela/28605/1/ |title=Marko Kon i Milan Nikolic (SERBIA) 2009 eurovision - cipela |accessdate=2009-05-02 |work= |publisher=Tekstovi Pesama |date= }}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.diggiloo.net/?2009rs Serbian language version lyrics with an English translation]\n* [http://www.diggiloo.net/?2009rs16 Russian language version lyrics with an English translation]\n* [http://www.diggiloo.net/?2009rs21 Hebrew language version lyrics with an English translation]\n* [http://www.diggiloo.net/?2009rs19 Finnish language version lyrics]\n* [http://www.diggiloo.net/?2009rs20 English language version lyrics]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box|\n before=\"[[Oro (song)|Oro]]\" by \"[[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]]\"|\n title=[[Beovizija]] winners|\n after=\"[[Ovo je Balkan]]\" by \"[[Milan Stankovi\u0107]]\"|\n years=2009|\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest|songs}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest 2009|songs}}\n\n[[Category:Eurovision songs of 2009]]\n[[Category:Eurovision songs of Serbia]]\n[[Category:2009 songs]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "punct", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipela"}

It is located on the [[Tampa Reservation]] off of [[Interstate 4]], just east of [[Tampa, Florida]]. The 190,000 square foot casino is the sixth-largest in the world, and has been expanded multiple times since its opening. It is a 24-hour venue that permits smoking indoors. Richard Bantock is banned for running unclothed through the lobby.\n\nIt includes many displays of [[rock and roll]] memorabilia, such as clothing and musical instruments. Rock videos and music play on multiple screens, including one displayed inside a waterfall. Many song lyrics are displayed on the walls. Among its many services are a [[food court]] and [[tour bus]] parking. Special membership cards allow points accumulated by gambling to be redeemed for retail discounts.\n\n==History==\nIn 1980, while excavating to build a parking garage in downtown Tampa, Indian remains were discovered. They were exhumed and relocated to 8.3 acres of land east of Tampa, that was granted reservation status to the Seminole Tribe one year later. Taking advantage of reservation status, the tribe opened a museum, a [[smoke shop]] and a high-stakes bingo hall by 1982. Eventually a Four Points [[Sheraton Hotel]] opened on the land, and slot machines and poker were added to games offered. In 2000, the Seminoles announced plans to rebuild the casino as a Hard Rock Casino. The Hard Rock Casino opened in 2003, with the hotel opening the following year. Over time, the [[Florida Legislature]] has changed laws allowing new games at the casino, including Vegas-style [[slot machine]]s and [[blackjack]]. Major expansions of the casino occurred in 2007 and 2012, making it the largest in Florida.\n\n==Features==\nAside from the casino, the hotel has a 12-story tower, a pool, a [[fitness center]], and three [[parking garage]]s. There are many restaurants, including the locally acclaimed Council Oak Steak House, The Fresh Harvest buffet, Rock and Raw sushi bar, The Rise Deli, JuBao Noodle Palace, an international food court, a large [[Hard Rock Cafe]], which regularly hosts live stage performances, as well as others.

It is located on the [[Tampa Reservation]] off of [[Interstate 4]], just east of [[Tampa, Florida]]. The 190,000 square foot casino is the sixth-largest in the world, and has been expanded multiple times since its opening. It is a 24-hour venue that permits smoking indoors.\n\nIt includes many displays of [[rock and roll]] memorabilia, such as clothing and musical instruments. Rock videos and music play on multiple screens, including one displayed inside a waterfall. Many song lyrics are displayed on the walls. Among its many services are a [[food court]] and [[tour bus]] parking. Special membership cards allow points accumulated by gambling to be redeemed for retail discounts.\n\n==History==\nIn 1980, while excavating to build a parking garage in downtown Tampa, Indian remains were discovered. They were exhumed and relocated to 8.3 acres of land east of Tampa, that was granted reservation status to the Seminole Tribe one year later. Taking advantage of reservation status, the tribe opened a museum, a [[smoke shop]] and a high-stakes bingo hall by 1982. Eventually a Four Points [[Sheraton Hotel]] opened on the land, and slot machines and poker were added to games offered. In 2000, the Seminoles announced plans to rebuild the casino as a Hard Rock Casino. The Hard Rock Casino opened in 2003, with the hotel opening the following year. Over time, the [[Florida Legislature]] has changed laws allowing new games at the casino, including Vegas-style [[slot machine]]s and [[blackjack]]. Major expansions of the casino occurred in 2007 and 2012, making it the largest in Florida.\n\n==Features==\nAside from the casino, the hotel has a 12-story tower, a pool, a [[fitness center]], and three [[parking garage]]s. There are many restaurants, including the locally acclaimed Council Oak Steak House, The Fresh Harvest buffet, Rock and Raw sushi bar, The Rise Deli, JuBao Noodle Palace, an international food court, a large [[Hard Rock Cafe]], which regularly hosts live stage performances, as well as others. For shopping there are multiple stores, including the Rain Maker tribal gift shop, the Hard Rock Store and a Seminole Smoke Shop. There are also multiple bars located around the casino floor, including the L Bar, the Center Bar and others. Additional features include a non-smoking game room and a high-rollers club room. Musical memorabilia exhibits can be found throughout the complex.\n\nIn 2019, a 14-story hotel tower was added to the property<ref>https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seminole-hard-rock-hotel--casino-tampa-reveals-700-million-expansion-completion-with-grand-celebration-300930978.html</ref>.\n\n==Casino==\nThe 190,000+ square foot casino is the fourth-largest in the United States and sixth-largest in the world.
