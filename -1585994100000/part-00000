The [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] were the first team to declare their intention to become fully professional. Other teams quickly followed suit. By 1871, several clubs, wanting to separate fully from the amateur association, broke away to found the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. (The remaining amateur clubs founded the National Association of Amateur Base Ball Players, which only lasted two years). In 1876, wanting an even stronger central organization, six clubs from the NA and two independents established the [[National League]]: [[History of the Atlanta Braves#Boston years|Boston Red Stockings]], [[Hartford Dark Blues|Hartford]], [[New York Mutuals|Mutual]], [[Athletic of Philadelphia|Athletic]], [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago]], and the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]] from the NA plus independent clubs [[Louisville Grays|Louisville]] and Cincinnati.\n\nThe NA was the first professional baseball league. Its status as a major league is [[National Association as a major league|in dispute]]. [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] do not recognize it as a major league, but the NA comprised most of the professional clubs and the highest caliber of play then in existence. Its players, managers, and umpires are included among the \"major leaguers\" who define the scope of many encyclopedias and many databases developed by SABR or Retrosheet.\n\nSeveral factors limited the lifespan of the National Association including dominance by a single team (Boston) for most of the league's existence, instability of franchises as several were placed in cities too small to financially support professional baseball, lack of central authority, and suspicions of the influence of gamblers.\n\n== Member clubs ==\n{{HistBaseball_nav}}\nProfessional baseball clubs in the 19th century were often known by what is now regarded as a \"nickname\", although it was actually the club's name. This was a practice carried over from the amateur days .The singular form of a \"nickname\" was often the team name itself, with its base city \"understood\" and was so listed in the standings. Rather than \"Brooklyn Atlantics\", the team was simply called \"Atlantic\", or \"Atlantic of Brooklyn\" if deemed necessary by the writer. Another common practice was to refer to the team in the plural, hence the \"Bostons\" the \"Chicagos\" or the \"Mutuals\". Sometimes the team would have a nickname, usually something to do with the team colors, such as the Boston Red Stockings, Chicago White Stockings, and Mutual Green Stockings.\n\nThis practice of using the singular form of the \"nickname\" as the team name faded with time, although as recently as the early 1900s, the team generally known as \"[[Philadelphia Athletics]]\" was shown in the [[American League]] standings as \"Athletic\", the traditional way. That team sported an old-English \"A\" on its jerseys, as had its nominative predecessors.\n\nLater, the ''[[Encyclopedia of Baseball]]'' attempted to retrofit the names into a modern context.

It is located about an hour and a half drive to [[Morelia]] or [[Uruapan]] and just 20 minutes from the famous colonial town of [[P\u00e1tzcuaro]]. The estimated population is about 5,000 people.\n\n==History==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==The town==\nErongar\u00edcuaro is hidden high in the mountains of [[Michoac\u00e1n]] at 2,200 m (7,130 feet) of elevation.  To the east is [[Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro]], one of [[Mexico]]'s highest lakes.\n\nThe town retains its ancient atmosphere. It consists of largely one-story [[adobe]] or plaster-over-brick buildings with red tile roofs. The streets are dusty cobblestones traveled by horse and car. The plaza has a fountain, stage and amazing collection of trees.\n\nWandering the streets uphill, there is a cemetery and a chapel.\n\n==Culture==\n\n* Annual Flower Show\n* Tuesday Goodness Market - with homemade breads and cheeses\n\n==Entertainment==\nJaripeos, parties and festivals are common throughout the year.\n\n==Food==\nThe ''nieve'' (ice cream), sold in shops on the plaza, is a delightful treat. There are many different flavors, made with water or cream. Combinations of flavors add variety and taste. One of the most popular flavors is called ''pasta'' (paste).  Popsicles made from exotic fruits are a pleasant taste adventure.\n\nExcept for early evening there is always food on the plaza. Food in the evening would be ''atole'' (hot beverage) with ''bu\u00f1uelos'' (light fried pastries) or tamales.\n\n==Shopping==\n\n* Women's craft market\n* Furniture and woodcrafts\n\n==Notable residents of Eronga==\n* [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] - The popular leftist President of Mexico was rumored to take his boat across the lake where no road reached.

The president arranged for the two young women, who were singers of some note on local radio and in local concerts, to attend music and voice classes at Bellas Artes in Mexico City, but their conservative father refused to let them, saying, \"A young woman's place is in the home.\" Victoria came to be the town's mayor \u2014 the only female mayor in the history of the town \u2014 and her sister Guadalupe was the town's postmistress. The post office was in the entrance of the house.

It is located about an hour and a half drive to [[Morelia]] or [[Uruapan]] and just 20 minutes from the famous colonial town of [[P\u00e1tzcuaro]]. The estimated population is about 5,000 people.\n\n==History==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==The town==\nErongar\u00edcuaro is hidden high in the mountains of [[Michoac\u00e1n]] at 2,200 m (7,130 feet) of elevation.  To the east is [[Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro]], one of [[Mexico]]'s highest lakes.\n\nThe town retains its ancient atmosphere. It consists of largely one-story [[adobe]] or plaster-over-brick buildings with red tile roofs. The streets are dusty cobblestones traveled by horse and car. The plaza has a fountain, stage and amazing collection of trees.\n\nWandering the streets uphill, there is a cemetery and a chapel.\n\n==Culture==\n\n* Annual Flower Show\n* Tuesday Goodness Market - with homemade breads and cheeses\n\n==Entertainment==\nJaripeos, parties and festivals are common throughout the year.\n\n==Food==\nThe ''nieve'' (ice cream), sold in shops on the plaza, is a delightful treat. There are many different flavors, made with water or cream. Combinations of flavors add variety and taste. One of the most popular flavors is called ''pasta'' (paste).  Popsicles made from exotic fruits are a pleasant taste adventure.\n\nExcept for early evening there is always food on the plaza. Food in the evening would be ''atole'' (hot beverage) with ''bu\u00f1uelos'' (light fried pastries) or tamales.\n\n==Shopping==\n\n* Women's craft market\n* Furniture and woodcrafts\n\n==Notable residents of Eronga==\n* [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] - The popular leftist President of Mexico was rumored to take his boat across the lake where no road reached.
