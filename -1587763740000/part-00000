Sethu and Roy do con jobs to make ends meet and save money to send Roy abroad for a better life. They attempt a burglary that goes wrong and lands them in jail. After their release, Sethu decides to part ways with Roy. Sethu reaches the lodge as he's in love with Rathna. Chakkuni helps Sethu by giving him some educational certificates that belonged to a previous tenant. Sethu changes his name to Albert (the name on the educational certificate) and lands in a job as a company supervisor. Sethu lives in fear that someone will recognize him as Sethu costing him his job and sending him to prison again for forgery. Bharathan Menon, a friend of Sethu's boss and comes to visit him along with his family. His daughter is depressed and refuses marriage. Menon's meeting with Sethu startles and surprises him. He informs Sethu that he has seen him somewhere and starts probing, which frightens Sethu.\n\nSalim ([[Keerikkadan Jose]]) comes to town and starts inquiring about Albert. His agenda is to bump off Sethu. his first attempt fails. After Sethu returns, he sees Roy who has come to meet him. After dropping him off, Salim attacks Sethu again but loses his life accidentally.\n\nIssac Thomas ([[Sukumaran]]) investigates Salim's death. He finds a note of Albert's address in Salim's wallet and his encounter with Sethu raises doubt of Sethu's actual identity. The investigation begins and becomes more complex. The real Albert is dead and the suspect list is long, as everyone has a motive to kill Albert. Issac Thomas' investigation leads him from one suspect to another, and finally, it is revealed that it was Francis who killed Albert to protect his brother Binoy & his friends, who raped Menon's daughter while she was eloping with Albert. Francis then dumps Albert's body in Menon's garage and proceeds to blackmail him to get more time for an earlier deal they had between them. Sethu is exonerated and reunites with Roy & Rathnamma.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Jayaram]] as Sethumadhavan\n*[[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]] as Roy\n*[[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]] as Rathnamma\n*[[Sukumaran]]  as Issac Thomas\n*[[Jagathi Sreekumar]] as Chakkunni\n*[[Manoj K.

However, Fiesta was the first widely mass-promoted and marketed solid-color [[dinnerware]] in the US.\n\nWhen it was introduced, the decoration of [[dinnerware]] and [[kitchenware]] [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] was still inspired by the [[Victorian era]], based on full, predetermined sets of dinnerware, all decorated with the same [[decal]] designs.  With its solid color glazes and mix-and-match concept, Fiesta represented something radically new to the general public. The forms and surfaces expressed an [[Art Deco]] influence. At introduction, the Fiesta line of dinnerware comprised some 37 different pieces, including such occasional pieces as candle holders in two designs, a bud vase, and an ash tray.  A set of seven nested mixing bowls ranged in size, from the smallest at five inches in diameter up to a nearly twelve-inch diameter.<ref name=huxford/>  The company sold basic table service sets for four, six and eight persons, made up of the usual dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, and cup and saucer.  But, the promotion and presentation of Fiesta from the start was as a line of open-stock items from which the individual purchaser could choose to combine serving and place pieces by personal preference and need.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAs an early Homer Laughlin Company brochure said:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n<blockquote>\"COLOR!  that's the trend today ...\" and it went on to say, \"It gives the hostess the opportunity to create her own table effects ... Plates of one color, Cream Soups of another, contrasting Cups and Saucers ... it's FUN to set a table with Fiesta!\" </blockquote>\n\nThe Homer Laughlin Company quickly added several additional items to the line. During this period some items were modified, and several items were eliminated, including the covered onion soup bowl, and the mixing bowl covers. In the years up to 1940, the line was expanded by the production of more new items.  At its most numerous, the Fiesta line comprised approximately 64 different items, including flower [[vase]]s in three sizes, divided plates, water tumblers, [[Decanter|carafes]], [[teapot]]s in two sizes, five part relish trays, and large chop plates in fifteen-inch and thirteen-inch diameters.  In addition, it offered several unique promotional items for one dollar each, available only in a predetermined glaze color.\n\nWith [[World War II]] and the need for manufacturers to focus on production for that effort, non-war related production and public demand declined.  Beginning in 1942, the Fiesta line of items began to be reduced. Over the next four years, the more unusual serving pieces were being discontinued, and by 1946, the line's variety of items had been reduced by nearly one third.  Overall sales of the more typical place-setting pieces of Fiesta remained strong and reportedly peaked around 1948.  The popularity of Fiesta was due to its bright colors, durable construction, stylized [[art deco]] shapes and designs, and its promotion through mass marketing. From its first introduction in 1936 and for over a decade, Fiesta products were a widespread fad.  The dinnerware became something of a status symbol for late 1930s and pre-war 1940s middle-class households.{{cn|date=September 2019}}  Today, vintage Fiesta trades briskly on [[auction|auction websites]] and at other antique/vintage product sales venues.\n\n==1936\u20131969==\nThe line name and design is still owned by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] of [[Newell, West Virginia|Newell]], [[West Virginia]], which was the original company that produced and marketed it. Except for minor adjustments due to manufacturing requirements, the design of the original shapes remained virtually unchanged from 1936 to 1969.  As home decorating color styles changed, the company changed the solid color glazes.  The texture of the original glazes, and throughout the life of vintage Fiesta, was semi-opaque.  This is smooth and glossy, but without any shining glare, rather more like an eggshell.  The ware sometimes shows \" glaze curtains\", areas of uneven glazing where a heavy application meets a lighter one.\n\nAt its introduction in 1936, Fiesta was produced in five colors: Red (orange red), Blue (cobalt), Green (light green), Yellow (deep golden), and Old Ivory (yellowish cream). By 1938, two years into production, a sixth color was added: Turquoise ([[American robin|robin]]'s egg blue). With the exception of the Red, this color assortment remained in production until approximately 1950. The original Red had been discontinued before 1944 (see below).\n\nThe discontinuation of red, plus the general changes in society due to the United States' participation in World War II, caused a slump in sales of the larger serving pieces from the early 1940s. Prior to this reduction in the number of shapes offered, only one or two very specialized shapes had been discontinued and those by 1938. These early discontinued items, such as covered onion soup bowls in turquoise glaze and mixing bowl covers in any color, are today quite rare.\n\nBy 1950, home decorating styles and colors had changed.  The Homer Laughlin Company discontinued some original glaze colors and replaced them with four new colors.  The original Blue (cobalt), the original Green (light green), and the original Old Ivory (yellowish cream) were discontinued, replaced by Rose (dark pink), Gray (medium), Forest (dark green), and Chartreuse (bright yellowish green).  Two existing glaze colors, Yellow and Turquoise, were retained, allowing the company to offer six colors through the 1950s.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, sales had again dropped.  The company reduced its offering of items and changed the glaze colors.  By 1959 the United States government had released its block on [[uranium]], which enabled the Homer Laughlin Company to produce the original bright orange-red glaze again (see below). The company discontinued the four new glazes of the previous decade in favor of a new green color and the re-introduced original bright orange-red color, which along with the yellow and turquoise colors made up the four glaze colors offered from 1959 through 1969.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough the company always referred to the new color simply as Green in its brochures, collectors later called it Medium Green, to distinguish it from other green glazes which the company had produced.  The Medium Green is a bright, almost Kelly green.  Some have described it as a \"[[List of John Deere tractors|John Deere Tractor]]\" green.  Beginning in 1959, Fiesta was available in the following colors: Red (original orange red), Green (new Medium green), Yellow (original golden), and Turquoise (original robin's egg blue).{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough this color assortment was available and sold for ten years (1959\u20131969), the popularity of Fiesta had fallen.  The newest shade of green is in very short supply{{according to whom?|date=September 2019}} on the secondary market relative to the other glaze colors.  It has gained almost mythical status and, for certain pieces in this glaze, commands astronomical prices wholly disproportionate to the rest of the line.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Yellow glaze is the one glaze that was in production throughout the life of vintage Fiesta. Turquoise, while not strictly an original color (having been introduced about a year into Fiesta's production) was otherwise also in continuous production until the end of the original vintage era in 1969. Red, while an original color at the line's introduction, was removed from the market before 1944 (see below).  Although it was brought back into production from 1959 to 1969, this was after most of the unusual serving pieces had long been discontinued.  Red pieces also usually command a premium price in the secondary market, both for its vibrancy in the mix of colors and for its scarcity due to limited years of production.  While many collectors love all the colors, some only want those of the \"Original 6\" or \"Fifties Colors\".\n\n==Radioactive glazes==\n[[File:FiestaWare Velleman-K2645 GeigerCounter.ogv|thumb|right|[[Geiger counter]] (kit without housing) audibly reacting to an orange Fiestaware shard.]]\n\nBrilliant red Fiesta (and indeed the red glazes produced by all U.S. potteries of the era) is known for having a detectable amount of [[uranium oxide]] in its [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], which produced the orange-red [[color]].<ref>''Radon, Health and Natural Hazards'', Editors: G.K.

The anchor narrating the segment passes a radiation measuring tool over several products including the Antique/Vintage Fiesta plate that was produced nearly 70 years ago. The narrator also stated that it was taken off the market because when people heard about the uranium in the glaze, they did not want to buy the product. In fact, The Homer Laughlin China Company stopped manufacturing all Fiestaware in 1972 because of low sales. The product that was used within the segment has been discontinued and has not available for close to 40 years time. Fiesta today is frequently tested by federally licensed independent laboratories and is lead free, microwave/dishwasher safe, oven proof and made in the USA ...\n \nPrior to World War II, it was common practice for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in color glazes. The Homer Laughlin China Company was no exception, using this material in the original \"Fiesta Red\" glaze, among others.\n \nIn 1943, the U.S. Government stopped all civilian use of uranium oxide because available supplies were needed for the war effort. Homer Laughlin stopped producing the red glaze color at that time and for that reason. Nonetheless, this interruption in production is believed to be the source of the rumor that Fiesta's red glaze was removed from the market because it was radioactive. In truth, the red glaze emitted far less radiation than some other consumer products. Following the lifting of wartime restrictions, Homer Laughlin again began producing the red glaze in the 1950s, using a depleted grade of uranium oxide.\n \nHomer Laughlin stopped all use of depleted uranium oxide in 1972 and it is not used in Fiesta Dinnerware which is produced today.}}\n\n==1969\u20131973==\nBy 1969 home decorating tastes had again changed.  The company restyled the shapes of Fiesta to try to modernize it.  Finials on covers, handles on cups, bowl contours and shapes, were all modified to give Fiesta a more contemporary appearance.  The glaze colors were also changed, with the choices being limited to three colors for the place-setting pieces, and one color for the five major serving pieces.  These were the remainder of the 64-piece assortment of shapes. Although essentially the same Red glaze as had then been available since 1959, it was renamed Mango Red.  Replacing  Yellow, Turquoise, and Medium Green, were two new glaze colors. One was Turf Green, which nearly matched the popular [[Avocado]] color of the day.  The second color was Antique Gold, a brownish-yellow which nearly matched the popular Harvest Gold of the era.  The line's name was changed to \"Fiesta Ironstone\".  The shape redesigns and color changes did not restore Fiesta's  popularity, and in January 1973 the company discontinued the Fiesta line.\n\n==Decaled and decorated Fiesta shapes==\nAs is common with many dinnerware shapes, the manufacturers add different decals to the shapes and give them new names.  Throughout its long life (1936\u20131973), the item shapes of Fiesta were often decorated with decals and marketed under other names, or a name variation.  One example was \"Fiesta Casuals\", which consisted of two patterns, one with yellow and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta yellow items, the other with turquoise and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta turquoise items.\n\nAs another example, in the late 1960s, the shapes of Fiesta were glazed in a dark 'bean-pot' brown, flat pieces were given an underglaze 'Mediterranean-style' geometric decal in black, and the line was marketed as \"Amberstone\" in a supermarket promotion.  Later these shapes were glazed in Antique Gold, with a different stylized pattern under the glaze.  This line was dubbed \"Casualstone\" for another supermarket promotion.\n\n==Collectors and the secondary market==\nDuring the 1970s, a new appreciation for [[Art Deco]] designs from the 1920s and 1930s flourished. Along with this, the [[baby boomers]] were establishing their own households.  They made Fiesta popular once again.  Almost immediately after Fiesta was discontinued in January 1973, collectors began buying heavily in second-hand shops and the newly popular [[garage sale]]s. Another avenue for acquiring pieces, and sometimes entire collections, was through local auctions.  Due to the enormous popularity of Fiesta in the secondary market, its prices skyrocketed.  By the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Fiesta items once costing pennies were commanding nearly a hundred U.S. [[dollar]]s for scarcer items.  By the mid-1980s, prices had climbed higher.  Certain pieces and colors were being traded for hundreds of dollars.\n\n==Contemporary Fiesta from 1986 ==\n[[File:Fiesta ware fiesta.jpg|thumb|A display of Fiesta]]\nThe [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] noticed the activity on the secondary market.  After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction.  Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969\u20131973). The company then changed the body to a fully vitrified clay, to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable.  Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay.  Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully vitrified clay body) are noticeably smaller.  In addition to redesigns, new shapes were added to the line.\n\nIn 1986, Laughlin offered five colors:\n*Rose (pink) (1986\u20132005) [This color changed significantly in the post-2000 firings but was still considered the same Rose],\n*Black (black) (1986\u20132015),\n*Cobalt (dark navy blue) (1986\u2013),\n*White (bright stark white) (1986\u2013),\n*Apricot (pale pinkish tan) (1986\u20131998).\n\nThe glaze texture on this new Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much shinier than the original Fiesta.  Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular.  In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines.  Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers.  Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying from the new assortment.  Early in Fiesta's second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new [[collectible]].  The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the  collectors' market over the past 20 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or controlling production time frames.  Similar techniques have been used by numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.<ref>Curtis, Wayne. \"[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/2/2004_2_66.shtml China Town]\" ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', April/May 2004.</ref>\n\nLaughlin has produced new Fiesta in a total of 34 glaze colors, none of which matches exactly any of the thirteen colors of vintage Fiesta.  As of early 2008, many Fiesta shapes exist in a total of 39 color [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]s.  In addition to the first five glazes, the names of the new color glazes, in order of introduction, are:\n*Yellow (pale custard/butter) (1987\u20132002),\n*Turquoise (more greenish than vintage Turquoise) (1988\u2013),\n*Periwinkle (slightly lavenderish-blue) (1989\u20132006),\n*Sea Mist (pale mint green) (1991\u20132005),\n*Lilac (soft purple) (1993\u20131995),\n*Persimmon (pinkish-orange) (1995\u20132008),\n*Sapphire (medium bright blue) (Bloomingdale's exclusive 1996\u20131997),\n*Chartreuse (brighter and greener than vintage Chartreuse) (1997\u20131999),\n*Pearl Gray (light gray) (1999\u20132001),\n*Juniper (dark bluish-green) (1999\u20132001),\n*Cinnabar (brownish-burgundy) (2000\u20132010),\n*Sunflower (bright yellow) (2001\u2013),\n*Plum (dark purple) (2002\u20132016),\n*Shamrock (bright deep green) (2002\u2013),\n*Tangerine (bright orange) (2003\u20132018),\n*Scarlet (deep true red) (2004\u2013),\n*Peacock (bright blue) (2005\u20132015),\n*Heather (dark reddish-purple) (2006\u20132009), \n*Evergreen (dark green) (2007\u20132009),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/evergreenrelease.htm Evergreen Release 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Ivory (egg shell/off white) (2008\u2013),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/ivoryrelease.htm Ivory Release 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Chocolate (brown) (2008\u20132012),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/chocolaterelease.htm Chocolate Release 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Lemongrass (yellowish chartreuse) (2009\u2013),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/lemongrassrelease.htm Lemongrass Release 2009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Paprika (dark rust) (2010\u20132017),<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/notes/homer-laughlin-china/the-new-2010-fiestar-color-ispaprika/395032000165 Paprika Release 2010<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Marigold (yellowish-orange), HLC's 75th Anniversary Fiesta color - limited 75-week run (2011\u20132012)<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Marigold Release 2011<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Flamingo (light salmon pink) (2012\u20132013),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eatnlisten.com/2012/03/28/fiesta-dinnerware-new-flamingo-color-homer-laughlin-china-dinnerware/ |title=Flamingo Release<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2012-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331053800/http://www.eatnlisten.com/2012/03/28/fiesta-dinnerware-new-flamingo-color-homer-laughlin-china-dinnerware/ |archive-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Lapis (denim blue) (2013\u2013), announced March 2, 2013<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Homer-Laughlin-China/68478260109?id=68478260109&sk=app_344049209045098 Lapis Release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Poppy (bright reddish-orange) (2014\u2013), announced March 15, 2014<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Homer-Laughlin-China/68478260109?hc_location=timeline]</ref>\n*Sage (earthy green) (2015\u20132019), announced March 7, 2015<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\">[http://alwaysfestive.com/2015/03/2015-new-colors/]</ref>\n*Slate (charcoal gray) (2015\u2013), announced March 7, 2015<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Claret (red wine) (2016\u20132018), announced March 5, 2016<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Daffodil (vibrant golden yellow) (2017\u2013), announced January 10, 2017<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Mulberry (deep purple) (2018\u2013), announced January 9, 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/homerlaughlinchina/photos/a.76045405109.110619.68478260109/10156462172275110/?type=3&theater|title=Fiesta Dinnerware|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n*Meadow (deep mint green) (2019\u2013), announced January 8, 2019<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Butterscotch (orange yellow) (2020\u2013), announced January 12, 2020<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n\n===Special edition colors===\nSince the reintroduction of Fiesta in 1986, Homer Laughlin has introduced three colors that were available for two years: Lilac (1993\u20131995), Chartreuse (1997\u20131999) and Juniper (1999\u20132001).  Sapphire was sold exclusively at [[Bloomingdale's]] from 1996 to 1997.  In November 2008, Homer Laughlin released the limited-edition color, Chocolate.  The color of [[milk chocolate]], the new shade adds a second neutral tone to Fiesta's color palette.  It was available for a limited period of time and in a limited number of pieces.\n\nIn 1997, 500 limited-edition presentation bowls in an exclusive Raspberry (reddish maroon) colored glaze were made to commemorate the production of the 500 millionth piece of [[dinnerware]] carrying the name Fiesta produced by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] since 1936.  In anticipation of Fiesta's 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold.  In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in [[Chicago]], Illinois.  This was followed by the introduction of a large serving platter in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen.  Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011\u20132012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Fiesta 75th Anniversary!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs an indication of its influence, Fiestaware was featured in a design exhibit at the [[Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum in [[New York City]] in 1988.\n\n===Square Fiesta dinnerware===\nIn 2009, a new line of square Fiesta dinnerware was introduced.  Square is available as dinner, luncheon and salad plates, 19 oz. bowls and mugs, four-piece place settings, as well as a full line of accessories. \nDespite square silhouettes, pieces maintain a strong relationship to the company's established 'round' deco offering; coupe shape and height remain the same, along with the brand's signature concentric rings.\n\nIn October 2016, Fiesta announced the discontinuation of the square bowl (992) and the square mug (923).\n<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/squarerelease.htm Square Fiesta Dinnerware<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n''[[American Fiesta]]'', a one-man play written and performed by [[Steven Tomlinsoni]], refers to the central character's obsession with collecting vintage Fiesta dinnerware.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite news\n  | title = A Nation Bound by Colorful Dinnerware\n  | publisher = The New York Times, Ginia Bellafante, April 28, 2007\n  | url = http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/theater/reviews/28fies.html\n| date=April 28, 2007\n| accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bauer Pottery]]\n*[[Franciscan Ceramics]]\n*[[Metlox]]\n*[[Pacific Clay]]\n*[[Sencer Sari]]\n*[[Uranium glass]]\n*[[Uranium tile]]\n*[[Vernon Kilns]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Rowe, Willyum.

However, Fiesta was the first widely mass-promoted and marketed solid-color [[dinnerware]] in the US.\n\nWhen it was introduced, the decoration of [[dinnerware]] and [[kitchenware]] [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] was still inspired by the [[Victorian era]], based on full, predetermined sets of dinnerware, all decorated with the same [[decal]] designs.  With its solid color glazes and mix-and-match concept, Fiesta represented something radically new to the general public. The forms and surfaces expressed an [[Art Deco]] influence. At introduction, the Fiesta line of dinnerware comprised some 37 different pieces, including such occasional pieces as candle holders in two designs, a bud vase, and an ash tray.  A set of seven nested mixing bowls ranged in size, from the smallest at five inches in diameter up to a nearly twelve-inch diameter.<ref name=huxford/>  The company sold basic table service sets for four, six and eight persons, made up of the usual dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, and cup and saucer.  But, the promotion and presentation of Fiesta from the start was as a line of open-stock items from which the individual purchaser could choose to combine serving and place pieces by personal preference and need.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAs an early Homer Laughlin Company brochure said:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n<blockquote>\"COLOR!  that's the trend today ...\" and it went on to say, \"It gives the hostess the opportunity to create her own table effects ... Plates of one color, Cream Soups of another, contrasting Cups and Saucers ... it's FUN to set a table with Fiesta!\" </blockquote>\n\nThe Homer Laughlin Company quickly added several additional items to the line. During this period some items were modified, and several items were eliminated, including the covered onion soup bowl, and the mixing bowl covers. In the years up to 1940, the line was expanded by the production of more new items.  At its most numerous, the Fiesta line comprised approximately 64 different items, including flower [[vase]]s in three sizes, divided plates, water tumblers, [[Decanter|carafes]], [[teapot]]s in two sizes, five part relish trays, and large chop plates in fifteen-inch and thirteen-inch diameters.  In addition, it offered several unique promotional items for one dollar each, available only in a predetermined glaze color.\n\nWith [[World War II]] and the need for manufacturers to focus on production for that effort, non-war related production and public demand declined.  Beginning in 1942, the Fiesta line of items began to be reduced. Over the next four years, the more unusual serving pieces were being discontinued, and by 1946, the line's variety of items had been reduced by nearly one third.  Overall sales of the more typical place-setting pieces of Fiesta remained strong and reportedly peaked around 1948.  The popularity of Fiesta was due to its bright colors, durable construction, stylized [[art deco]] shapes and designs, and its promotion through mass marketing. From its first introduction in 1936 and for over a decade, Fiesta products were a widespread fad.  The dinnerware became something of a status symbol for late 1930s and pre-war 1940s middle-class households.{{cn|date=September 2019}}  Today, vintage Fiesta trades briskly on [[auction|auction websites]] and at other antique/vintage product sales venues.\n\n==1936\u20131969==\nThe line name and design is still owned by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] of [[Newell, West Virginia|Newell]], [[West Virginia]], which was the original company that produced and marketed it. Except for minor adjustments due to manufacturing requirements, the design of the original shapes remained virtually unchanged from 1936 to 1969.  As home decorating color styles changed, the company changed the solid color glazes.  The texture of the original glazes, and throughout the life of vintage Fiesta, was semi-opaque.  This is smooth and glossy, but without any shining glare, rather more like an eggshell.  The ware sometimes shows \" glaze curtains\", areas of uneven glazing where a heavy application meets a lighter one.\n\nAt its introduction in 1936, Fiesta was produced in five colors: Red (orange red), Blue (cobalt), Green (light green), Yellow (deep golden), and Old Ivory (yellowish cream). By 1938, two years into production, a sixth color was added: Turquoise ([[American robin|robin]]'s egg blue). With the exception of the Red, this color assortment remained in production until approximately 1950. The original Red had been discontinued before 1944 (see below).\n\nThe discontinuation of red, plus the general changes in society due to the United States' participation in World War II, caused a slump in sales of the larger serving pieces from the early 1940s. Prior to this reduction in the number of shapes offered, only one or two very specialized shapes had been discontinued and those by 1938. These early discontinued items, such as covered onion soup bowls in turquoise glaze and mixing bowl covers in any color, are today quite rare.\n\nBy 1950, home decorating styles and colors had changed.  The Homer Laughlin Company discontinued some original glaze colors and replaced them with four new colors.  The original Blue (cobalt), the original Green (light green), and the original Old Ivory (yellowish cream) were discontinued, replaced by Rose (dark pink), Gray (medium), Forest (dark green), and Chartreuse (bright yellowish green).  Two existing glaze colors, Yellow and Turquoise, were retained, allowing the company to offer six colors through the 1950s.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, sales had again dropped.  The company reduced its offering of items and changed the glaze colors.  By 1959 the United States government had released its block on [[uranium]], which enabled the Homer Laughlin Company to produce the original bright orange-red glaze again (see below). The company discontinued the four new glazes of the previous decade in favor of a new green color and the re-introduced original bright orange-red color, which along with the yellow and turquoise colors made up the four glaze colors offered from 1959 through 1969.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough the company always referred to the new color simply as Green in its brochures, collectors later called it Medium Green, to distinguish it from other green glazes which the company had produced.  The Medium Green is a bright, almost Kelly green.  Some have described it as a \"[[List of John Deere tractors|John Deere Tractor]]\" green.  Beginning in 1959, Fiesta was available in the following colors: Red (original orange red), Green (new Medium green), Yellow (original golden), and Turquoise (original robin's egg blue).{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough this color assortment was available and sold for ten years (1959\u20131969), the popularity of Fiesta had fallen.  The newest shade of green is in very short supply{{according to whom?|date=September 2019}} on the secondary market relative to the other glaze colors.  It has gained almost mythical status and, for certain pieces in this glaze, commands astronomical prices wholly disproportionate to the rest of the line.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Yellow glaze is the one glaze that was in production throughout the life of vintage Fiesta. Turquoise, while not strictly an original color (having been introduced about a year into Fiesta's production) was otherwise also in continuous production until the end of the original vintage era in 1969. Red, while an original color at the line's introduction, was removed from the market before 1944 (see below).  Although it was brought back into production from 1959 to 1969, this was after most of the unusual serving pieces had long been discontinued.  Red pieces also usually command a premium price in the secondary market, both for its vibrancy in the mix of colors and for its scarcity due to limited years of production.  While many collectors love all the colors, some only want those of the \"Original 6\" or \"Fifties Colors\".\n\n==Radioactive glazes==\n[[File:FiestaWare Velleman-K2645 GeigerCounter.ogv|thumb|right|[[Geiger counter]] (kit without housing) audibly reacting to an orange Fiestaware shard.]]\n\nBrilliant red Fiesta (and indeed the red glazes produced by all U.S. potteries of the era) is known for having a detectable amount of [[uranium oxide]] in its [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], which produced the orange-red [[color]].<ref>''Radon, Health and Natural Hazards'', Editors: G.K.

The anchor narrating the segment passes a radiation measuring tool over several products including the Antique/Vintage Fiesta plate that was produced nearly 70 years ago. The narrator also stated that it was taken off the market because when people heard about the uranium in the glaze, they did not want to buy the product. In fact, The Homer Laughlin China Company stopped manufacturing all Fiestaware in 1972 because of low sales. The product that was used within the segment has been discontinued and has not available for close to 40 years time. Fiesta today is frequently tested by federally licensed independent laboratories and is lead free, microwave/dishwasher safe, oven proof and made in the USA ...\n \nPrior to World War II, it was common practice for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in color glazes. The Homer Laughlin China Company was no exception, using this material in the original \"Fiesta Red\" glaze, among others.\n \nIn 1943, the U.S. Government stopped all civilian use of uranium oxide because available supplies were needed for the war effort. Homer Laughlin stopped producing the red glaze color at that time and for that reason. Nonetheless, this interruption in production is believed to be the source of the rumor that Fiesta's red glaze was removed from the market because it was radioactive. In truth, the red glaze emitted far less radiation than some other consumer products. Following the lifting of wartime restrictions, Homer Laughlin again began producing the red glaze in the 1950s, using a depleted grade of uranium oxide.\n \nHomer Laughlin stopped all use of depleted uranium oxide in 1972 and it is not used in Fiesta Dinnerware which is produced today.}}\n\n==1969\u20131973==\nBy 1969 home decorating tastes had again changed.  The company restyled the shapes of Fiesta to try to modernize it.  Finials on covers, handles on cups, bowl contours and shapes, were all modified to give Fiesta a more contemporary appearance.  The glaze colors were also changed, with the choices being limited to three colors for the place-setting pieces, and one color for the five major serving pieces.  These were the remainder of the 64-piece assortment of shapes. Although essentially the same Red glaze as had then been available since 1959, it was renamed Mango Red.  Replacing  Yellow, Turquoise, and Medium Green, were two new glaze colors. One was Turf Green, which nearly matched the popular [[Avocado]] color of the day.  The second color was Antique Gold, a brownish-yellow which nearly matched the popular Harvest Gold of the era.  The line's name was changed to \"Fiesta Ironstone\".  The shape redesigns and color changes did not restore Fiesta's  popularity, and in January 1973 the company discontinued the Fiesta line.\n\n==Decaled and decorated Fiesta shapes==\nAs is common with many dinnerware shapes, the manufacturers add different decals to the shapes and give them new names.  Throughout its long life (1936\u20131973), the item shapes of Fiesta were often decorated with decals and marketed under other names, or a name variation.  One example was \"Fiesta Casuals\", which consisted of two patterns, one with yellow and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta yellow items, the other with turquoise and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta turquoise items.\n\nAs another example, in the late 1960s, the shapes of Fiesta were glazed in a dark 'bean-pot' brown, flat pieces were given an underglaze 'Mediterranean-style' geometric decal in black, and the line was marketed as \"Amberstone\" in a supermarket promotion.  Later these shapes were glazed in Antique Gold, with a different stylized pattern under the glaze.  This line was dubbed \"Casualstone\" for another supermarket promotion.\n\n==Collectors and the secondary market==\nDuring the 1970s, a new appreciation for [[Art Deco]] designs from the 1920s and 1930s flourished. Along with this, the [[baby boomers]] were establishing their own households.  They made Fiesta popular once again.  Almost immediately after Fiesta was discontinued in January 1973, collectors began buying heavily in second-hand shops and the newly popular [[garage sale]]s. Another avenue for acquiring pieces, and sometimes entire collections, was through local auctions.  Due to the enormous popularity of Fiesta in the secondary market, its prices skyrocketed.  By the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Fiesta items once costing pennies were commanding nearly a hundred U.S. [[dollar]]s for scarcer items.  By the mid-1980s, prices had climbed higher.  Certain pieces and colors were being traded for hundreds of dollars.\n\n==Contemporary Fiesta from 1986 ==\n[[File:Fiesta ware fiesta.jpg|thumb|A display of Fiesta]]\nThe [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] noticed the activity on the secondary market.  After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction.  Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969\u20131973). The company then changed the body to a fully vitrified clay, to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable.  Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay.  Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully vitrified clay body) are noticeably smaller.  In addition to redesigns, new shapes were added to the line.\n\nIn 1986, Laughlin offered five colors:\n*Rose (pink) (1986\u20132005) [This color changed significantly in the post-2000 firings but was still considered the same Rose],\n*Black (black) (1986\u20132015),\n*Cobalt (dark navy blue) (1986\u2013),\n*White (bright stark white) (1986\u2013),\n*Apricot (pale pinkish tan) (1986\u20131998).\n\nThe glaze texture on this new Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much shinier than the original Fiesta.  Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular.  In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines.  Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers.  Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying from the new assortment.  Early in Fiesta's second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new [[collectible]].  The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the  collectors' market over the past 20 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or controlling production time frames.  Similar techniques have been used by numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.<ref>Curtis, Wayne. \"[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/2/2004_2_66.shtml China Town]\" ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', April/May 2004.</ref>\n\nLaughlin has produced new Fiesta in a total of 34 glaze colors, none of which matches exactly any of the thirteen colors of vintage Fiesta.  As of early 2008, many Fiesta shapes exist in a total of 39 color [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]s.  In addition to the first five glazes, the names of the new color glazes, in order of introduction, are:\n*Yellow (pale custard/butter) (1987\u20132002),\n*Turquoise (more greenish than vintage Turquoise) (1988\u2013),\n*Periwinkle (slightly lavenderish-blue) (1989\u20132006),\n*Sea Mist (pale mint green) (1991\u20132005),\n*Lilac (soft purple) (1993\u20131995),\n*Persimmon (pinkish-orange) (1995\u20132008),\n*Sapphire (medium bright blue) (Bloomingdale's exclusive 1996\u20131997),\n*Chartreuse (brighter and greener than vintage Chartreuse) (1997\u20131999),\n*Pearl Gray (light gray) (1999\u20132001),\n*Juniper (dark bluish-green) (1999\u20132001),\n*Cinnabar (brownish-burgundy) (2000\u20132010),\n*Sunflower (bright yellow) (2001\u2013),\n*Plum (dark purple) (2002\u20132016),\n*Shamrock (bright deep green) (2002\u2013),\n*Tangerine (bright orange) (2003\u20132018),\n*Scarlet (deep true red) (2004\u2013),\n*Peacock (bright blue) (2005\u20132015),\n*Heather (dark reddish-purple) (2006\u20132009), \n*Evergreen (dark green) (2007\u20132009),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/evergreenrelease.htm Evergreen Release 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Ivory (egg shell/off white) (2008\u2013),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/ivoryrelease.htm Ivory Release 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Chocolate (brown) (2008\u20132012),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/chocolaterelease.htm Chocolate Release 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Lemongrass (yellowish chartreuse) (2009\u2013),<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/lemongrassrelease.htm Lemongrass Release 2009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Paprika (dark rust) (2010\u20132017),<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/notes/homer-laughlin-china/the-new-2010-fiestar-color-ispaprika/395032000165 Paprika Release 2010<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Marigold (yellowish-orange), HLC's 75th Anniversary Fiesta color - limited 75-week run (2011\u20132012)<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Marigold Release 2011<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Flamingo (light salmon pink) (2012\u20132013),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eatnlisten.com/2012/03/28/fiesta-dinnerware-new-flamingo-color-homer-laughlin-china-dinnerware/ |title=Flamingo Release<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2012-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331053800/http://www.eatnlisten.com/2012/03/28/fiesta-dinnerware-new-flamingo-color-homer-laughlin-china-dinnerware/ |archive-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Lapis (denim blue) (2013\u2013), announced March 2, 2013<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Homer-Laughlin-China/68478260109?id=68478260109&sk=app_344049209045098 Lapis Release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Poppy (bright reddish-orange) (2014\u2013), announced March 15, 2014<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Homer-Laughlin-China/68478260109?hc_location=timeline]</ref>\n*Sage (earthy green) (2015\u20132019), announced March 7, 2015<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\">[http://alwaysfestive.com/2015/03/2015-new-colors/]</ref>\n*Slate (charcoal gray) (2015\u2013), announced March 7, 2015<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Claret (red wine) (2016\u20132018), announced March 5, 2016<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Daffodil (vibrant golden yellow) (2017\u2013), announced January 10, 2017<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Mulberry (deep purple) (2018\u2013), announced January 9, 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/homerlaughlinchina/photos/a.76045405109.110619.68478260109/10156462172275110/?type=3&theater|title=Fiesta Dinnerware|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n*Meadow (deep mint green) (2019\u2013), announced January 8, 2019<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n*Butterscotch (orange yellow) (2020\u2013), announced January 12, 2020<ref name=\"alwaysfestive.com\"/>\n\n===Special edition colors===\nSince the reintroduction of Fiesta in 1986, Homer Laughlin has introduced three colors that were available for two years: Lilac (1993\u20131995), Chartreuse (1997\u20131999) and Juniper (1999\u20132001).  Sapphire was sold exclusively at [[Bloomingdale's]] from 1996 to 1997.  In November 2008, Homer Laughlin released the limited-edition color, Chocolate.  The color of [[milk chocolate]], the new shade adds a second neutral tone to Fiesta's color palette.  It was available for a limited period of time and in a limited number of pieces.\n\nIn 1997, 500 limited-edition presentation bowls in an exclusive Raspberry (reddish maroon) colored glaze were made to commemorate the production of the 500 millionth piece of [[dinnerware]] carrying the name Fiesta produced by the [[Homer Laughlin China Company]] since 1936.  In anticipation of Fiesta's 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold.  In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in [[Chicago]], Illinois.  This was followed by the introduction of a large serving platter in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen.  Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011\u20132012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/marigoldrelease.htm Fiesta 75th Anniversary!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs an indication of its influence, Fiestaware was featured in a design exhibit at the [[Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum in [[New York City]] in 1988.\n\n===Square Fiesta dinnerware===\nIn 2009, a new line of square Fiesta dinnerware was introduced.  Square is available as dinner, luncheon and salad plates, 19 oz. bowls and mugs, four-piece place settings, as well as a full line of accessories. \nDespite square silhouettes, pieces maintain a strong relationship to the company's established 'round' deco offering; coupe shape and height remain the same, along with the brand's signature concentric rings.\n\nIn October 2016, Fiesta announced the discontinuation of the square bowl (992) and the square mug (923).\n<ref>[http://www.hlchina.com/squarerelease.htm Square Fiesta Dinnerware<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n''[[American Fiesta]]'', a one-man play written and performed by [[Steven Tomlinsoni]], refers to the central character's obsession with collecting vintage Fiesta dinnerware.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite news\n  | title = A Nation Bound by Colorful Dinnerware\n  | publisher = The New York Times, Ginia Bellafante, April 28, 2007\n  | url = http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/theater/reviews/28fies.html\n| date=April 28, 2007\n| accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bauer Pottery]]\n*[[Franciscan Ceramics]]\n*[[Metlox]]\n*[[Pacific Clay]]\n*[[Sencer Sari]]\n*[[Uranium glass]]\n*[[Uranium tile]]\n*[[Vernon Kilns]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Rowe, Willyum.

The screenplay was written by [[Dan Sterling]], based on a story he co-wrote with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and [[James Franco]] as journalists who set up an interview with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] ([[Randall Park]]), and are then recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to assassinate him. The film is heavily inspired by a 2012 ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary.\n\nRogen and Goldberg developed the idea for ''The Interview'' in the late 2000s, with [[Kim Jong-il]] as the original assassination target. In 2011, after [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Jong-il's death]] and Jong-un's succession as the [[List of heads of state of North Korea|North Korean leader]], Rogen and Goldberg redeveloped the script with the focus on Jong-un's character. ''The Interview'' was first announced in March 2013, at the beginning of pre-production. [[Principal photography]] was in [[Vancouver]] from October to December 2013. The film was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[LStar Capital]] and Rogen and Goldberg's [[Point Grey Pictures]], and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn June 2014, the North Korean government threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. As a result, Sony delayed the release from October to December and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more acceptable to North Korea. In November, the computer systems of Sony were [[Sony Pictures hack|hacked]] by the \"Guardians of Peace\", a group the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] claimed has ties to North Korea.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]] and David Siman-Tov, [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf Cyberspace Extortion: North Korea versus the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031432/http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf |date=August 20, 2016 }}, [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|INSS]] Insight No. 646, December 23, 2014.</ref> The group also threatened terrorist attacks against theaters showing the film. As a result, major theater chains opted not to release the film, and Sony instead released it for online digital rental and purchase on December 24, 2014, followed by a [[limited release]] at selected theaters the next day.\n\nIn December 2014, [[South Korea|South Korean]] singer [[Yoon Mi-rae]] revealed that the film used her song \"Pay Day\" without permission, and that she was taking legal action.<ref name=\"newsmp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.soompi.com/2014/12/26/yoon-mi-rae-to-take-legal-action-against-sony-pictures-for-using-her-song-in-the-interview-without-permission/|title=Yoon Mi Rae to Take Legal Action against Sony Pictures for Using Her Song in \"The Interview\" without Permission|date=27 December 2014|work=Soompi|author=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> Yoon Mi-rae and her label [[Feel Ghood Music]] reached a settlement with Sony Pictures Entertainment on the 13th of May 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/201343/20150517/sony-the-interview-yoon-mi-rae-payday.htm|title=Sony And Yoon Mi Rae Reach Settlement Over Unlicensed Song Usage In 'The Interview'|website=KpopStarz|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> \n\n''The Interview'' grossed $40 million in digital rentals, making it Sony's most successful digital release and earned an additional $12.3 million worldwide in box office ticket sales on a $44 million budget. It received mixed reviews for its humor and subject matter, although a few critics praised the performances of Rogen, Franco, Park and [[Diana Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\nDave Skylark is the host of the [[talk show]] ''Skylark Tonight'', where he interviews various celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Later, Skylark discovers that [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] is a fan of ''Skylark Tonight'', prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Rapaport travels to a place outside [[Dandong]], [[China]] to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, a [[Propaganda in North Korea|propaganda minister]], and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim on behalf of Skylark.\n\nThe next day, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Lacey shows up at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a [[transdermal patch|transdermal strip]] that will poison Kim with [[ricin]] via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the [[Residences of North Korean leaders|presidential palace]] in [[Pyongyang]], they are introduced to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more patches from a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], but in order to smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a [[Siberian tiger]] and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.\n\nSkylark spends the day with Kim by playing [[basketball]], hanging out and partying together. Kim persuades Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally shoots Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strip, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he [[Korean conflict|threatens war]] against [[South Korea]] and everyone who try to undermine his leadership. Skylark leaves and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely [[Potemkin village|fake]] and realizes that Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempted sex with Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip in his hand), Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark, Rapaport and Sook-yin plan to break [[North Korean cult of personality|Kim's cult of personality]] by causing him to cry on air. Before the broadcast starts, Kim gives Skylark a puppy as a gift to keep.\n\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's [[North Korean famine|food shortage]] issues and [[Sanctions against North Korea|economic sanctions]] imposed by the US) and challenges Kim's need for [[Kim Jong-il|his father]]'s approval. Meanwhile, Sook-yin and Rapaport seize control of the broadcasting center and attack guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably and soils himself after Skylark sings [[Firework (song)|\"Firework\"]] by [[Katy Perry]] (having learned of Kim's fondness of Perry earlier), ruining his reputation. Betrayed and humiliated, Kim shoots Skylark (who survives due to a bulletproof vest) and goes into a violent rage, vowing to get his revenge. Skylark then regroups with Rapaport and Sook-yin to escape the presidential palace with the puppy in tow. After a security guard helps them escape, the trio hijack Kim's [[T-54/T-55|personal tank]] to get to their pickup point. Kim boards a helicopter and attacks the group alongside his army. He prepares a nuclear missile launch, but before he can issue the command to launch, Skylark shoots down Kim's helicopter, killing him. \n\nWith the immediate threat over, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route where they are rescued and loaded onto a rescue craft by [[SEAL Team Six]] members disguised as [[Korean People's Army]] troops, while Sook goes to [[Pyongyang]] to ensure political stability. Back in the United States, Skylark writes a book about his experience while North Korea become a [[denuclearization|denuclearized]] [[democracy]] with Sook-yin as an [[Transitional government|interim leader]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franco]] as Dave Skylark\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Aaron Rapaport\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Agent Lacey\n* [[Randall Park]] as [[Kim Jong-un]]\n* [[Diana Bang]] as Sook-yin Park\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Malcolm\n<!-- these are listed after the main six in the longer closing credits -->\n* Reese Alexander as Agent Botwin\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Jake\n* [[Charles Chun|Charles Rahi Chun]] as General Jong\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as Daryl\n<!-- ones listed after here were minor characters such as Two-Fingered Man, Train Passengers, Korean Girl, Hot Korean Girls, Drone Pilot, etc. -->\n\nThe film also features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Eminem]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Seth Meyers]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Williams]] and [[Scott Pelley]].

The screenplay was written by [[Dan Sterling]], based on a story he co-wrote with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and [[James Franco]] as journalists who set up an interview with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] ([[Randall Park]]), and are then recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to assassinate him. The film is heavily inspired by a 2012 ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary.\n\nRogen and Goldberg developed the idea for ''The Interview'' in the late 2000s, with [[Kim Jong-il]] as the original assassination target. In 2011, after [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Jong-il's death]] and Jong-un's succession as the [[List of heads of state of North Korea|North Korean leader]], Rogen and Goldberg redeveloped the script with the focus on Jong-un's character. ''The Interview'' was first announced in March 2013, at the beginning of pre-production. [[Principal photography]] was in [[Vancouver]] from October to December 2013. The film was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[LStar Capital]] and Rogen and Goldberg's [[Point Grey Pictures]], and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn June 2014, the North Korean government threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. As a result, Sony delayed the release from October to December and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more acceptable to North Korea. In November, the computer systems of Sony were [[Sony Pictures hack|hacked]] by the \"Guardians of Peace\", a group the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] claimed has ties to North Korea.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]] and David Siman-Tov, [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf Cyberspace Extortion: North Korea versus the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031432/http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf |date=August 20, 2016 }}, [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|INSS]] Insight No. 646, December 23, 2014.</ref> The group also threatened terrorist attacks against theaters showing the film.

It received mixed reviews for its humor and subject matter, although a few critics praised the performances of Rogen, Franco, Park and [[Diana Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\nDave Skylark is the host of the [[talk show]] ''Skylark Tonight'', where he interviews various celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Later, Skylark discovers that [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] is a fan of ''Skylark Tonight'', prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Rapaport travels to a place outside [[Dandong]], [[China]] to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, a [[Propaganda in North Korea|propaganda minister]], and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim on behalf of Skylark.\n\nThe next day, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Lacey shows up at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a [[transdermal patch|transdermal strip]] that will poison Kim with [[ricin]] via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the [[Residences of North Korean leaders|presidential palace]] in [[Pyongyang]], they are introduced to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more patches from a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], but in order to smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a [[Siberian tiger]] and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.\n\nSkylark spends the day with Kim by playing [[basketball]], hanging out and partying together. Kim persuades Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally shoots Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strip, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he [[Korean conflict|threatens war]] against [[South Korea]] and everyone who try to undermine his leadership. Skylark leaves and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely [[Potemkin village|fake]] and realizes that Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempted sex with Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip in his hand), Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark, Rapaport and Sook-yin plan to break [[North Korean cult of personality|Kim's cult of personality]] by causing him to cry on air. Before the broadcast starts, Kim gives Skylark a puppy as a gift to keep.\n\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's [[North Korean famine|food shortage]] issues and [[Sanctions against North Korea|economic sanctions]] imposed by the US) and challenges Kim's need for [[Kim Jong-il|his father]]'s approval. Meanwhile, Sook-yin and Rapaport seize control of the broadcasting center and attack guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably and soils himself after Skylark sings [[Firework (song)|\"Firework\"]] by [[Katy Perry]] (having learned of Kim's fondness of Perry earlier), ruining his reputation. Betrayed and humiliated, Kim shoots Skylark (who survives due to a bulletproof vest) and goes into a violent rage, vowing to get his revenge. Skylark then regroups with Rapaport and Sook-yin to escape the presidential palace with the puppy in tow. After a security guard help them escape, the trio hijack Kim's [[T-54/T-55|personal tank]] to get to their pickup point. Kim boards a helicopter and attacks the group alongside his army. He prepares a nuclear missile launch, but before he can issue the command to launch, Skylark shoots down Kim's helicopter, killing him. \n\nWith the immediate threat over, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route where they are rescued and loaded onto a rescue craft by [[SEAL Team Six]] members disguised as [[Korean People's Army]] troops, while Sook goes to [[Pyongyang]] to ensure political stability. Back in the United States, Skylark writes a book about his experience while North Korea become a [[denuclearization|denuclearized]] [[democracy]] with Sook-yin as an [[Transitional government|interim leader]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franco]] as Dave Skylark\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Aaron Rapaport\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Agent Lacey\n* [[Randall Park]] as [[Kim Jong-un]]\n* [[Diana Bang]] as Sook-yin Park\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Malcolm\n<!-- these are listed after the main six in the longer closing credits -->\n* Reese Alexander as Agent Botwin\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Jake\n* [[Charles Chun|Charles Rahi Chun]] as General Jong\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as Daryl\n<!-- ones listed after here were minor characters such as Two-Fingered Man, Train Passengers, Korean Girl, Hot Korean Girls, Drone Pilot, etc. -->\n\nThe film also features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Eminem]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Seth Meyers]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Brian Williams]] and [[Scott Pelley]].
