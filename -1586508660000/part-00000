After the death of his wife, King Gongmin even went so far as to create a ministry whose sole purpose was to seek out and recruit young men from all over the country to serve in his court. Others including [[Chungseon of Goryeo|King Chungseon]] had long-term relationships with men. Those who were in same-sex relationships were referred to as ''yongyang jichong'', whose translation has been subject to argument, but is generally viewed as meaning the \"dragon and the sun\".<ref name=\"thesis\"/>\n\nIn the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon Era]], several noblemen and noblewomen are known to have had same-sex sexual relations, including Royal Noble Consort [[Sun-bin Bong]] who was the second consort of [[Munjong of Joseon]] and [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong]]'s daughter-in-law who was banished after it was discovered that she was sleeping with one of her maids. During this period, there were travelling theater groups known as ''[[namsadang]]'' which included underaged males called ''midong'' (\"beautiful boys\"). The troupes provided \"various types of entertainment, including band music, song, masked dance, circus, and puppet plays,\" sometimes with graphic representations of same-sex intercourse. The ''namsandang'' were further separated in two groups; the \"butch\" members (\uc22b\ub3d9\ubaa8, ''sutdongmo'') and the \"queens\" (\uc5ec\ub3d9\ubaa8, ''yeodongmo'', or \uc554\ub3d9\ubaa8, ''amdongmo'').<ref name=\"thesis\"/>\n\nThe spread of [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] in South Korea shaped the moral system, the way of life and social relations of Korean society. Neo-Confucianism emphasizes strict obedience to the social order and the family unit, which referred to a husband and wife. Homosexuality and same-sex relationships were viewed as disturbing this system and thus were perceived as \"deviant\" or \"immoral\". Since the 1910s, Neo-Confucianism has lost a lot of influence, though still today Confucian ideas and practices significantly define South Korean culture and society.<ref name=\"thesis\"/>\n\nHomosexuality was officially declassified as \"harmful and obscene\" in 2003.<ref name=\"Nqapia\"/>\n\n==Recognition of same-sex relationships==\n{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in South Korea}}\n\nSame-sex marriages and civil unions are not legally recognized in South Korea.

After the death of his wife, King Gongmin even went so far as to create a ministry whose sole purpose was to seek out and recruit young men from all over the country to serve in his court. Others including [[Chungseon of Goryeo|King Chungseon]] had long-term relationships with men. Those who were in same-sex relationships were referred to as ''yongyang jichong'', whose translation has been subject to argument, but is generally viewed as meaning the \"dragon and the sun\".<ref name=\"thesis\"/>\n\nIn the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon Era]], several noblemen and noblewomen are known to have had same-sex sexual relations, including Royal Noble Consort [[Sun-bin Bong]] who was the second consort of [[Munjong of Joseon]] and [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong]]'s daughter-in-law who was banished after it was discovered that she was sleeping with one of her maids. During this period, there were travelling theater groups known as ''[[namsadang]]'' which included underaged males called ''midong'' (\"beautiful boys\"). The troupes provided \"various types of entertainment, including band music, song, masked dance, circus, and puppet plays,\" sometimes with graphic representations of same-sex intercourse.

Homosexuality and same-sex relationships were viewed as disturbing this system and thus were perceived as \"deviant\" or \"immoral\".

A third film, ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' is in development and is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[San Dimas, California]], [[slacker]]s Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted (Theodore) Logan would rather pursue their band the Wyld Stallyns (Although they're rather inept at guitar and aren't even truly interested in learning to play better) than schoolwork. Bill and Ted are failing history, and they need an A+ on their history report if they want to pass the class. Ted's father, the local police captain, threatens to send Ted to military school in Alaska if they should flunk their history class (and school along with it), ruining their dreams of success. The two struggle to assemble a final report for the class, which is to describe how three historical figures would see modern-day San Dimas.\n\nSeven hundred years from then, in 2688, humanity has built a [[utopia]], thanks to the music of Wyld Stallyns. The supreme beings of this world instruct Rufus (Carlin) to travel back in time by a [[time travel|time machine]] disguised as a [[phone booth]], to help Bill and Ted pass their class. Rufus lands by the two as they work on their report near a [[Circle K]]. As he introduces himself, a second phone booth lands nearby, and future versions of Bill and Ted come out, proving their identity to their younger selves, and telling them to trust Rufus before they leave. Rufus offers to show the teens how the machine works, taking them to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1805, where [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is commanding the [[French Revolutionary Army|French Army]]. Assured the machine works, Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, though Napoleon, knocked back by an explosion, is caught in the phone booth's wake and dragged with them. Back at Ted's house, Rufus provides the teens additional instructions and then leaves before another identical phone booth time machine shows up. The two find Napoleon, passed out nearby, and come upon an idea of taking historical figures from the past to bring them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon, and set out. Before they go, Ted's father chews him out for failing history, losing his keys and not focusing on his schoolwork and grounds him until Ted ships out to military school the following night. Bill calls from the phone booth passing himself off as a new deputy, and instructing him to come the station to retrieve his lost keys, allowing Ted to escape, so they can work on their report. \n\nSeparately, they gain the trust of [[Billy the Kid]] from 1879, and [[Socrates]] from 410 BC, and bring them along. They next land in 15th century medieval England, and see two princesses, who flirt with them. Bill and Ted attempt help them escape, because their father has arranged marriage for both of them to \"two fat horrible old men\", but are caught by their father, the local king (whose entourage they refer to as 'royal ugly dudes'), and ordered to be beheaded. They are rescued at the last minute by Billy and Socrates, but in their escape, the phone booth's antenna is damaged by a knight's mace, and the booth starts running out of control. After a brief landing in the utopian society of 2688, Bill and Ted initially take advantage of it by obtaining more historical figures for extra credit, including [[Sigmund Freud]] from Vienna, Austria in 1901; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] from Kassel, Germany in 1810; [[Joan of Arc]] from Orleans, France in 1429; [[Genghis Khan]] from Outer Mongolia in 1209; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Washington, DC in 1863. With no more space in the booth, they finally see the broken antenna, and have to make a pit-stop in prehistoric times to make repairs. After a crude repair with chewing gum and pudding cups, Bill and Ted regain control of the booth, but they end up at the Circle K, witnessing their past selves on the night before the report. They repeat their advice to them about Rufus, and then ask Rufus how to get to their present time; Rufus also alerts them that time is running short.\n\nBack in their current timeframe, with two hours before the report presentation, Bill and Ted leave the historical figures at the local mall to experience San Dimas, while they try to track down Napoleon, whom Deacon had ditched the previous night after an embarrassing night out. They find Napoleon at the Waterloo water park, but by the time they return to the mall, the historical figures have caused a commotion, and are now in jail under Ted's father's watch, and he refuses to set them free. They develop a plan to use the time machine after the presentation as to plant elements via [[Causal loop|predestination paradoxes]] to help free the historical figures (finally explaining the disappearance of Ted's father's lost keys), and make their way to the school, barely arriving in time for their presentation. With the help of the historical figures, the two give an impressive presentation that ensures they pass the course.\n\nAfter returning the historical figures and successfully getting an A+ on their history report, Bill and Ted return to practice, and having matured somewhat along the journey, they decide maybe they should actually take time to learn to play better, when Rufus shows up with the two princesses in tow, having rescued them himself since he knows they will be their wives and bandmates in the future. As the band starts to play, terribly, Rufus [[Fourth wall|explains to the audience]], \"They do get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter, and George Carlin}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \u2018\u2019Theodore\u2019\u2019 Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

Alongside Reeves, 24 actors were called back and auditioned in various pairs to find a good chemistry. On that day, Reeves was one of the first to arrive along with [[Alex Winter]], and while waiting for the auditions to start, found out they had a lot of personal details in common, such as a common interest in [[bass guitar]] and [[motorcycle]]s.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> They quickly developed a rapport between each other during auditions, which earned them the title roles.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> A longstanding urban legend has it that Reeves auditioned for Bill and Winter for Ted. According to Winter, the story emerged because the characters are so similar, and even he and Reeves sometimes became confused about who was who.<ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/bill-ted-25th-anniversary-trivia/|title=Bill & Ted at 25: Dude, Bet You Didn\u2019t Know These 7 Gnarly Facts|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|date=17 February 2014|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=1 June 2016|location=San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nThrough rehearsals, Winter and Reeves worked on developing their Bill & Ted characters to move them away from being stereotypical comedic slackers and insert sincerity and other more human elements into them.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> While they developed mannerisms outside of the script, influenced partially by British comedians like [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Spike Milligan]], the pair kept to the dialog written by Solomon and Mathseon, with Winter calling it \"very floral, so paradoxical to how you think dumb Valley guys would speak\".<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Winter said that to develop Bill's character, he borrowed from the looks and trends along [[Venice Beach]], California, where he had been living, including wearing a baseball cap backwards and pulling part of his hair through that opening.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/>\n\nWinter said of casting [[George Carlin]] as Rufus as a \"very happy accident\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/|title=Hey, Alex Winter here from Bill & Ted and Downloaded and noticed a lot of child stars memes today.

Herek stated that their intention was to have [[Eddie Van Halen]] as Rufus, given the frequency of [[Van Halen]] references in the screenplay, but because of the low budget for the film, they could not get to happen. They started looking at other acting experience that would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian, and turned their thinking around to look at comedians. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at Waterloo are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]].

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult as to come up with the practical effects of filming the booth with multiple people standing inside it on a [[gimble]] in front of a [[green screen]] with numerous equipment and prop failures; Reeves called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you\u2019ve ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> Winter had found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive in February 2020 and shared them on the Internet and provided additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019 Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | accessdate = February 23, 2020 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the films credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \"Are there kids that really speak like this?\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Some of the former DEG executives ended up at [[Nelson Entertainment]], and along with [[Orion Pictures]], were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about {{USD|1 million}}.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Bill & Ted'' had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> It was followed in 1991 by a [[sequel]], ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam rock]], [[glam metal]], [[pop rock]], [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = A&M Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.

The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | authorlink= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate= 29 May 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1980s}}\n*[[Deus ex machina]]\n*[[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0096928}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098752}} (animated TV series)\n* {{IMDb title|0103365}} (TV series)\n* {{Amg title|5541}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Stephen Herek}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Socrates]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Genghis Khan on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven on film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films about Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1st century BC]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1420s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1805]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1879]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1901]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:San Dimas, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1989 film directed by Stephen Herek}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\n| image = Bill & Ted.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Theatrical release poster\n| director = [[Stephen Herek]]\n| producers = {{Plainlist|\n* Scott Kroopf\n* Michael S.

A third film, ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' is in development and is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[San Dimas, California]], [[slacker]]s Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted (Theodore) Logan would rather pursue their band the Wyld Stallyns (Although they're rather inept at guitar and aren't even truly interested in learning to play better) than schoolwork. Bill and Ted are failing history, and they need an A+ on their history report if they want to pass the class. Ted's father, the local police captain, threatens to send Ted to military school in Alaska if they should flunk their history class (and school along with it), ruining their dreams of success. The two struggle to assemble a final report for the class, which is to describe how three historical figures would see modern-day San Dimas.\n\nSeven hundred years from then, in 2688, humanity has built a [[utopia]], thanks to the music of Wyld Stallyns. The supreme beings of this world instruct Rufus (Carlin) to travel back in time by a [[time travel|time machine]] disguised as a [[phone booth]], to help Bill and Ted pass their class. Rufus lands by the two, as they work on their report near a [[Circle K]]. As he introduces himself, a second phone booth lands nearby, and future versions of Bill and Ted come out, proving their identity to their younger selves, and telling them to trust Rufus before they leave. Rufus offers to show the teens how the machine works, taking them to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1805, where [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is commanding the [[French Revolutionary Army|French Army]]. Assured the machine works, Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, though Napoleon, knocked back by an explosion, is caught in the phone booth's wake and dragged with them. Back at Ted's house, Rufus provides the teens additional instructions and then leaves before another identical phone booth time machine shows up. The two find Napoleon, passed out nearby, and come upon an idea of taking historical figures from the past to bring them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon, and set out. Before they go, Ted's father chews him out for failing history, losing his keys and not focusing on his schoolwork and grounds him until Ted ships out to military school the following night. Bill calls from the phone booth passing himself off as a new deputy, and instructing him to come the station to retrieve his lost keys, allowing Ted to escape, so they can work on their report. \n\nSeparately, they gain the trust of [[Billy the Kid]] from 1879, and [[Socrates]] from 410 BC, and bring them along. They next land in 15th century medieval England, and see two princesses, who flirt with them. Bill and Ted attempt help them escape, because their father has arranged marriage for both of them to \"two fat horrible old men\", but are caught by their father, the local king (whose entourage they refer to as 'royal ugly dudes'), and ordered to be beheaded. They are rescued at the last minute by Billy and Socrates, but in their escape, the phone booth's antenna is damaged by a knight's mace, and the booth starts running out of control. After a brief landing in the utopian society of 2688, Bill and Ted initially take advantage of it by obtaining more historical figures for extra credit, including [[Sigmund Freud]] from Vienna, Austria in 1901; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] from Kassel, Germany in 1810; [[Joan of Arc]] from Orleans, France in 1429; [[Genghis Khan]] from Outer Mongolia in 1209; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Washington, DC in 1863. With no more space in the booth, they finally see the broken antenna, and have to make a pit-stop in prehistoric times to make repairs. After a crude repair with chewing gum and pudding cups, Bill and Ted regain control of the booth, but they end up at the Circle K, witnessing their past selves on the night before the report. They repeat their advice to them about Rufus, and then ask Rufus how to get to their present time; Rufus also alerts them that time is running short.\n\nBack in their current timeframe, with two hours before the report presentation, Bill and Ted leave the historical figures at the local mall to experience San Dimas, while they try to track down Napoleon, whom Deacon had ditched the previous night after an embarrassing night out. They find Napoleon at the Waterloo water park, but by the time they return to the mall, the historical figures have caused a commotion, and are now in jail under Ted's father's watch, and he refuses to set them free. They develop a plan to use the time machine after the presentation as to plant elements via [[Causal loop|predestination paradoxes]] to help free the historical figures (finally explaining the disappearance of Ted's father's lost keys), and make their way to the school, barely arriving in time for their presentation. With the help of the historical figures, the two give an impressive presentation that ensures they pass the course.\n\nAfter returning the historical figures and successfully getting an A+ on their history report, Bill and Ted return to practice, and having matured somewhat along the journey, they decide maybe they should actually take time to learn to play better, when Rufus shows up with the two princesses in tow, having rescued them himself since he knows they will be their wives and bandmates in the future. As the band starts to play, terribly, Rufus [[Fourth wall|explains to the audience]], \"They do get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter, and George Carlin}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \u2018\u2019Theodore\u2019\u2019 Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

According to Winter, the story emerged because the characters are so similar, and even he and Reeves sometimes became confused about who was who.<ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/bill-ted-25th-anniversary-trivia/|title=Bill & Ted at 25: Dude, Bet You Didn\u2019t Know These 7 Gnarly Facts|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|date=17 February 2014|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=1 June 2016|location=San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nThrough rehearsals, Winter and Reeves worked on developing their Bill & Ted characters to move them away from being stereotypical comedic slackers and insert sincerity and other more human elements into them.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> While they developed mannerisms outside of the script, influenced partially by British comedians like [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Spike Milligan]], the pair kept to the dialog written by Solomon and Mathseon, with Winter calling it \"very floral, so paradoxical to how you think dumb Valley guys would speak\".<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Winter said that to develop Bill's character, he borrowed from the looks and trends along [[Venice Beach]], California, where he had been living, including wearing a baseball cap backwards and pulling part of his hair through that opening.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/>\n\nWinter said of casting [[George Carlin]] as Rufus as a \"very happy accident\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/|title=Hey, Alex Winter here from Bill & Ted and Downloaded and noticed a lot of child stars memes today.

Herek stated that their intention was to have [[Eddie Van Halen]] as Rufus, given the frequency of [[Van Halen]] references in the screenplay, but because of the low budget for the film, they could not get to happen. They started looking at other acting experience that would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian, and turned their thinking around to look at comedians. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at Waterloo are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]].

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult as to come up with the practical effects of filming the booth with multiple people standing inside it on a [[gimble]] in front of a [[green screen]] with numerous equipment and prop failures; Reeves called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you\u2019ve ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> Winter had found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive in February 2020 and shared them on the Internet and provided additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019 Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | accessdate = February 23, 2020 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the films credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \"Are there kids that really speak like this?\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Some of the former DEG executives ended up at [[Nelson Entertainment]], and along with [[Orion Pictures]], were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about {{USD|1 million}}.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Bill & Ted'' had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> It was followed in 1991 by a [[sequel]], ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam rock]], [[glam metal]], [[pop rock]], [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = A&M Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.

The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | authorlink= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate= 29 May 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1980s}}\n*[[Deus ex machina]]\n*[[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0096928}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098752}} (animated TV series)\n* {{IMDb title|0103365}} (TV series)\n* {{Amg title|5541}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Stephen Herek}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Socrates]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Genghis Khan on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven on film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films about Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1st century BC]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1420s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1805]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1879]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1901]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:San Dimas, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n", "name_user": "Davidnicholsknowsbest", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure"}

The Herald's visitations of the 15th century include the name of his son, Richard. These and later visitations show the descent in an unbroken line to [[Sir Edward Bullock]] of [[Faulkbourne]], Essex, who died in 1644.<ref name=bullock/>\n\nRichard\u2019s son, Gilbert, made formal declaration in 1250 of his holding of the manor of [[Sonning|Sunning]] from the [[William de York|Bishop of Salisbury]].\n\nRobert Bullock of Aborfield was Knight of the Shire for Berkshire (1382) and [[High Sheriff of Berkshire|Sheriff for the Counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire]] in 1384 and 1392 under [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. In 1394 he was Commissioner of the Peace for [[Berkshire]].

In 1544 he supplied archers, billmen and horses for the war with France, leading to the inclusion of seven bills originally in the family crest. Thomas's uncle, Hugh \"with ye Brazen Hand\", left Aberfield to found the family branch in Siddenhall (Sidnall), (Shropshire).<ref name=bullock/>\n\nThomas Bullock (1546-1595) was [[High Sheriff of Berkshire]] in 1581 and in the Commission of the Peace in 1592. He was the last Bullock of Arborfield, being obliged to sell the estates (the manors of Arberfield and Barkham, situated in the towns, villages and fields of Arberfeld, Barkham, Hurst, Ockingham, Shingfield and Erley) owing to accumulated debts. His uncle, George, refused to hand over the deeds. Thomas was forced by the family to produce a deed of entail and, having received the title deeds, went on to repudiate the deed. His brother and heir, William, litigated through the [[Court of Chancery]] and the [[Star Chamber]] but the sale was confirmed.<ref name=bullock/>\n\nThomas died in 1595, William, with the support of tenants, entered into possession in serious contempt of court, resulting in him being thrown into [[Fleet Prison]]. William continued actions to recover the estate in the [[Queen\u2019s Bench]], then the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and later petitioned the [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], but in vain.<ref name=bullock/><ref name=osmund/>\n\nWilliam, released from prison and now of [[Stratfield Mortimer]], married well, his third wife being Elizabeth Bellet of Morton in Essex, restoring the family fortunes.<ref name=bullock/>\n\nHis son, John, moved the family to the Manor House of Mulsham, at [[Great Wigborough]] in [[Essex]], where he purchased estates at Loftes in Great and Little Totham.

In 1544 he supplied archers, billmen and horses for the war with France, leading to the inclusion of seven bills originally in the family crest. Thomas's uncle, Hugh \"with ye Brazen Hand\", left Aberfield to found the family branch in Siddenhall (Sidnall), (Shropshire).<ref name=bullock/>\n\nThomas Bullock (1546-1595) was [[High Sheriff of Berkshire]] in 1581 and in the Commission of the Peace in 1592. He was the last Bullock of Arborfield, being obliged to sell the estates (the manors of Arberfield and Barkham, situated in the towns, villages and fields of Arberfeld, Barkham, Hurst, Ockingham, Shingfield and Erley) owing to accumulated debts. His uncle, George, refused to hand over the deeds. Thomas was forced by the family to produce a deed of entail and, having received the title deeds, went on to repudiate the deed. His brother and heir, William, litigated through the [[Court of Chancery]] and the [[Star Chamber]] but the sale was confirmed.<ref name=bullock/>\n\nThomas died in 1595, William, with the support of tenants, entered into possession in serious contempt of court, resulting in him being thrown into [[Fleet Prison]].

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions.
