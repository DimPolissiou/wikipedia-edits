After moving to New York City to pursue a degree in English literature from [[Columbia University]], he attended [[Mannes College of Music]]. In the late 1970s, Kline began his career as a full-time musician, and first joined the band [[Dark Day (band)|Dark Day]] with [[Robin Crutchfield]] (also of the band [[DNA (American band)|DNA]]). When he left [[Dark Day (band)|Dark Day]], he co-founded the [[No wave|no-wave]], [[art-punk]] band [[The Del-Byzanteens]] alongside filmmaker [[Jim Jarmusch]], author [[Luc Sante]], and painter [[James Nares]]. After these projects, he also toured internationally and recorded with the [[Glenn Branca|Glenn Branca Ensemble]] and began assisting with video projects by [[Nan Goldin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Dark-Day/25696/|title=Dark Day reviews, music, news \u2013 sputnikmusic|website=Sputnikmusic|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Virtual Music : How the Web Got Wired for Sound|first=William|last=Duckworth|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781136087301|oclc=826856037}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAs a continuation of his experimental work, Kline began creating [[Tape recorder|tape]]-based [[sound installation]]s for collections of [[boombox]]es inspired by the work of [[Brian Eno]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Glenn Branca]]. The first of these was called ''Bachman's Warbler'' (1990), which was written for [[harmonica]]s and twelve [[boombox]]es and premiered at [[Bang on a Can|Bang on a Can Marathon]] in New York City in 1992. The concept behind these pieces later contributed to his ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' (1992), which has since brought Kline worldwide recognition.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nFirst performed in New York City, ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' is an annual public performance piece in which anyone may participate. Every December, as part of this performance, a volunteer parade carrying boomboxes and other music players passes through [[Greenwich Village]], presenting an ambient cacophony made of recorded [[bell]]s, [[harp]]s, and [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] to the neighborhood. While ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' features musical references to ancient Christmas music, the piece itself and its performance are not religion-specific. Since its premiere in 1992, the ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' tradition has spread to over 116 cities around the world, mostly in the United States and Canada, but also to major cities across Europe, Oceania, Africa, and Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/philadelphia/article/Phil-Klines-Avant-Garde-Holiday-Tradition-UNSILENT-NIGHT-to-Parade-Through-37-Cities-This-December-20171120|title=Phil Kline's Avant-Garde Holiday Tradition UNSILENT NIGHT to Parade Through 37 Cities This December|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/arts/music-a-provocateur-takes-on-a-new-challenge.html|title=MUSIC; A Provocateur Takes On a New Challenge|last=Sisario|first=Ben|date=December 3, 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 February 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wqxr.org/story/86086-your-unsilent-night/|title=Your Unsilent Night {{!}} WQXR {{!}} New York's Classical Music Radio Station|publisher=WQXR|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagpole.com/music/music-features/2018/12/05/unsilent-night-fills-downtown-athens-with-seasonal-cheer|title=Unsilent Night Fills Downtown Athens With Seasonal Cheer|last=Goodson|first=Jessie|website=Flagpole Magazine {{!}} Athens, GA News, Music, Arts, Restaurants|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2017/12/06/from-block-long-stereo-system-stirring-sound-unsilent-night/J7GEw3EpM4EJnfvzN8haOI/story.html|title=From a \u2018block-long stereo system,\u2019 the stirring sound of \u2018Unsilent Night\u2019 \u2013 The Boston Globe|website=Boston Globe|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nKline's other notable work primarily includes [[song cycle]]s and opera. Kline's song cycles have historically had political themes, such as his ''Three Rumsfeld Songs'', which borrow text from the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] briefings of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] following the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] and during the [[War in Iraq]]. The source for Kline's ''Zippo Songs'' (2004), the song cycle for which he is best known, comes from US government-issued [[Zippo Lighter]]s from the [[Vietnam War]], on which some soldiers etched short sayings or poems.

After moving to New York City to pursue a degree in English literature from [[Columbia University]], he attended [[Mannes College of Music]]. In the late 1970s, Kline began his career as a full-time musician, and first joined the band [[Dark Day (band)|Dark Day]] with [[Robin Crutchfield]] (also of the band [[DNA (American band)|DNA]]). When he left [[Dark Day (band)|Dark Day]], he co-founded the [[No wave|no-wave]], [[art-punk]] band [[The Del-Byzanteens]] alongside filmmaker [[Jim Jarmusch]], author [[Luc Sante]], and painter [[James Nares]]. After these projects, he also toured internationally and recorded with the [[Glenn Branca|Glenn Branca Ensemble]] and began assisting with video projects by [[Nan Goldin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Dark-Day/25696/|title=Dark Day reviews, music, news \u2013 sputnikmusic|website=Sputnikmusic|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Virtual Music : How the Web Got Wired for Sound|first=William|last=Duckworth|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781136087301|oclc=826856037}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAs a continuation of his experimental work, Kline began creating [[Tape recorder|tape]]-based [[sound installation]]s for collections of [[boombox]]es inspired by the work of [[Brian Eno]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Glenn Branca]]. The first of these was called ''Bachman's Warbler'' (1990), which was written for [[harmonica]]s and twelve [[boombox]]es and premiered at [[Bang on a Can|Bang on a Can Marathon]] in New York City in 1992. The concept behind these pieces later contributed to his ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' (1992), which has since brought Kline worldwide recognition.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nFirst performed in New York City, ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' is an annual public performance piece in which anyone may participate. Every December, as part of this performance, a volunteer parade carrying boomboxes and other music players passes through [[Greenwich Village]], presenting an ambient cacophony made of recorded [[bell]]s, [[harp]]s, and [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] to the neighborhood. While ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' features musical references to ancient Christmas music, the piece itself and its performance are not religion-specific. Since its premiere in 1992, the ''[[Unsilent Night]]'' tradition has spread to over 116 cities around the world, mostly in the United States and Canada, but also to major cities across Europe, Oceania, Africa, and Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/philadelphia/article/Phil-Klines-Avant-Garde-Holiday-Tradition-UNSILENT-NIGHT-to-Parade-Through-37-Cities-This-December-20171120|title=Phil Kline's Avant-Garde Holiday Tradition UNSILENT NIGHT to Parade Through 37 Cities This December|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/arts/music-a-provocateur-takes-on-a-new-challenge.html|title=MUSIC; A Provocateur Takes On a New Challenge|last=Sisario|first=Ben|date=December 3, 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 February 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wqxr.org/story/86086-your-unsilent-night/|title=Your Unsilent Night {{!}} WQXR {{!}} New York's Classical Music Radio Station|publisher=WQXR|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flagpole.com/music/music-features/2018/12/05/unsilent-night-fills-downtown-athens-with-seasonal-cheer|title=Unsilent Night Fills Downtown Athens With Seasonal Cheer|last=Goodson|first=Jessie|website=Flagpole Magazine {{!}} Athens, GA News, Music, Arts, Restaurants|access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2017/12/06/from-block-long-stereo-system-stirring-sound-unsilent-night/J7GEw3EpM4EJnfvzN8haOI/story.html|title=From a \u2018block-long stereo system,\u2019 the stirring sound of \u2018Unsilent Night\u2019 \u2013 The Boston Globe|website=Boston Globe|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nKline's other notable work primarily includes [[song cycle]]s and opera.

The source for Kline's ''Zippo Songs'' (2004), the song cycle for which he is best known, comes from US government-issued [[Zippo Lighter]]s from the [[Vietnam War]], on which some soldiers etched short sayings or poems.

Your Press will give it to us.\"  However, he limited his divulging of CIA contacts to one individual, with a [[pseudonym]] of \"Collins\".

His sentence consisted of 10 years' confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a [[labor camp]].

His cellmate was Zigurds Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161, a Latvian political prisoner. Powers kept a diary and a journal while confined. Additionally he took up carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters from his family. The prison now contains a small museum with an exhibit on Powers, who allegedly developed a good rapport with Soviet prisoners there.

While descending under his parachute, Powers had time to scatter his escape map, and rid himself of part of his suicide device, a silver dollar coin suspended around his neck containing a poison-laced injection pin, though he kept the poison pin.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dobbs |first1=Michael |title=Gary Powers Kept a Secret Diary With Him After He Was Captured by the Soviets |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/gary-powers-secret-diary-soviet-capture-180956939/#yilEojcaVQvIj9qc.99 |website=Smithsonian |language=en}}</ref> \"Yet I was still hopeful of escape.\"  He hit the ground hard, was immediately captured, and taken to [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka Prison]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|61\u201363, 67\u201371, 76}} Powers did note a second chute after landing on the ground, \"some distance away and very high, a lone red and white parachute\".<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|69, 148\u201349, 274, 278}}<ref name=Rich>{{Cite book |last=Rich |first=Ben |title=Skunk Works |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1994 |ISBN=0316743305 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/skunkworks00benr/page/162 162\u201363] |url=https://archive.org/details/skunkworks00benr/page/162 }}</ref>{{rp|159\u201360}}\n\n===Attempted deception by the U.S. government===\nWhen the U.S. government learned of Powers's disappearance over the Soviet Union, they lied that a \"weather plane\" had strayed off course after its pilot had \"difficulties with his oxygen equipment\". What CIA officials did not realize was that the plane crashed almost fully intact, and the Soviets recovered its equipment. Powers was interrogated extensively by the [[KGB]] for months before he made a confession and a public apology for his part in [[espionage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=tdihVideoCategory&id=52645&HPF_rid=9121459&HPF_mid=1180_T1_Url3 |title=This Day in History \u2013 What Happened Today in History |publisher=History.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Pilot testimony compromised by newspaper reports===\nPowers tried to lie to limit the information he shared with the KGB to that which could be determined from the remains of his plane's wreckage. He was hampered by information appearing in the western press. A KGB major stated \"there's no reason for you to withhold information. We'll find it out anyway. Your Press will give it to us.\"  However, he limited his divulging of CIA contacts to one individual, with a [[pseudonym]] of \"Collins\".  At the same time, he repeatedly stated the maximum altitude for the U-2 was {{convert|68,000|ft|km}}, significantly lower than its actual flight ceiling.<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|xii, 78, 91, 128, 135, 137, 139, 145, 165\u201366, 256}}\n\n===Political consequence===\nThe incident set back talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. Powers's interrogations ended on June 30, and his solitary confinement ended on July 9. On August 17, 1960, his trial began for espionage before the military division of the Supreme Court of the USSR. Lieutenant General Borisoglebsky, Major General Vorobyev, and Major General Zakharov presided. Roman Rudenko acted as prosecutor in his capacity of [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]].  [[Mikhail I. Grinev]] served as Powers's defense counsel. In attendance were his parents and sister, and his wife Barbara and her mother. His father brought along his attorney Carl McAfee, while the CIA provided two additional attorneys.<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|110, 114, 119\u201320, 142\u201343, 148, 157\u201358, 162, 188, 220}}\n\n===Conviction===\nOn August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage, \"a grave crime covered by Article 2 of the Soviet Union's law 'On Criminality Responsibility for State Crimes'\".  His sentence consisted of 10 years' confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a [[labor camp]]. The US Embassy \"News Bulletin\" stated, according to Powers, \"as far as the government was concerned, I had acted in accordance with the instructions given me and would receive my full salary while imprisoned\".<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|157\u201361}}\n\nHe was held in [[Vladimir Central Prison]], about {{convert|150|mi|km}} east of Moscow, in building number 2 from September 9, 1960 until February 8, 1962. His cellmate was Zigurds Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161, a Latvian political prisoner. Powers kept a diary and a journal while confined. Additionally he took up carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters from his family. The prison now contains a small museum with an exhibit on Powers, who allegedly developed a good rapport with Soviet prisoners there. Some pieces of the plane and Powers's uniform are on display at the [[Central Air Force Museum|Monino Airbase museum]] near [[Moscow]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moninoaviation.com/33a.html|title=Air Force Museum \u2013 Monino, Russia|website=www.moninoaviation.com|access-date=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403143214/http://moninoaviation.com/33a.html|archive-date=April 3, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Prisoner exchange===\nOn February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged, along with U.S. student [[Frederic Pryor]], in a well-publicized spy swap at the [[Glienicke Bridge]] in [[Berlin]].

Empirical scales measure temperature in relation to convenient and stable parameters, such as the freezing and boiling point of water.  Absolute temperature is based on thermodynamic principles, using the lowest possible temperature as the zero point and selecting a convenient incremental unit.\n\n==Formal description==\nAccording to the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]], being in thermal equilibrium is an [[equivalence relation]]. Thus all thermal systems may be divided into a [[quotient set]] by this equivalence relation, denoted below as '''M'''. Assume the set '''M''' has the [[cardinality]] of '''c''', then one can construct an [[injective function]] \u0192:&nbsp;'''M'''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;'''R'''&nbsp;, by which every thermal system will have a number associated with it such that when and only when two thermal systems have the same such value, they will be in thermal equilibrium. This is clearly the property of temperature, and the specific way of assigning numerical values as temperature is called a ''scale of temperature''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The concepts of classical thermodynamics|publisher=Cambridge U.P.1966.|isbn=978-0-521-04359-5|author=H A Buchdahl|chapter=2.Zeroth law}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Statistical mechanics : an intermediate course|url=https://archive.org/details/statisticalmecha0000mora/page/6|url-access=registration|publisher=Singapore ; River Edge, N.J. : World Scientific, 2001|isbn=978-981-02-4477-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/statisticalmecha0000mora/page/6 6~7]|author=Giuseppe Morandi|author2=F Napoli|author3=E Ercolessi}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics|publisher=New York [u.a.] : Springer, 2004|pages=6~7|author=Walter Greiner|author2=Ludwig Neise |author3=Horst St\u00f6cker }}</ref> In practical terms, a temperature scale is always based on usually a single physical property of a simple thermodynamic system, called a thermometer, that defines a scaling function mapping the temperature to the measurable thermometric parameter. Such temperature scales that are purely based on measurement are called ''empirical temperature scales''.\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] provides a fundamental, natural definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] starting with a null point of [[absolute zero]]. A scale for thermodynamic temperature is established similarly to the empirical temperature scales, however, needing only one additional fixing point.\n\n==Empirical scales==\nEmpirical scales are based on the measurement of physical parameters that express the property of interest to be measured through some formal, most commonly a simple linear, functional relationship. For the measurement of temperature, the formal definition of thermal equilibrium in terms of the thermodynamic coordinate spaces of thermodynamic systems, expressed in the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]], provides the framework to measure temperature.\n\nAll temperature scales, including the modern thermodynamic temperature scale used in the [[International System of Units]], are calibrated according to thermal properties of a particular substance or device. Typically, this is established by fixing two well-defined temperature points and defining temperature increments via a linear function of the response of the thermometric device. For example, both the old [[Celsius scale]] and [[Fahrenheit scale]] were originally based on the linear expansion of a narrow mercury column within a limited range of temperature,<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg| isbn = 978-3-540-85417-3| last = Carl S. Helrich| title = Modern Thermodynamics with Statistical Mechanics| location = Berlin, Heidelberg| year = 2009}}</ref> each using different reference points and scale increments.\n\nDifferent empirical scales may not be compatible with each other, except for small regions of temperature overlap. If an alcohol [[thermometer]] and a mercury [[thermometer]] have same two fixed points, namely the freezing and boiling point of water, their reading will not agree with each other except at the fixed points, as the linear 1:1 relationship of expansion between any two thermometric substances may not be guaranteed.\n\nEmpirical temperature scales are not reflective of the fundamental, microscopic laws of matter. Temperature is a universal attribute of matter, yet empirical scales map a narrow range onto a scale that is known to have a useful functional form for a particular application. Thus, their range is limited. The working material only exists in a form under certain circumstances, beyond which it no longer can serve as a scale. For example, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] freezes below 234.32&nbsp;K, so temperature lower than that cannot be measured in a scale based on mercury. Even [[ITS-90]], which interpolates among different ranges of temperature, has only a range of 0.65&nbsp;K to approximately 1358&nbsp;K (\u2212272.5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 1085&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Ideal gas scale===\nWhen pressure approaches zero, all real gas will behave like ideal gas, that is, {{math|pV}} of a mole of gas relying only on temperature. Therefore, we can design a scale with {{math|pV}} as its argument. Of course any bijective function will do, but for convenience's sake linear function is the best. Therefore, we define it as<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/solliqth/solliqth.html|title=Thermometers and the Ideal Gas Temperature Scale}}</ref>\n\n: <math>T={1 \\over nR}\\lim_{p \\to 0}{pV}.</math>\n\nThe ideal gas scale is in some sense a \"mixed\" scale. It relies on the universal properties of gas, a big advance from just a particular substance. But still it is empirical since it puts gas at a special position and thus has limited applicability\u2014at some point no gas can exist. One distinguishing characteristic of ideal gas scale, however, is that it precisely equals thermodynamical scale when it is well defined (see [[#Equality to ideal gas scale|below]]).\n\n=== International temperature scale of 1990 ===\n{{main article|ITS-90}}\n\nITS-90 is designed to represent the thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing [[absolute zero]]) as closely as possible throughout its range.  Many different thermometer designs are required to cover the entire range. These include helium vapor pressure thermometers, helium gas thermometers, [[resistance thermometer|standard platinum resistance thermometers]] (known as SPRTs, PRTs or Platinum RTDs) and [[infrared thermometer|monochromatic radiation thermometers]].\n\nAlthough the Kelvin and Celsius scales are defined using absolute zero (0&nbsp;K) and the [[triple point]] of water (273.16&nbsp;K and 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C), it is impractical to use this definition at temperatures that are very different from the triple point of water. Accordingly, ITS\u201390 uses numerous defined points, all of which are based on various thermodynamic equilibrium states of fourteen pure [[chemical elements]] and one [[Chemical compound|compound]] (water).  Most of the defined points are based on a [[phase transition]]; specifically the [[Melting point|melting]]/[[freezing]] point of a pure chemical element.  However, the deepest [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] points are based exclusively on the [[vapor pressure]]/temperature relationship of helium and its isotopes whereas the remainder of its cold points (those less than room temperature) are based on [[triple point]]s.  Examples of other defining points are the triple point of hydrogen (\u2212259.3467&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the freezing point of aluminum (660.323&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nThermometers calibrated per ITS\u201390 use complex mathematical formulas to interpolate between its defined points.  ITS\u201390 specifies rigorous control over variables to ensure reproducibility from lab to lab.  For instance, the small effect that atmospheric pressure has upon the various melting points is compensated for (an effect that typically amounts to no more than half a [[millikelvin]] across the different altitudes and barometric pressures likely to be encountered). The standard even compensates for the pressure effect due to how deeply the temperature probe is immersed into the sample.  ITS\u201390 also draws a distinction between \"freezing\" and \"melting\" points.  The distinction depends on whether heat is going ''into'' (melting) or ''out of'' (freezing) the sample when the measurement is made.  Only gallium is measured while melting, all the other metals are measured while the samples are freezing.\n\nThere are often small differences between measurements calibrated per ITS\u201390 and thermodynamic temperature.  For instance, precise measurements show that the boiling point of [[VSMOW]] water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339&nbsp;K (99.9839&nbsp;\u00b0C) when adhering ''strictly'' to the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature.  When calibrated to ITS\u201390, where one must interpolate between the defining points of gallium and indium, the boiling point of VSMOW water is about 10 mK less, about 99.974&nbsp;\u00b0C.  The virtue of ITS\u201390 is that another lab in another part of the world will measure the very same temperature with ease due to the advantages of a comprehensive international calibration standard featuring many conveniently spaced, reproducible, defining points spanning a wide range of temperatures.\n\n== Celsius scale ==\n{{main article|Celsius}}\n\nCelsius (known until 1948 as centigrade) is a [[temperature]] scale that is named after the Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] (1701&ndash;1744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (\u00b0C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature ''[[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''(a difference between two temperatures or an [[uncertainty]]).\n\nFrom 1744 until 1954, 0&nbsp;\u00b0C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} \n\nAlthough these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement, between 1954 and 2019 the unit ''degree Celsius'' and the Celsius scale were defined by [[absolute zero]] and the [[Triple point#Triple%20point%20of%20water|triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|VSMOW]] (specially prepared water). This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the [[Kelvin]] scale, which defines the [[SI base unit]] of [[thermodynamic temperature]] with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being exactly 0 K and \u2212273.15 \u00b0C. Until 19 May 2019, the temperature of the triple point of water was defined as exactly 273.16 K (0.01 \u00b0C). This means that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin are exactly the same.\n\nOn 20 May 2019, the kelvin was [[2019 redefinition of SI base units#Kelvin|redefined]] so that its value is now determined by the definition of the [[Boltzmann constant]] rather than being defined by the triple point of VSMOW. This means that the triple point is now a measured value, not a defined value. The newly-defined exact value of the Boltzmann constant was selected so that the measured value of the VSMOW triple point is exactly the same as the older defined value to within the limits of accuracy of contemporary [[metrology]]. The degree Celsius remains exactly equal to the kelvin, and 0 K remains exactly \u2212273.15 \u00b0C.\n\n== Thermodynamic scale ==\n{{see also|Thermodynamic temperature|Kelvin}}\n\nThermodynamic scale differs from empirical scales in that it is absolute. It is based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics or statistical mechanics instead of some arbitrary chosen working material. Besides it covers full range of temperature and has simple relation with microscopic quantities like the average kinetic energy of particles (see [[equipartition theorem]]). In experiments ITS-90 is used to approximate thermodynamic scale due to simpler realization.\n\n=== Definition ===\n\n[[Lord Kelvin]] devised the thermodynamic scale based on the efficiency of heat engines as shown below:\n\nThe efficiency of an engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or\n\n: <math>\\eta = \\frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \\frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H} \\qquad (1)</math>,\n\nwhere w<sub>cy</sub> is the work done per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on q<sub>C</sub>/q<sub>H</sub>.\n\nBecause of [[Carnot theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot theorem]], any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> must have the same efficiency, meaning, the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only:\n\n: <math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C)\\qquad (2).</math>\n\nIn addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub> must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and another (intermediate) temperature ''T''<sub>2</sub>, and the second between ''T''<sub>2</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub>. This can only be the case if\n\n: <math>\n\nf(T_1,T_3) = \\frac{q_3}{q_1} = \\frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3).\n</math>\n\nSpecializing to the case that <math>T_1</math> is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water. Then for any ''T''<sub>2</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub>,\n\n: <math>f(T_2,T_3) = \\frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \\frac{273.16 \\cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \\cdot f(T_1,T_2)}.</math>\n\nTherefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by\n\n: <math>T = 273.16 \\cdot f(T_1,T) \\,</math>\n\nthen the function ''f'', viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is\n\n: <math>f(T_2,T_3) = \\frac{T_3}{T_2},</math>\n\nand the reference temperature ''T''<sub>1</sub> has the value 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used\u2014the choice here corresponds to the [[Kelvin]] scale.)\n\n=== Equality to ideal gas scale ===\n\nIt follows immediately that\n\n: <math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) = \\frac{T_C}{T_H}.\\qquad (3).</math>\n\nSubstituting Equation 3 back into Equation 1 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:\n\n: <math>\\eta = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}\\qquad (4).</math>\n\nThis is identical to the efficiency formula for [[Carnot cycle]], which effectively employs the ideal gas scale. This means that the two scales equal numerically at every point.\n\n==Conversion table between different temperatu450re scales==\n{{Timeline Temperature Conversion}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Temperature conversion]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n{{Scales of temperature}}\n{{Portal bar|Energy}}\n\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scale of Temperature}}\n[[Category:Temperature]]\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n'''Scale of temperature''' is a methodology of calibrating the [[physical quantity]] [[temperature]] in [[metrology]].

Then for any ''T''<sub>2</sub> and ''T''<sub>3</sub>,\n\n: <math>f(T_2,T_3) = \\frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \\frac{273.16 \\cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \\cdot f(T_1,T_2)}.</math>\n\nTherefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by\n\n: <math>T = 273.16 \\cdot f(T_1,T) \\,</math>\n\nthen the function ''f'', viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is\n\n: <math>f(T_2,T_3) = \\frac{T_3}{T_2},</math>\n\nand the reference temperature ''T''<sub>1</sub> has the value 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used\u2014the choice here corresponds to the [[Kelvin]] scale.)\n\n=== Equality to ideal gas scale ===\n\nIt follows immediately that\n\n: <math>\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) = \\frac{T_C}{T_H}.\\qquad (3).</math>\n\nSubstituting Equation 3 back into Equation 1 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:\n\n: <math>\\eta = 1 - \\frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}\\qquad (4).</math>\n\nThis is identical to the efficiency formula for [[Carnot cycle]], which effectively employs the ideal gas scale.

Kingdoms in the south east coast of the Indian Subcontinent had established trade, cultural and political relations with Southeast Asian kingdoms in [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]. This led to [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianisation]] and [[Sanskritisation]] of Southeast Asia within [[Indosphere]], Southeast Asian polities were the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Mandala (political model)|Mandala]] (polities, city states and confederacies).  \n\nUnlike the Hindu kingdoms within the Indian sub-continent, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava empire]] of the southeastern coast of the India peninsula did not have culture restrictions on crossing the sea. [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] also had profound impact on Southeast Asia, who executed [[South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I]] and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]]. This led to more exchanges through the sea routes into Southeast Asia. Whereas Buddhism thrived and became the main religion in many countries of the Southeast Asia, it died off on the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe peoples of [[maritime Southeast Asia]] \u2014 present day Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are thought to have migrated southwards from southern China sometime between 2500 and 1500 BC. The influence of the civilization of the subcontinent gradually became predominant among them, and among the peoples of the Southeast Asian mainland. \n\nSouthern Indian traders, adventurers, teachers and priests continued to be the dominating influence in Southeast Asia until about 1500 CE. Hinduism and Buddhism both spread to these states from India and for many centuries existed there with mutual toleration. Eventually the states of the mainland became mainly Buddhist.\n\n<!--\nTO BE CLEANED UP LATER with edit comment Updating from [[Silk road]], [[Indian maritime history]], [[Maritime Silk Route]]. \n\n==Drivers of Indianisation of Southeast Asia==\nKey driver of [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianisation]] of Southeast Asia were [[Indian maritime history|Indian maritime trade]] especially [[Spice trade]], emissaries of Ashoka, [[Ashoka#Buddhist_missions|Buddhist missions]] of [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka - the Great]], \n\n==Indian maritime with Southeast Asia==\n{{see also | Indian maritime history | Spice trade }}\n[[File:Indian ship on lead coin of Vashishtiputra Shri Pulumavi.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Indian ship on lead coin of [[Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi]], testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st\u20132nd century CE.]]\n\nThe first clear mention of a navy occurs in the mythological epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref name=Chakravarti>Chakravarti (1930)</ref> Historically, however, the first attested attempt to organise a navy in India, as described by [[Megasthenes]] (c. 350\u2014290 BCE), is attributed to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign 322\u2014298 BCE).<ref name=Chakravarti/> The [[Mauryan empire]] (322\u2013185 BCE) navy continued till the times of emperor [[Ashoka]] (reign 273\u201432 BCE), who used it to send massive diplomatic missions to Greece, [[Syria]], Egypt, [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]].<ref name=Chakravarti/> Following nomadic interference in [[Siberia]]\u2014one of the sources for India's bullion\u2014India diverted its attention to the [[Malay peninsula]], which became its new source for gold and was soon exposed to the world via a series of maritime [[trade route]]s.<ref name=shaffer309/> The period under the Mauryan empire also witnessed various other regions of the world engage increasingly in the Indian Ocean maritime voyages.<ref name=shaffer309 />\n\n=== Buddhist missions ===\nIn the Sri Lankan tradition, [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] \u2013 who is patronised by Ashoka \u2013 sends out nine Buddhist missions to spread Buddhism in the \"border areas\" in c. 250 BCE. This tradition does not credit Ashoka directly with sending these missions. Each mission comprises five monks, and is headed by an elder.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} To Sri Lanka, he sent his own son Mahinda, accompanied by four other Theras \u2013 Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n\nThe Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\n* Mahinda to Sri Lanka\n* Majjhantika to Kashmir and Gandhara\n* Mahadeva to Mahisa-mandala (possibly modern Mysore region)\n* Rakkhita to Vanavasa\n* Dhammarakkhita the Greek to Aparantaka (western India)\n* Maha-dhamma-rakkhita to Maharashtra\n* Maharakkhita to the Greek country\n* Majjhima to the Himalayas\n* So\u1e47a and Uttara to Suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi (possibly Lower Burma and Thailand)\n\nThe tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\n\nScholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}} According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the ''Vinaya Nidana'' mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at [[Bhilsa]] (near [[Vidisha]]). These caskets have been dated to early 2nd century BCE, and the inscription states that the monks are of the Himalayan school.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} The missions may have set out from Vidisha in central India, as the caskets were discovered there, and as Mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nAccording to Gombrich, the mission may have included representatives of other religions, and thus, Lamotte's objection about \"dhamma\" is not valid. The Buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non-Buddhists, so as not to sideline Buddhism.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}} Frauwallner and Gombrich also believe that Ashoka was directly responsible for the missions, since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities. The Sri Lankan chronicles, which belong to the Theravada school, exaggerate the role of the Theravadin monk Moggaliputta-Tissa in order to glorify their sect.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}}\n\nSome historians argue that Buddhism became a major religion because of Ashoka's royal patronage.{{sfn|Thapar|1995|p=32}} \n\n\n===Early Common Era\u2014High Middle Ages===\n{{main | Greater India | Indosphere | Chola invasion of Srivijaya | Maritime history of Odisha }}\n{{See also | Sanskritisation |Chola dynasty|Chera dynasty|Pandya dynasty|Pallava dynasty}}\n[[Image:Rajendra map new.svg|thumb|right|300px|Chola territories during [[Rajendra Chola I]], c. 1030 CE.]]\n[[Image:Ship compartments.jpg|thumb|200px|Model of a [[Chola]] (200\u2014848 CE) ship's hull, built by the [[Archaeological Survey of India|ASI]], based on a wreck 19 miles off the coast of Poombuhar, displayed in a Museum in [[Tirunelveli]].]]\n\nDuring this era, [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia |Buddhist]] religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with [[Greater India|economic activity and commerce]] as patrons entrusted large funds which would later be used to benefit local economy by estate management, craftsmanship and promotion of trading activities.<ref name=Donkin67>Donkin, 67</ref> [[Buddhism]], in particular, travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art and literacy.<ref name=Donkin69>Donkin, 69</ref>\n\nIn [[Java]] and [[Borneo]], the introduction of Indian culture created a demand for aromatics, and trading posts here later served Chinese and Arab markets.<ref name=Donkin1>Donkin, 59</ref> The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' names several Indian ports from where large ships sailed in an easterly direction to ''[[Chryse (placename)|Chryse]]''.<ref>Donkin, 64</ref> Products from the [[Maluku Islands]] that were shipped across the ports of Arabia to the [[Near East]] passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka.<ref name=Donkin4>Donkin, 92</ref> After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, products were sometimes shipped to [[East Africa]], where they were used for a variety of purposes including burial rites.<ref name=Donkin4/>\n\n[[Maritime history of Odisha]], known as [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] in ancient times, started before 350&nbsp;BC according to early sources.

The Dharmaguptakas and the Sarvastivadins were two of the major Nikaya schools. These were both eventually displaced by the Mahayana, also known as \"Great Vehicle\". This movement of Buddhism first gained influence in the [[Khotan]] region.<ref name=\"Foltz 1999 38\"/> The Mahayana, which was more of a \"pan-Buddhist movement\" than a school of Buddhism, appears to have begun in northwestern India or Central Asia. It formed during the 1st century BCE and was small at first, and the origins of this \"Greater Vehicle\" are not fully clear. Some Mahayana scripts were found in northern Pakistan, but the main texts are still believed to have been composed in Central Asia along the Silk Road. These different schools and movements of Buddhism were a result of the diverse and complex influences and beliefs on the Silk Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=41}}</ref> With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, the initial direction of Buddhist development changed. This form of Buddhism highlighted, as stated by Xinru Liu, \"the elusiveness of physical reality, including material wealth.\" It also stressed getting rid of material desire to a certain point; this was often difficult for followers to understand.<ref>Xinru Liu, \"The Silk Road in World History\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 21.</ref>\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries CE, [[merchants]] played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, merchants supported Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road, and in return the Buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled.<ref>[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 43\u201344.</ref> Merchants also helped to establish [[diaspora]] within the communities they encountered, and over time their cultures became based on Buddhism.

Historians believe that there was a forerunner Indianised Hindu-Buddhist state to the present day Brunei Sultanate. One predecessor state was called Vijayapura, which possibly existed in northwest [[Borneo]] in the 7th century.{{efn|1=Not to be confused with the [[Vijayapura|Indian state of the same name]].}} It was probably a subject state of the powerful Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire based in [[Sumatra]].

In Lower Burma they supplanted an earlier people: the Pyu, of whom little is known except that they practised Hinduism. \n\n===Arrival of Buddhism and impact of Indian literature (3rd century CE onward)===\nThe Mons strongly influenced by their contacts with Indian traders during the 3rd century B.C adopted Indian literature and art and the Buddhist religion. The Mins were the earliest known civilization in Southeast Asia. They consisted of several Mon kingdoms, spreading from Lower Burma into much of Thailand, where they founded the kingdom of Dvaravati. Their principal settlements in Burma were Thaton and Pegu. \n\n===Tibeto-Burman Buddhist kingdoms (11th - 13th century CE )===\nFrom about the 9th century onward Tibeto-Burman tribes moved south from the hills east of Tibet into the Irrawaddy plain. They founded their capital at Pagan in Upper Burma in the 10th century. They eventually absorbed the Mons, their cities and adopted the Mon civilization and Buddhism. The Pagan kingdom united all Burma under one rule for 200 years - from the 11th to 13th centuries. The zenith of its power occurred during the reign of King Anawratha (1044\u20131077), who conquered the Mon kingdom\nof Thaton. King Anawratha built many of the temples for which Pagan is famous. It is estimated that some 13,000 temples once existed within the city, which some 5,000 still stand.\n\n===13th-21st century===\n{{empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Cambodia==\n===Funan===\n[[File:Siem Reap Reflections (CAMBODIA-REFLECTION-ANGKOR WAT) VI (1070423631).jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Angkor Wat]]]]\nThe first of these Hinduised states to achieve widespread importance was the [[Kingdom of Funan]] founded in the 1st century CE in what is now [[Cambodia]] \u2014 according to legend, after the marriage of a Brahman into the family of the local chief. These local inhabitants were [[Khmer people]]. Funan flourished for some 500 years. It carried on a prosperous trade with India and China, and its engineers developed an extensive canal system. An elite practised statecraft, art and science, based on Indian culture. Vassal kingdoms spread to southern Vietnam in the east and to the [[Malay Peninsula]] in the west.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Chenla and Angkor===\nIn late 6th century CE, dynastic struggles caused the collapse of the Funan empire. It was succeeded by another Hindu-Khmer state, Chen-la, which lasted until the 9th century. Then a [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] king, Jayavarman II (about 800-850) established a capital at [[Angkor]] in central Cambodia. He founded a cult which identified the king with the Hindu God Shiva \u2013 one of the triad of Hindu gods, Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, Shiva the god symbolising destruction and reproduction.  The Angkor empire flourished from the 9th to the early 13th century. It reached the peak of its fame under Jayavarman VII at the end of the 12th century, when its conquests extended into Thailand in the west (where it had conquered the Mon kingdom of Dwaravati) and into Champa in the east. Its most celebrated memorial is the great temple of [[Angkor Wat]], built early in the 12th century.  This summarises the position on the South East Asian mainland until about the 12th century. Meanwhile, from about the 6th century, and until the 14th century, there was a series of great maritime empires based on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. In early days these Indians came mostly from the ancient kingdom of Kalinga, on the south-eastern coast of India. Indians in Indonesia are still known as \"Klings\", derived from Kalinga.\n\n==East Timor==\nThe later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.<ref name=\"Taylor 2003 page 378\">{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |url=https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean/page/378 378]|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}</ref>\n\n===Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (3rd century ~ 16th century) ===\n{{main| History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia | Greater India | Indosphere | Indianisation }}\n\n====Earlier Buddhist era (3rd century BCE - 7th century) ====\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Indianised Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire (7th - 12th century) ====\n{{main| Srivijaya empire }}\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\nOral traditions of people of [[Wehali]] principality of East Timor mention their  migration from Sina Mutin Malaka or ''\"Chinese White [[Malacca]]\"'' (part of [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianised]] Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya empire]]) in ancient times.<ref>H.J.

In the islands of Southeast Asia the first organised state to achieve fame was the Hindu Malay kingdom of [[Srivijaya]], with its capital at Palembang in southern [[Sumatra]]. Its commercial pre-eminence was based on command of the sea route from India to China between Sumatra and the Malay peninsula (later known as the Straits of [[Malacca]]). In the 6th \u2013 7th centuries [[Srivijaya]] succeeded Funan as the leading state in Southeast Asia. Its ruler was the overlord of the Malay peninsula and western [[Java]] as well as [[Sumatra]]. Like most of the early kingdoms of Soutehast Asia, Srivijaya was Dravidian in culture and administration, and Buddhism became firmly entrenched there. \n\n===Sailendra kingdom===\nThe expansion of Srivijaya was resisted in eastern Java, where the powerful Buddhist [[Sailendra]] dynasty arose. (From the 7th century onwards there was great activity in temple building in eastern Java. The most impressive of the ruins is at Borobudur, considered to have been the largest Buddhist temple in the world.) Sailendra rule spread to southern Sumatra, and up to Malay peninsula to [[Cambodia]] (where it was replaced by the [[Angkor]] kingdom). In the 9th century, the Sailendras moved to Sumatra, and a union of Srivijaya and the Sailendras formed an empire which dominated much of Southeast Asia for the next five centuries. With the departure of the Sailendras a new Majapahit kingdom appeared in eastern Java, which reverted from Buddhism to Hinduism. After 500 Years of supremacy Srivijaya was superseded by Majapahit. The various Indianised states and empires of this first 1500 years CE, though founded by Indian colonisation and maintaining diplomatic contacts with India, remained politically independent of the Indian kingdoms. The only exception to this was the temporary conquest of Malaya by the [[Chola]] kingdom of southern India in the 11th century.\n\n===Mataram kingdom===\nIn the 10th century, Mataram, challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; and the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java.\n\n===Kediri kingdom===\nKediri kingdom, spread its influence to the eastern part of Southeast Asia and became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming of increasing importance, as the demand by European countries for spices grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and Kediri became a strong trading nation. \n\n===Singhasari kingdom===\nIn the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. \n\n===Majapahit empire===\nBy the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.\n\n==Laos==\n{{See also | History of Laos#Indianisation | l1= Indianised early kingdoms of Laos }}\n\n===Funan kingdom ===\n\nThe first indigenous kingdom to emerge in [[Indochina]] was referred to in Chinese histories as the [[Kingdom of Funan]] and encompassed an area of modern [[Cambodia]], and the coasts of southern [[Vietnam]] and southern [[Thailand]] since the 1st century CE.

A 7th-century Indian drama, ''Kaumudhimahotsva'', refers to Kedah as Kataha-nagari. The ''Agnipurana'' also mentions a territory known as Anda-Kataha with one of its boundaries delineated by a peak, which scholars believe is [[Gunung Jerai]]. Stories from the ''Katasaritasagaram'' describe the elegance of life in Kataha. The Buddhist [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom|kingdom of Ligor]] took control of Kedah shortly after. Its king [[Chandrabhanu]] used it as a base to attack [[Sri Lanka]] in the 11th century and ruled the northern parts, an event noted in a stone inscription in Nagapattinum in [[Tamil Nadu]] and in the Sri Lankan chronicles, ''[[Mahavamsa]]''.\n\n=====Decline of Srivijaya empire and inner fights of breakup vassal states (12th - 13th century)=====\nAt times, the Khmer kingdom, the Siamese kingdom, and even Cholas kingdom tried to exert control over the smaller Malay states.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The power of Srivijaya declined from the 12th century as the relationship between the capital and its vassals broke down. Wars with the Javanese caused it to request assistance from China, and wars with Indian states are also suspected. In the 11th century, the centre of power shifted to [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]], a port possibly located further up the Sumatran coast near the [[Batang Hari River|Jambi River]].<ref name=\"History\"/> The power of the Buddhist Maharajas was further undermined by the [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]]. Areas which were converted to Islam early, such as [[Aceh]], broke away from Srivijaya's control. By the late 13th century, the Siamese kings of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] had brought most of Malaya under their rule. In the 14th century, the Hindu Java-based [[Majapahit]] empire came into possession of the peninsula.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n===Defeat and conversion to Islamic sultanates in 14th and 15th century===\nIn the 14th century that first [[Islam]]ic sultanate was established. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C.

However, the lion motif is common in Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of the words for \"throne\" in the [[Malay language]] is \"singgasana\", meaning \"lion's seat\" in Sanskrit), and it has been speculated that the \"Singapura\" name, and the tale of the lion, were invented by court historians of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] to glorify Sang Nila Utama and his line of descent.<ref name=\"baker\">{{cite book | last = Baker | first = Jim | title = Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia | date = 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDifferent versions of its history are told in Portuguese sources, suggesting that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by  [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] from Palembang.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N.

Evidence of strong religious, cultural and linguistic links abound.\n\n===Propagation of Buddhism in Thailand by emperor Ashoka (3rd centure BCE)===\nHistorically, the cultural and economic interaction between the two countries can be traced to roughly around the 6th century B.C. The single most significant cultural contribution of India, for which Thailand is greatly indebted to India, is [[Buddhism]]. Propagated in Thailand in the 3rd century B.C. by Buddhist monks sent by [[King Asoka]], it was adopted as the state religion of Thailand and has ruled the hearts and minds of Thais ever since. Presently 58,000,000 Thais, an overwhelming 94% of the total Thai populace adheres to Buddhism. However, direct contact can be said to have begun only in the 3rd century B.C. when King Asoka sent Buddhist monks to propagate Buddhism in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Besides Buddhism, Thailand has also adopted other typically Indian religious and cultural traditions. The ceremonies and rites especially as regards the Monarchy evidence a strong Hindu influence.\n\n===Sukhothai period: Settlement of Indian traders and Brahmins in Thailand (1275\u20131350) ===\nThe Indians who moved into Thailand in the [[Sukhothai period]] (1275\u20131350) were either merchants who came to Siam or Thailand, for the purpose of trading or [[Brahmans]] who played an important role in the Siamese court as experts in astrology and in conducting ceremonies. The first group of Brahmans who entered Siam before the founding of Sukhothai as the first capital of Siam (1275\u20131350) popularized Hindu beliefs and traditions. During the Sukhothai period Brahman temples already existed. Brahmans conducted ceremonies in the court. The concepts of divine kingship and royal ceremonies are clear examples of the influence of Brahmanism.\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] are practiced more or less in its original form even up to the present reign. The Thai idea that the king is a reincarnation of the Hindu deity [[Vishnu]] was adopted from Indian tradition. (Though this belief no longer exists today, the tradition to call each Thai king of the present Chakri dynasty Rama (Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu) with an ordinal number, such as Rama I, Rama II etc. is still in practice.)\n\n===SukhAyutthaya period: Settlement of more Indian Tamil traders in Thailand (1350\u20131767 CE) ===\nIn the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] era (1350\u20131767), more Tamil merchants entered the South of the country by boat as evidenced by the statues of Hindu gods excavated in the South.\n\n===Later migration of Indians to Thailand (1855 CE - present day) ===\nAfter the year 1855, the Tamils who migrated to Thailand can be classified into three groups according to the religion they believed in, namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. \n\n===Indian cultural influence on Thailand===\n====Dance====\n[[Thai literature]] and [[Thai art|drama]] draws great inspiration from [[Indian art]]s and [[Hindu mythology|legend]]. The Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] is as popular in Thailand as it is in India. Thailand has adapted the Ramayana to suit the Thai lifestyle in the past and has come up with its own version of the Ramayana, namely, the [[Ramakien]].\n\nTwo of the most popular classical dances the [[Khon]], performed by men wearing ferocious masks, and the [[Dance_in_Thailand#Lakhon|Lakhon]] ([[Lakhon nai]], [[Lakhon chatri]] and [[Lakhon nok]]), performed by women who play both male and female roles draws inspiration primarily from the Ramakien. Percussion instruments and [[Piphat]], a type of woodwind accompany the dance.<ref name=\"indthai\">http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Historical-Ties-India-and-Thailand-1.aspx</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are [[shadow play]] called [[nang talung]] in Thai. This is a show in which shadows of pieces of cow or water buffalo hide cut to represent human figures with movable arms and legs are thrown on a screen for the entertainment of spectators. In [[South India]], this kind of show is called Bommalattam.\n\n====Language====\n\n[[Thai language]] too bears close affinity with Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. An indication of the close linguistic affiliation between India and Thailand can be found in common Thai words like Ratha Mantri, Vidhya, Samuthra, Karuna, Prannee etc. which are almost identical to their Indian counterparts. Thai language basically consists of monosyllabic words that are individually complete in meaning. His Majesty King [[Ram Khamhaeng]] the Great created the [[Thai script|Thai alphabet]] in 1283. He modeled it on the ancient Indian alphabets of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] through the medium of the [[Khmer script|old Khmer characters]]. Like most world languages, the Thai language is a complicated mixture derived from several sources. Many Thai words used today were derived from [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], Khmer, Malay, English and Chinese.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Religious ceremonies and festivals====\nSeveral Thai ceremonies have been adopted from Indian tradition. These include ceremonies related to ordination, marriage, merit making and cremation. Though the Lord Buddha is the prime inspiration of Thailand, Brahma and other Hindu deities are widely worshipped among the Thais, due in part to the popularity of the Hindu ceremonial rites, which are used especially for royal ceremonies.\n\n(1) The '''[[Triyampawai ceremony|Triyampawai Ceremony]] or the Giant Swing Ceremony'''. Originally a [[Brahmin]] ceremony performed to pay homage to the God [[Shiva]], it was traditionally held front of [[Wat Suthat]], while the King and Queen watched the ceremony from a gold silk pavilion. Though the ceremony was abolished during the reign of King [[Rama VII]] due to a severe economic fall, Brahman priests are still allocated money to make offerings to God Shiva.\n\n(2) The '''[[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]]''', which is officiated by H.M. the king at [[Sanam Luang]] in May every year with pomp. Originally a Brahmanic rite, it was adopted to mark the beginning of the farming season as also to bless all farmers with fertility for the year.\n\n(3) The '''Royal Ceremony for preparing Celestial Rice''' or [[Glutinous_rice#Thai|Khao thip]] which was said to be originally prepared by celestial beings in honor of God Indra. A portion of the celestial rice is offered to monks while the remainder was divided in varying quantities among the royal family, courtiers and household members. The making of the ambrosial dish has come to a natural end since custom demanded that virgins alone should perform the preparation and stirring of celestial rice.\n\n(4) The '''[[Kathina]] Ceremony''' or the period during which Buddhist monks receive new robes, which generally falls in the months of October- November.\n\n(5) '''[[Loy Krathong]]''' \u2013 the Festival of Lights which is celebrated on the full moon night of the twelfth lunar month. The [[Loi Krathong|floating of Loi Krathong lanterns]], which began in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] period, continued throughout the different stages of Thai history. The present day understanding is that the festival is celebrated as an act of worship to [[Phra Mae Thorani|Chao Mae Kangka]], the Goddess of the Waters, for providing the water much needed throughout the year, and as a way of asking forgiveness if they have polluted it or used it carelessly.\n\n(6) '''[[Songkran]] Festival''': Songkran day marks Thai New Year day. \"Songkran\" signifies the sun's move into the first house of the zodiac. It is similar to Indian [[Holi]].\n\n(7) '''[[Vesak|Visakha]] Puja Day''' which is considered as the greatest Buddhist holy day as it commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of the Lord Buddha.\n\nOther famous ceremonial holy days include [[M\u0101gha P\u016bj\u0101|Magha Puja]] day, in February and [[Asalha Puja]] day in July which commemorates the day on which Lord Buddha delivered the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|First Sermon]] to his five disciples, namely, Konthanya, Vassapa, Bhattiya, [[Mahanama]] and Assashi at [[Sarnath|Esipatanamaruekathayawan]] (Isipatana forest at Sarnath in India) and there explained his concept of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (Ariyasai).<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Hindu astrology====\n[[Hindu astrology]] still has a great impact on several important stages of Thai life. Thai people still seek advice from knowledgeable Buddhist monks or Brahman astrologers about the auspicious or inauspicious days for conducting or abstaining from ceremonies for moving house or getting married.\n\n====Influence of Ayurveda on Thai traditional medicine and massage ====\nAccording to the Thai monk Venerable [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's writing, \u2018India's Benevolence to Thailand\u2019, the Thais also obtained the methods of making [[Ayurveda|herbal medicines]] (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like Sarabhi of [[Clusiaceae|Guttiferae family]], Kanika or [[Parijata|harsinghar]], phikun or [[Mimusops elengi]] and bunnak or the [[Mesua ferrea|rose chestnut]] etc. were brought from India.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Influence of Indian cuisine and spices on Thai cuisine ====\nThai monk [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's pointed out that [[Thai cuisine]] too was influenced by [[Indian cuisine]]. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use [[Ayurveda|spices]] in their food in various ways from Indians.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n==Vietnam==\n===Early Chinese vassal states===\nAt the eastern extremity of mainland Southeast Asia, northern [[Vietnam]] was originally occupied by Austro-Asiatic peoples. However, when regional power structures shifted [[Baiyue|tribes from Southern China]] began to settle in these lands. About 207 BC, a Chinese general, taking advantage of the temporary fragmentation of the Chinese Empire on the collapse of the Ch\u2019in dynasty, created in northern Vietnam the kingdom of Annam. During the 1st century BC, Annam was incorporated in the Chinese Empire of the Han dynasty; and it remained a province of the empire until the fall of the T'ang dynasty early in the 10th century. It then regained its independence, often as a nominal Vassal of the Chinese Emperor.  \n\n===Establishment of Indianised Hindu kingdom of Champa by Indonesian rulers (10th century -) ===\nIn south-central Vietnam the Chams, a people of Indonesian stock, established the Hinduised kingdom of [[Champa]] c. 400. Subject to periodic invasions by the Annamese and by the Khmers of Cambodia, Champa survived and prospered. In 1471, a Vietnamese army of approximately 300,000, invaded Champa under Emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] (\u9ece\u8056\u5b97). The invasion began as a consequence of Cham King's [[B\u00e0n La Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n|Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n]] attack on Vietnam in 1470. The Vietnamese committed genocide against the Cham slaughtering approximately 60,000. The Vietnamese destroyed, burnt and raided massive parts of Champa, seizing the entire kingdom. Thousands of Cham escaped to Cambodia, the remaining were forced to assimilate into [[Vietnamese culture]]. Today, only 80,000 Cham remain in Vietnam.\n\n===Influence of Indian-origin Buddhism on Vietnam via Chinese culture===\nVietnam, or then known as [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annam]] ([[wikt:\u5b89|\u5b89]] [[wikt:\u5357|\u5357]]; pinyin: \u0100nn\u00e1n), experienced little Hindu influence \u2013 usually via Champa. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries (except for Singapore and the Philippines), Vietnam was influenced by the Indian-origin religion Buddhism via the strong impact of [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of China]].\n\n==See also==\n* Spread of Indian influence\n** [[Greater India]]\n** [[Indosphere]]\n** [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Indianization of Southeast Asia]]\n\n* Trading routes\n** [[Maritime history of India]]\n** [[Silk route]]\n** [[Ancient maritime history]]\n\n* Other related\n** [[List of Southeast Asian leaders]]\n** [[Southeast Asian Games]]\n** [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]]\n** [[Tiger Cub Economies]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George C\u0153d\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

Kingdoms in the south east coast of the Indian Subcontinent had established trade, cultural and political relations with Southeast Asian kingdoms in [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]. This led to [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianisation]] and [[Sanskritisation]] of Southeast Asia within [[Indosphere]], Southeast Asian polities were the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Mandala (political model)|Mandala]] (polities, city states and confederacies).  \n\nUnlike the Hindu kingdoms within the Indian sub-continent, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava empire]] of the southeastern coast of the India peninsula did not have culture restrictions on crossing the sea. [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] also had profound impact on Southeast Asia, who executed [[South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I]] and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]]. This led to more exchanges through the sea routes into Southeast Asia. Whereas Buddhism thrived and became the main religion in many countries of the Southeast Asia, it died off on the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe peoples of [[maritime Southeast Asia]] \u2014 present day Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are thought to have migrated southwards from southern China sometime between 2500 and 1500 BC. The influence of the civilization of the subcontinent gradually became predominant among them, and among the peoples of the Southeast Asian mainland. \n\nSouthern Indian traders, adventurers, teachers and priests continued to be the dominating influence in Southeast Asia until about 1500 CE. Hinduism and Buddhism both spread to these states from India and for many centuries existed there with mutual toleration. Eventually the states of the mainland became mainly Buddhist.\n\n<!--\nTO BE CLEANED UP LATER with edit comment Updating from [[Silk road]], [[Indian maritime history]], [[Maritime Silk Route]]. \n\n==Drivers of Indianisation of Southeast Asia==\nKey driver of [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianisation]] of Southeast Asia were [[Indian maritime history|Indian maritime trade]] especially [[Spice trade]], emissaries of Ashoka, [[Ashoka#Buddhist_missions|Buddhist missions]] of [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka - the Great]], \n\n==Indian maritime with Southeast Asia==\n{{see also | Indian maritime history | Spice trade }}\n[[File:Indian ship on lead coin of Vashishtiputra Shri Pulumavi.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Indian ship on lead coin of [[Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi]], testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st\u20132nd century CE.]]\n\nThe first clear mention of a navy occurs in the mythological epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref name=Chakravarti>Chakravarti (1930)</ref> Historically, however, the first attested attempt to organise a navy in India, as described by [[Megasthenes]] (c. 350\u2014290 BCE), is attributed to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign 322\u2014298 BCE).<ref name=Chakravarti/> The [[Mauryan empire]] (322\u2013185 BCE) navy continued till the times of emperor [[Ashoka]] (reign 273\u201432 BCE), who used it to send massive diplomatic missions to Greece, [[Syria]], Egypt, [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]].<ref name=Chakravarti/> Following nomadic interference in [[Siberia]]\u2014one of the sources for India's bullion\u2014India diverted its attention to the [[Malay peninsula]], which became its new source for gold and was soon exposed to the world via a series of maritime [[trade route]]s.<ref name=shaffer309/> The period under the Mauryan empire also witnessed various other regions of the world engage increasingly in the Indian Ocean maritime voyages.<ref name=shaffer309 />\n\n=== Buddhist missions ===\nIn the Sri Lankan tradition, [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] \u2013 who is patronised by Ashoka \u2013 sends out nine Buddhist missions to spread Buddhism in the \"border areas\" in c. 250 BCE. This tradition does not credit Ashoka directly with sending these missions. Each mission comprises five monks, and is headed by an elder.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} To Sri Lanka, he sent his own son Mahinda, accompanied by four other Theras \u2013 Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}} Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Strong|1995|p=143}}\n\nThe Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=50}}\n\n* Mahinda to Sri Lanka\n* Majjhantika to Kashmir and Gandhara\n* Mahadeva to Mahisa-mandala (possibly modern Mysore region)\n* Rakkhita to Vanavasa\n* Dhammarakkhita the Greek to Aparantaka (western India)\n* Maha-dhamma-rakkhita to Maharashtra\n* Maharakkhita to the Greek country\n* Majjhima to the Himalayas\n* So\u1e47a and Uttara to Suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi (possibly Lower Burma and Thailand)\n\nThe tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Guruge, Unresolved|1995|p=51}}\n\n\nScholars, such as [[Erich Frauwallner]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=11}} According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the ''Vinaya Nidana'' mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at [[Bhilsa]] (near [[Vidisha]]). These caskets have been dated to early 2nd century BCE, and the inscription states that the monks are of the Himalayan school.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=10}} The missions may have set out from Vidisha in central India, as the caskets were discovered there, and as Mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nAccording to Gombrich, the mission may have included representatives of other religions, and thus, Lamotte's objection about \"dhamma\" is not valid. The Buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non-Buddhists, so as not to sideline Buddhism.{{sfn|Gombrich|1995|p=12}} Frauwallner and Gombrich also believe that Ashoka was directly responsible for the missions, since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities.

The Dharmaguptakas and the Sarvastivadins were two of the major Nikaya schools. These were both eventually displaced by the Mahayana, also known as \"Great Vehicle\". This movement of Buddhism first gained influence in the [[Khotan]] region.<ref name=\"Foltz 1999 38\"/> The Mahayana, which was more of a \"pan-Buddhist movement\" than a school of Buddhism, appears to have begun in northwestern India or Central Asia. It formed during the 1st century BCE and was small at first, and the origins of this \"Greater Vehicle\" are not fully clear. Some Mahayana scripts were found in northern Pakistan, but the main texts are still believed to have been composed in Central Asia along the Silk Road. These different schools and movements of Buddhism were a result of the diverse and complex influences and beliefs on the Silk Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=41}}</ref> With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, the initial direction of Buddhist development changed. This form of Buddhism highlighted, as stated by Xinru Liu, \"the elusiveness of physical reality, including material wealth.\" It also stressed getting rid of material desire to a certain point; this was often difficult for followers to understand.<ref>Xinru Liu, \"The Silk Road in World History\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 21.</ref>\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries CE, [[merchants]] played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, merchants supported Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road, and in return the Buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled.<ref>[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 43\u201344.</ref> Merchants also helped to establish [[diaspora]] within the communities they encountered, and over time their cultures became based on Buddhism.

Historians believe that there was a forerunner Indianised Hindu-Buddhist state to the present day Brunei Sultanate. One predecessor state was called Vijayapura, which possibly existed in northwest [[Borneo]] in the 7th century.{{efn|1=Not to be confused with the [[Vijayapura|Indian state of the same name]].}} It was probably a subject state of the powerful Indianised Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire based in [[Sumatra]].  One predecessor state was called Po-ni (pinyin: Boni).<ref>This view recently has been challenged. See Johannes L. Kurz \"Boni in Chinese Sources: Translations of Relevant Texts from the Song to the Qing Dynasties\", paper accessible under http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=172 (2006)</ref>  By the 10th century Po-ni had contacts with first the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasty and at some point even entered into a tributary relationship with China.  By the 14th century Po-ni also fell under the influence of the Indianised Hindu [[Java]]nese [[Majapahit]] Empire. The book of [[Nagarakretagama]], canto 14, written by Prapanca in 1365 mentioned ''Berune'' as a vassal state of Majahpahit.<ref>{{cite web | title=Naskah Nagarakretagama | publisher=Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia | url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523163555/http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | archive-date=23 May 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However this may have been nothing more than a symbolic relationship, as one account of the annual tribute owed each year to Majahpahit was a jar of [[areca]] juice obtained from the young green nuts of the areca palm. The Ming dynasty resumed communications with Po-ni in the 1370s and the Po-ni ruler Ma-na-jih-chia-na visited the Ming capital Nanjing in 1408 and died there; [[Tomb of the King of Boni|his tomb]] was rediscovered in the 20th century, and is now a protected monument.\n\n===Indianised Islamic sultanate (~1400 - present day)===\nIn 1402, [[Sultan Muhammad Shah]] died, he was first to convert from Hindu-Buddhism to Islam, and his pre-conversion name was Awang Alak Betatar.\n\n==Burma (Myanmar)==\nAt the western end of the South East Asian mainland, Lower Burma was occupied by the Mon peoples who are thought to have come originally from western China. In Lower Burma they supplanted an earlier people: the Pyu, of whom little is known except that they practised Hinduism. \n\n===Arrival of Buddhism and impact of Indian literature (3rd century CE onward)===\nThe Mons strongly influenced by their contacts with Indian traders during the 3rd century B.C adopted Indian literature and art and the Buddhist religion. The Mins were the earliest known civilization in Southeast Asia. They consisted of several Mon kingdoms, spreading from Lower Burma into much of Thailand, where they founded the kingdom of Dvaravati. Their principal settlements in Burma were Thaton and Pegu. \n\n===Tibeto-Burman Buddhist kingdoms (11th - 13th century CE )===\nFrom about the 9th century onward Tibeto-Burman tribes moved south from the hills east of Tibet into the Irrawaddy plain. They founded their capital at Pagan in Upper Burma in the 10th century. They eventually absorbed the Mons, their cities and adopted the Mon civilization and Buddhism. The Pagan kingdom united all Burma under one rule for 200 years - from the 11th to 13th centuries. The zenith of its power occurred during the reign of King Anawratha (1044\u20131077), who conquered the Mon kingdom\nof Thaton. King Anawratha built many of the temples for which Pagan is famous. It is estimated that some 13,000 temples once existed within the city, which some 5,000 still stand.\n\n===13th-21st century===\n{{empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Cambodia==\n===Funan===\n[[File:Siem Reap Reflections (CAMBODIA-REFLECTION-ANGKOR WAT) VI (1070423631).jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Angkor Wat]]]]\nThe first of these Hinduised states to achieve widespread importance was the [[Kingdom of Funan]] founded in the 1st century CE in what is now [[Cambodia]] \u2014 according to legend, after the marriage of a Brahman into the family of the local chief. These local inhabitants were [[Khmer people]]. Funan flourished for some 500 years. It carried on a prosperous trade with India and China, and its engineers developed an extensive canal system. An elite practised statecraft, art and science, based on Indian culture. Vassal kingdoms spread to southern Vietnam in the east and to the [[Malay Peninsula]] in the west.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Chenla and Angkor===\nIn late 6th century CE, dynastic struggles caused the collapse of the Funan empire. It was succeeded by another Hindu-Khmer state, Chen-la, which lasted until the 9th century. Then a [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] king, Jayavarman II (about 800-850) established a capital at [[Angkor]] in central Cambodia. He founded a cult which identified the king with the Hindu God Shiva \u2013 one of the triad of Hindu gods, Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, Shiva the god symbolising destruction and reproduction.  The Angkor empire flourished from the 9th to the early 13th century. It reached the peak of its fame under Jayavarman VII at the end of the 12th century, when its conquests extended into Thailand in the west (where it had conquered the Mon kingdom of Dwaravati) and into Champa in the east. Its most celebrated memorial is the great temple of [[Angkor Wat]], built early in the 12th century.  This summarises the position on the South East Asian mainland until about the 12th century. Meanwhile, from about the 6th century, and until the 14th century, there was a series of great maritime empires based on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. In early days these Indians came mostly from the ancient kingdom of Kalinga, on the south-eastern coast of India. Indians in Indonesia are still known as \"Klings\", derived from Kalinga.\n\n==East Timor==\nThe later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.<ref name=\"Taylor 2003 page 378\">{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |url=https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean/page/378 378]|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}</ref>\n\n===Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (3rd century ~ 16th century) ===\n{{main| History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia | Greater India | Indosphere | Indianisation }}\n\n====Earlier Buddhist era (3rd century BCE - 7th century) ====\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Indianised Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire (7th - 12th century) ====\n{{main| Srivijaya empire }}\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\nOral traditions of people of [[Wehali]] principality of East Timor mention their  migration from Sina Mutin Malaka or ''\"Chinese White [[Malacca]]\"'' (part of [[Indianization of Southeast Asia|Indianised]] Hindu-Buddhist [[Srivijaya empire]]) in ancient times.<ref>H.J.

In the islands of Southeast Asia the first organised state to achieve fame was the Hindu Malay kingdom of [[Srivijaya]], with its capital at Palembang in southern [[Sumatra]]. Its commercial pre-eminence was based on command of the sea route from India to China between Sumatra and the Malay peninsula (later known as the Straits of [[Malacca]]). In the 6th \u2013 7th centuries [[Srivijaya]] succeeded Funan as the leading state in Southeast Asia. Its ruler was the overlord of the Malay peninsula and western [[Java]] as well as [[Sumatra]]. Like most of the early kingdoms of Soutehast Asia, Srivijaya was Dravidian in culture and administration, and Buddhism became firmly entrenched there. \n\n===Sailendra kingdom===\nThe expansion of Srivijaya was resisted in eastern Java, where the powerful Buddhist [[Sailendra]] dynasty arose. (From the 7th century onwards there was great activity in temple building in eastern Java. The most impressive of the ruins is at Borobudur, considered to have been the largest Buddhist temple in the world.) Sailendra rule spread to southern Sumatra, and up to Malay peninsula to [[Cambodia]] (where it was replaced by the [[Angkor]] kingdom). In the 9th century, the Sailendras moved to Sumatra, and a union of Srivijaya and the Sailendras formed an empire which dominated much of Southeast Asia for the next five centuries. With the departure of the Sailendras a new Majapahit kingdom appeared in eastern Java, which reverted from Buddhism to Hinduism. After 500 Years of supremacy Srivijaya was superseded by Majapahit. The various Indianised states and empires of this first 1500 years CE, though founded by Indian colonisation and maintaining diplomatic contacts with India, remained politically independent of the Indian kingdoms. The only exception to this was the temporary conquest of Malaya by the [[Chola]] kingdom of southern India in the 11th century.\n\n===Mataram kingdom===\nIn the 10th century, Mataram, challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King [[Airlangga]] (c. 1020\u20131050), the kingdom split on his death; and the new state of Kediri, in eastern Java.\n\n===Kediri kingdom===\nKediri kingdom, spread its influence to the eastern part of Southeast Asia and became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries. The [[spice]] trade was now becoming of increasing importance, as the demand by European countries for spices grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the [[Maluku Islands]] (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and Kediri became a strong trading nation. \n\n===Singhasari kingdom===\nIn the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and [[Singhasari]] arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king [[Kertanegara]]. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, [[Majapahit]]. \n\n===Majapahit empire===\nBy the middle of the 14th century Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay peninsula, part of [[Borneo]], the southern Celebes and the Moluccas.

A 7th-century Indian drama, ''Kaumudhimahotsva'', refers to Kedah as Kataha-nagari. The ''Agnipurana'' also mentions a territory known as Anda-Kataha with one of its boundaries delineated by a peak, which scholars believe is [[Gunung Jerai]]. Stories from the ''Katasaritasagaram'' describe the elegance of life in Kataha. The Buddhist [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom|kingdom of Ligor]] took control of Kedah shortly after. Its king [[Chandrabhanu]] used it as a base to attack [[Sri Lanka]] in the 11th century and ruled the northern parts, an event noted in a stone inscription in Nagapattinum in [[Tamil Nadu]] and in the Sri Lankan chronicles, ''[[Mahavamsa]]''.\n\n=====Decline of Srivijaya empire and inner fights of breakup vassal states (12th - 13th century)=====\nAt times, the Khmer kingdom, the Siamese kingdom, and even Cholas kingdom tried to exert control over the smaller Malay states.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/> The power of Srivijaya declined from the 12th century as the relationship between the capital and its vassals broke down. Wars with the Javanese caused it to request assistance from China, and wars with Indian states are also suspected. In the 11th century, the centre of power shifted to [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]], a port possibly located further up the Sumatran coast near the [[Batang Hari River|Jambi River]].<ref name=\"History\"/> The power of the Buddhist Maharajas was further undermined by the [[The spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]]. Areas which were converted to Islam early, such as [[Aceh]], broke away from Srivijaya's control. By the late 13th century, the Siamese kings of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] had brought most of Malaya under their rule. In the 14th century, the Hindu Java-based [[Majapahit]] empire came into possession of the peninsula.<ref name=\"state.gov\"/>\n\n===Defeat and conversion to Islamic sultanates in 14th and 15th century===\nIn the 14th century that first [[Islam]]ic sultanate was established. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Islam had a profound influence on the [[Malay people]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and [[Southeast Asia]], capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at [[Jesselton]], [[Kuching]], [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] defined the boundaries between [[British Malaya]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.<ref>Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya: 1951 in C.C.

The ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'' (''Malay Annals'') contains a tale of a prince of [[Srivijaya]], Sri Tri Buana (also known as [[Sang Nila Utama]]), who landed on Temasek after surviving a storm in the 13th century. According to the tale, the prince saw a strange creature, which he was told was a [[Asiatic lion|lion]]; believing this to be an auspicious sign, he decided to found a settlement called Singapura, which means \"Lion City\" in [[Sanskrit]]. It is unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though [[tiger]]s continued to roam the island until the early 20th century. However, the lion motif is common in Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of the words for \"throne\" in the [[Malay language]] is \"singgasana\", meaning \"lion's seat\" in Sanskrit), and it has been speculated that the \"Singapura\" name, and the tale of the lion, were invented by court historians of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] to glorify Sang Nila Utama and his line of descent.<ref name=\"baker\">{{cite book | last = Baker | first = Jim | title = Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia | date = 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDifferent versions of its history are told in Portuguese sources, suggesting that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by  [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] from Palembang.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N.

Evidence of strong religious, cultural and linguistic links abound.\n\n===Propagation of Buddhism in Thailand by emperor Ashoka (3rd centure BCE)===\nHistorically, the cultural and economic interaction between the two countries can be traced to roughly around the 6th century B.C. The single most significant cultural contribution of India, for which Thailand is greatly indebted to India, is [[Buddhism]]. Propagated in Thailand in the 3rd century B.C. by Buddhist monks sent by [[King Asoka]], it was adopted as the state religion of Thailand and has ruled the hearts and minds of Thais ever since. Presently 58,000,000 Thais, an overwhelming 94% of the total Thai populace adheres to Buddhism. However, direct contact can be said to have begun only in the 3rd century B.C. when King Asoka sent Buddhist monks to propagate Buddhism in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Besides Buddhism, Thailand has also adopted other typically Indian religious and cultural traditions. The ceremonies and rites especially as regards the Monarchy evidence a strong Hindu influence.\n\n===Sukhothai period: Settlement of Indian traders and Brahmins in Thailand (1275\u20131350) ===\nThe Indians who moved into Thailand in the [[Sukhothai period]] (1275\u20131350) were either merchants who came to Siam or Thailand, for the purpose of trading or [[Brahmans]] who played an important role in the Siamese court as experts in astrology and in conducting ceremonies. The first group of Brahmans who entered Siam before the founding of Sukhothai as the first capital of Siam (1275\u20131350) popularized Hindu beliefs and traditions. During the Sukhothai period Brahman temples already existed. Brahmans conducted ceremonies in the court. The concepts of divine kingship and royal ceremonies are clear examples of the influence of Brahmanism.\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] are practiced more or less in its original form even up to the present reign. The Thai idea that the king is a reincarnation of the Hindu deity [[Vishnu]] was adopted from Indian tradition. (Though this belief no longer exists today, the tradition to call each Thai king of the present Chakri dynasty Rama (Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu) with an ordinal number, such as Rama I, Rama II etc. is still in practice.)\n\n===SukhAyutthaya period: Settlement of more Indian Tamil traders in Thailand (1350\u20131767 CE) ===\nIn the [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] era (1350\u20131767), more Tamil merchants entered the South of the country by boat as evidenced by the statues of Hindu gods excavated in the South.\n\n===Later migration of Indians to Thailand (1855 CE - present day) ===\nAfter the year 1855, the Tamils who migrated to Thailand can be classified into three groups according to the religion they believed in, namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. \n\n===Indian cultural influence on Thailand===\n====Dance====\n[[Thai literature]] and [[Thai art|drama]] draws great inspiration from [[Indian art]]s and [[Hindu mythology|legend]]. The Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] is as popular in Thailand as it is in India. Thailand has adapted the Ramayana to suit the Thai lifestyle in the past and has come up with its own version of the Ramayana, namely, the [[Ramakien]].\n\nTwo of the most popular classical dances the [[Khon]], performed by men wearing ferocious masks, and the [[Dance_in_Thailand#Lakhon|Lakhon]] ([[Lakhon nai]], [[Lakhon chatri]] and [[Lakhon nok]]), performed by women who play both male and female roles draws inspiration primarily from the Ramakien. Percussion instruments and [[Piphat]], a type of woodwind accompany the dance.<ref name=\"indthai\">http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Historical-Ties-India-and-Thailand-1.aspx</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are [[shadow play]] called [[nang talung]] in Thai. This is a show in which shadows of pieces of cow or water buffalo hide cut to represent human figures with movable arms and legs are thrown on a screen for the entertainment of spectators. In [[South India]], this kind of show is called Bommalattam.\n\n====Language====\n\n[[Thai language]] too bears close affinity with Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. An indication of the close linguistic affiliation between India and Thailand can be found in common Thai words like Ratha Mantri, Vidhya, Samuthra, Karuna, Prannee etc. which are almost identical to their Indian counterparts. Thai language basically consists of monosyllabic words that are individually complete in meaning. His Majesty King [[Ram Khamhaeng]] the Great created the [[Thai script|Thai alphabet]] in 1283. He modeled it on the ancient Indian alphabets of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] through the medium of the [[Khmer script|old Khmer characters]]. Like most world languages, the Thai language is a complicated mixture derived from several sources. Many Thai words used today were derived from [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], Khmer, Malay, English and Chinese.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Religious ceremonies and festivals====\nSeveral Thai ceremonies have been adopted from Indian tradition. These include ceremonies related to ordination, marriage, merit making and cremation. Though the Lord Buddha is the prime inspiration of Thailand, Brahma and other Hindu deities are widely worshipped among the Thais, due in part to the popularity of the Hindu ceremonial rites, which are used especially for royal ceremonies.\n\n(1) The '''[[Triyampawai ceremony|Triyampawai Ceremony]] or the Giant Swing Ceremony'''. Originally a [[Brahmin]] ceremony performed to pay homage to the God [[Shiva]], it was traditionally held front of [[Wat Suthat]], while the King and Queen watched the ceremony from a gold silk pavilion. Though the ceremony was abolished during the reign of King [[Rama VII]] due to a severe economic fall, Brahman priests are still allocated money to make offerings to God Shiva.\n\n(2) The '''[[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]]''', which is officiated by H.M. the king at [[Sanam Luang]] in May every year with pomp. Originally a Brahmanic rite, it was adopted to mark the beginning of the farming season as also to bless all farmers with fertility for the year.\n\n(3) The '''Royal Ceremony for preparing Celestial Rice''' or [[Glutinous_rice#Thai|Khao thip]] which was said to be originally prepared by celestial beings in honor of God Indra. A portion of the celestial rice is offered to monks while the remainder was divided in varying quantities among the royal family, courtiers and household members. The making of the ambrosial dish has come to a natural end since custom demanded that virgins alone should perform the preparation and stirring of celestial rice.\n\n(4) The '''[[Kathina]] Ceremony''' or the period during which Buddhist monks receive new robes, which generally falls in the months of October- November.\n\n(5) '''[[Loy Krathong]]''' \u2013 the Festival of Lights which is celebrated on the full moon night of the twelfth lunar month. The [[Loi Krathong|floating of Loi Krathong lanterns]], which began in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] period, continued throughout the different stages of Thai history. The present day understanding is that the festival is celebrated as an act of worship to [[Phra Mae Thorani|Chao Mae Kangka]], the Goddess of the Waters, for providing the water much needed throughout the year, and as a way of asking forgiveness if they have polluted it or used it carelessly.\n\n(6) '''[[Songkran]] Festival''': Songkran day marks Thai New Year day. \"Songkran\" signifies the sun's move into the first house of the zodiac. It is similar to Indian [[Holi]].\n\n(7) '''[[Vesak|Visakha]] Puja Day''' which is considered as the greatest Buddhist holy day as it commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of the Lord Buddha.\n\nOther famous ceremonial holy days include [[M\u0101gha P\u016bj\u0101|Magha Puja]] day, in February and [[Asalha Puja]] day in July which commemorates the day on which Lord Buddha delivered the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|First Sermon]] to his five disciples, namely, Konthanya, Vassapa, Bhattiya, [[Mahanama]] and Assashi at [[Sarnath|Esipatanamaruekathayawan]] (Isipatana forest at Sarnath in India) and there explained his concept of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (Ariyasai).<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Hindu astrology====\n[[Hindu astrology]] still has a great impact on several important stages of Thai life. Thai people still seek advice from knowledgeable Buddhist monks or Brahman astrologers about the auspicious or inauspicious days for conducting or abstaining from ceremonies for moving house or getting married.\n\n====Influence of Ayurveda on Thai traditional medicine and massage ====\nAccording to the Thai monk Venerable [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's writing, \u2018India's Benevolence to Thailand\u2019, the Thais also obtained the methods of making [[Ayurveda|herbal medicines]] (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like Sarabhi of [[Clusiaceae|Guttiferae family]], Kanika or [[Parijata|harsinghar]], phikun or [[Mimusops elengi]] and bunnak or the [[Mesua ferrea|rose chestnut]] etc. were brought from India.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n====Influence of Indian cuisine and spices on Thai cuisine ====\nThai monk [[Buddhadasa]] Bhikku's pointed out that [[Thai cuisine]] too was influenced by [[Indian cuisine]]. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use [[Ayurveda|spices]] in their food in various ways from Indians.<ref name=\"indthai\" />\n\n==Vietnam==\n===Early Chinese vassal states===\nAt the eastern extremity of mainland Southeast Asia, northern [[Vietnam]] was originally occupied by Austro-Asiatic peoples. However, when regional power structures shifted [[Baiyue|tribes from Southern China]] began to settle in these lands. About 207 BC, a Chinese general, taking advantage of the temporary fragmentation of the Chinese Empire on the collapse of the Ch\u2019in dynasty, created in northern Vietnam the kingdom of Annam. During the 1st century BC, Annam was incorporated in the Chinese Empire of the Han dynasty; and it remained a province of the empire until the fall of the T'ang dynasty early in the 10th century. It then regained its independence, often as a nominal Vassal of the Chinese Emperor.  \n\n===Establishment of Indianised Hindu kingdom of Champa by Indonesian rulers (10th century -) ===\nIn south-central Vietnam the Chams, a people of Indonesian stock, established the Hinduised kingdom of [[Champa]] c. 400. Subject to periodic invasions by the Annamese and by the Khmers of Cambodia, Champa survived and prospered. In 1471, a Vietnamese army of approximately 300,000, invaded Champa under Emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] (\u9ece\u8056\u5b97). The invasion began as a consequence of Cham King's [[B\u00e0n La Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n|Tr\u00e0 To\u00e0n]] attack on Vietnam in 1470. The Vietnamese committed genocide against the Cham slaughtering approximately 60,000. The Vietnamese destroyed, burnt and raided massive parts of Champa, seizing the entire kingdom. Thousands of Cham escaped to Cambodia, the remaining were forced to assimilate into [[Vietnamese culture]]. Today, only 80,000 Cham remain in Vietnam.\n\n===Influence of Indian-origin Buddhism on Vietnam via Chinese culture===\nVietnam, or then known as [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annam]] ([[wikt:\u5b89|\u5b89]] [[wikt:\u5357|\u5357]]; pinyin: \u0100nn\u00e1n), experienced little Hindu influence \u2013 usually via Champa. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries (except for Singapore and the Philippines), Vietnam was influenced by the Indian-origin religion Buddhism via the strong impact of [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of China]].\n\n==See also==\n* Spread of Indian influence\n** [[Greater India]]\n** [[Indosphere]]\n** [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]\n** [[Indianization of Southeast Asia]]\n\n* Trading routes\n** [[Maritime history of India]]\n** [[Silk route]]\n** [[Ancient maritime history]]\n\n* Other related\n** [[List of Southeast Asian leaders]]\n** [[Southeast Asian Games]]\n** [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]]\n** [[Tiger Cub Economies]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George C\u0153d\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

{"title_page": "LEAPS (finance)", "text_new": "{{Expert-subject|Finance & Investment|date=November 2008}} \nIn [[finance]], '''LEAPS''' (an [[acronym]] for ''Long Term Equity Anticipation Security'') are  [[Option (finance)|options]] of longer terms than other more common options. LEAPS are available on approximately 2500 equities and 20 indexes.  As with traditional short term options, LEAPS are available in two forms, [[Call_option|calls]] and [[Put_options|puts.]]\n\nOptions were originally created with expiry cycles of 3, 6, and 9 months, with no option term lasting more than a year. Options of this form, for such terms, still constitute the vast majority of options activity. LEAPS were created relatively recently and typically extend for terms of 2 years out. Equity LEAPS typically expire in January. For example, if today were November 2019, one could buy a Microsoft January call option that would expire in 2020, 2021, or 2022. The latter two are LEAPS.\n\nWhen LEAPS were first introduced in 1990, they were [[Derivative_(finance)|derivative]] instruments solely for [[stock]]s; however, more recently, equivalent instruments for [[index (economics)|indices]] have become available. These are also referred to as LEAPS.\n\n==Applications==\nLEAPS are often used as a risk reduction tool by investors.  For example, in an article in ''[[Stocks, Futures and Options Magazine]]'', Dan Haugh of [[PTI Securities & Futures]] suggests that stock investors can manage risk and price protection by considering purchase of an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) and \u201c..buying put protection on that ETF with LEAPS.\" <ref>[http://www.sfomag.com/article.aspx?ID=1363&issueID=c Diversification is not Enough,\u201d ''Stocks, Futures and Options Magazine'', June 2009]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the case of stocks, the risk reduction application is when the owner of the stock writes LEAPs on his holding.  The owner of the stock essentially creates the LEAP. The result at the expiry of the LEAP can be determined from its exercise price. (LEAPs are written for a wide variety of exercise prices.) If the stock closes below the exercise price, the buyer of the LEAP has lost what he spent to buy the LEAP.  If the close is higher than the exercise price, the LEAP typically will automatically be exercised by the broker.  The buyer can then sell the stock.  His cost of the stock to the LEAP buyer will be the cost of the LEAP plus the exercise price (and any commissions).  Most often the buyer of the LEAP is a speculator who hopes that the stock will rise enough in market price for him to make a profit when the LEAP expires.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Option (finance)]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cboe.com/products/leaps.aspx Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities (LEAPS) at CBOE]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n\n{{finance-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Options (finance)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expert-subject|Finance & Investment|date=November 2008}} \nIn [[finance]], '''LEAPS''' (an [[acronym]] for ''Long Term Equity Anticipation Security'') are  [[Option (finance)|options]] of longer terms than other more common options.

The latter two are LEAPS.\n\nWhen LEAPS were first introduced in 1990, they were [[Derivative_(finance)|derivative]] instruments solely for [[stock]]s; however, more recently, equivalent instruments for [[index (economics)|indices]] have become available. These are also referred to as LEAPS.\n\n==Applications==\nLEAPS are often used as a risk reduction tool by investors.  For example, in an article in ''[[Stocks, Futures and Options Magazine]]'', Dan Haugh of [[PTI Securities & Futures]] suggests that stock investors can manage risk and price protection by considering purchase of an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) and \u201c..buying put protection on that ETF with LEAPS.\" <ref>[http://www.sfomag.com/article.aspx?ID=1363&issueID=c Diversification is not Enough,\u201d Stocks, Futures and Options, June 2009]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the case of stocks, the risk reduction application is when the owner of the stock writes LEAPs on his holding.  The owner of the stock essentially creates the LEAP. The result at the expiry of the LEAP can be determined from its exercise price. (LEAPs are written for a wide variety of exercise prices.) If the stock closes below the exercise price, the buyer of the LEAP has lost what he spent to buy the LEAP.  If the close is higher than the exercise price, the LEAP typically will automatically be exercised by the broker.  The buyer can then sell the stock.  His cost of the stock to the LEAP buyer will be the cost of the LEAP plus the exercise price (and any commissions).  Most often the buyer of the LEAP is a speculator who hopes that the stock will rise enough in market price for him to make a profit when the LEAP expires.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Option (finance)]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cboe.com/products/leaps.aspx Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities (LEAPS) at CBOE]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n\n{{finance-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Options (finance)]]\n", "name_user": "Paradoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eApplications:more fixin'", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEAPS_(finance)"}

Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]].

He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]].

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

He received his medical education first at [[Glasgow University]] MB ChB 1907, and then on a sabbatical year in [[Chicago]] under the tutelage of Dr [[James Tyler Kent]] of Hering Medical College during 1908-9, along with Drs Harold Fergie Woods (1883\u20131961) and Douglas Borland (1885\u20131961).\n\nHe returned to the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] as Consultant Physician in 1910, and was appointed the Compton-Burnett Professor of Materia Medica in 1911. He rose to become President of the Faculty of Homeopathy in 1923.\n\nWeir reputedly first learned of homeopathy through his contact with Dr Robert Gibson Miller (1862\u20131919) head of the [[NHS Centre for Integrative Care, Glasgow|Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital]], who had an important influence on the future Physician Royal, who he treated for boils and converted to homeopathy [Bodman, 1971]. \"It was Dr Gibson Miller who advised Sir John Weir to go to the United States.\" [Stewart, 1967, p.&nbsp;260] This influence tended to be passed on: Dr Douglas Gibson (1888\u20131977) \"became interested in homeopathy in 1936 through a meeting with Sir John Weir,\" [Gibson obit, 1977, 225].\n\nHe spoke on homeopathy before the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in 1932, and was knighted by King George V that same year.
