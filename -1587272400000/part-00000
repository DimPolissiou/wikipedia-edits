He started playing clarinet at the age of twelve and six years later won the clarinet competition of the renowned German classical music award \u201cJugend musiziert\u201d. At the age of 14, he started rowing and later raced successfully in quads and double sculls. He graduated by the German Abitur in fall 1966, followed by two years of service in the German military. While already attending medical school, he also received training as an engineer specialized in hearing aids, and graduated by the German Gesellenpruefung.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Career==\nWittig studied Medicine at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin from 1968 to 1975. While he was still studying medicine, he joined laboratories at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry ''(Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Biochemie)'' of the Freie Universitaet Berlin and at the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]], to perform the experimental work for his doctoral thesis. His principal thesis advisor was molecular biologist {{ill|Hubert Gottschling|de}} with influential mentoring by V.A. Erdmann, O. Pongs, H.-J. Risse, H. Tiedemann and H.G. Wittmann. Wittig successfully defended his thesis \u201cPurification and Characterization of the Four Lysine-Specific Transfer Ribonucleic Acids from Chicken Embryos\u201d ''(Reinigung und Charakterisierung der vier lysinspezifischen Transfer-Ribonukleins\u00e4uren aus H\u00fchnerembryonen)'' in 1976. He continued at Freie Universitaet Berlin, first as a postdoc (1976-1978) and later as an assistant professor (1978-1987).\n\nBetween 1976 and 1986, in addition to his work as a researcher, Wittig attended a variety of physics courses as a visiting student at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin (FUB), Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin (TUB), California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to widen his scientific horizon. He received no official degree for these classes.\n\nIn 1980 Wittig habilitated for \u201cBiochemistry and Molecular Biology\u201d and became formally eligible for a full professorship in Germany.\n\nWittig was awarded a [http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/heisenberg/index.html Heisenberg scholarship] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)]] in 1982/83 and worked as a fellow of the program until 1989.

One year later, Wittig was tenured (C4, German Full Professorship) as founding chair and department head of [[Molecular biology|Molecular Biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]] at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Biochemie) at [[Freie Universitaet Berlin]].\n\nBy political administration and change of Berlin law (Berliner Universitaetsmedizingesetz) his institute became an entity of the fused medical faculties of [[Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin|FUB]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universitaet]] zu Berlin, now named [[Charit\u00e9]] \u2013 Universitaetsmedizin. Wittig served as Director of this new Institute of Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics until 2010.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Wittig focused his research on the design, development, and clinical proof-of-concept of covalently closed DNA constructs for the treatment of [[cancer]] and for [[DNA vaccination|DNA-vaccines]] against [[infectious diseases]]. Two classes of DNA-molecules evolved through theoretical and experimental selection processes and became key technologies; MIDGE (minimalistic, immunogenically defined gene expression), and dSLIM for DNA-based immunomodulation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.biocentury.com/biotech-pharma-news/products/2003-07-14/product-development-dslimming-the-immune-system-a12a|title=dSLIMming the immune system|work=BioCentury|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo enable the independent transition from basic research to clinical DNA medicines, he founded Mologen AG in 1998.

He started playing clarinet at the age of twelve and six years later won the clarinet competition of the renowned German classical music award \u201cJugend musiziert\u201d. At the age of 14, he started rowing and later raced successfully in quads and double sculls. He graduated by the German Abitur in fall 1966, followed by two years of service in the German military. While already attending medical school, he also received training as an engineer specialized in hearing aids, and graduated by the German Gesellenpruefung.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Career==\nWittig studied Medicine at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin from 1968 to 1975. While he was still studying medicine, he joined laboratories at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry ''(Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Biochemie)'' of the Freie Universitaet Berlin and at the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]], to perform the experimental work for his doctoral thesis. His principal thesis advisor was molecular biologist {{ill|Hubert Gottschling|de}} with influential mentoring by V.A. Erdmann, O. Pongs, H.-J. Risse, H. Tiedemann and H.G. Wittmann. Wittig successfully defended his thesis \u201cPurification and Characterization of the Four Lysine-Specific Transfer Ribonucleic Acids from Chicken Embryos\u201d ''(Reinigung und Charakterisierung der vier lysinspezifischen Transfer-Ribonukleins\u00e4uren aus H\u00fchnerembryonen)'' in 1976. He continued at Freie Universitaet Berlin, first as a postdoc (1976-1978) and later as an assistant professor (1978-1987).\n\nBetween 1976 and 1986, in addition to his work as a researcher, Wittig attended a variety of physics courses as a visiting student at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin (FUB), Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin (TUB), California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to widen his scientific horizon. He received no official degree for these classes.\n\nIn 1980 Wittig habilitated for \u201cBiochemistry and Molecular Biology\u201d and became formally eligible for a full professorship in Germany.\n\nWittig was awarded a [http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/heisenberg/index.html Heisenberg scholarship] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)]] in 1982/83 and worked as a fellow of the program until 1989. During this time, he was invited by scholars [[Edward Trifonov]], [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Rehovot, and the late Koki Horikoshi, [[Riken|Riken Institute]] ([https://www.jst.go.jp/erato/en/research_area/completed/htkb_P.html ERATO superbug project]).\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986,  he was a visiting professor at [[Alexander Rich]]\u2019s lab at MIT and also cooperated with [[Alexander Varshavsky]]; in Wittig's own words \u201centering the most career-shaping times of his life\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Shuguang|last2=Wittig|first2=Burghardt|date=2015-06-01|title=Alexander Rich 1924\u20132015|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=6|pages=593\u2013598|doi=10.1038/nbt.3262|pmid=26057974|issn=1087-0156}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Freie Universitaet Berlin awarded Wittig an extraordinary professorship (\u201cau\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfige Professur\u201c). He continued to work as a visiting professor at MIT in  Rich's lab until 1989, when he became a full professor (S-C4, tenure) at Freie Universitaet Berlin (FUB) and was awarded the Schering Professorship of FUB. One year later, Wittig was tenured (C4, German Full Professorship) as founding chair and department head of [[Molecular biology|Molecular Biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]] at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie und Biochemie) at [[Freie Universitaet Berlin]].\n\nBy political administration and change of Berlin law (Berliner Universitaetsmedizingesetz) his institute became an entity of the fused medical faculties of [[Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin|FUB]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universitaet]] zu Berlin, now named [[Charit\u00e9]] \u2013 Universitaetsmedizin. Wittig served as Director of this new Institute of Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics until 2010.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Wittig focused his research on the design, development, and clinical proof-of-concept of covalently closed DNA constructs for the treatment of [[cancer]] and for [[DNA vaccination|DNA-vaccines]] against [[infectious diseases]]. Two classes of DNA-molecules evolved through theoretical and experimental selection processes and became key technologies; MIDGE (minimalistic, immunogenically defined gene expression), and dSLIM for DNA-based immunomodulation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.biocentury.com/biotech-pharma-news/products/2003-07-14/product-development-dslimming-the-immune-system-a12a|title=dSLIMming the immune system|work=BioCentury|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo enable the independent transition from basic research to clinical DNA medicines, he founded Mologen AG in 1998.
