Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of record or record-equalling passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 100-day passage in 1854. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including a record 1855 passage that stood for many years. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of record or record-equalling passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 100-day passage in 1854. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including a record 1855 passage that stood for many years. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

The elections were participated in by the leading opposition party, the [[Lakas ng Bayan]] (LABAN), which had twenty-one candidates for the Metro Manila area while the leading candidate was the jailed opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]], and the Marcos regime's party known as the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (KBL), which was led by the then-First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]]. Ninoy was allowed to run by his fellow partymates under the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], who boycotted the election and was not allowed to campaign, and so his family campaigned for him. The night before the election on April 6, 1978, a noise barrage was organized by the supporters of (LABAN) which occurred up to dawn.\n\nThese elections were followed by the [[1978 Philippine parliamentary sectoral election|sectoral election]] on April 27, which elected additional 14 representatives. Another 10 representatives were appointed, bringing up the total number of representatives to 189.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Philippines had been under [[martial law]] since 1972, with incumbent president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] ruling by decree. Prior to this, the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] was being drafted by the [[1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention|Constitutional Convention]], whose delegates were [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|elected in 1970]]. The Constitutional Convention approved the final draft of the constitution, which consisted of the abolition of the Philippine Congress and its replacement with an interim National Assembly consisting of the President, the Vice-President, the President of the Constitutional Convention, and members of the Senate and the House of Representatives in November 1972 and was [[1973 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|later ratified]] on January 17, 1973 through so-called \"citizens' assemblies\". The Constitution was amended twice, on [[1973 Philippine Martial Law referendum|July 27\u201328, 1973]] and [[1975 Philippine executive and legislative powers referendum|February 27\u201328, 1975]]. The Constitution was amended once again on [[1976 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|October 16\u201317, 1976]] with the passage of \"Amendment No. 6\", which changed the name of the Interim National Assembly into the \"Interim Batasang Pambansa\", more commonly as the \"Batasan\".\n\n== Campaign ==\n=== Lakas ng Bayan ===\n{{Main|Lakas ng Bayan}}\nIn 1978, from his prison cell, Aquino was allowed to take part in the elections. Although his friends, former Senators [[Gerardo Roxas|Gerry Roxas]] and [[Jovito Salonga]], preferred to boycott the elections, Aquino urged his supporters to field 21 candidates in [[Metro Manila]]. Thus, his political party, dubbed ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]'' (\"People's Power\"), was born. The party's acronym was \"LABAN\" (\"fight\" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]). He was entitled to one television interview on [[People's Television Network|GTV]]'s ''Face the Nation'' (hosted by [[Ronnie Nathanielsz]]), and proved to a startled and impressed populace that imprisonment had neither dulled his rapier-like tongue nor dampened his fighting spirit. Foreign correspondents and diplomats asked what would happen to the LABAN ticket. People agreed with him that his party would win overwhelmingly in an honest election. On April 6, 1978, supporters of the [[Lakas ng Bayan]] (LABAN), the opposition party headed by former Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] who was still in jail and twenty other candidates contesting the Region IV-A (Metro Manila) seats, came out in protest by asking bystanders and cars to make noise in support the opposition.\n\n=== Kilusang Bagong Lipunan ===\nPresident Marcos created the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (New Society Movement) as his political vehicle for the elections.\n\n== Results ==\nThe top bar represents seats won, while the bottom bar represents the proportion of votes received.\n{| width=70% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|+ \u2193\n|-align=center\n|style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\" width=87.30%|'''District'''\n|style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\" width=12.70%|'''Other'''\n|-\n|\n{|width=100% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:90%;\"\n|width=90.90% bgcolor={{Kilusang Bagong Lipunan/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">150</span>\n|width=7.88% bgcolor={{Pusyon Bisaya/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">13</span>\n|width=0.61% bgcolor={{Mindanao Alliance/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">1</span>\n|width=0.61% bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}|1\n|}\n|\n{|width=100% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:90%;\"\n|width=58.33% bgcolor=#36454F|<span style=\"color:white;\">14</span>\n|width=41.67% bgcolor=gray|<span style=\"color:white;\">10</span>\n|}\n|-\n|\n{|width=100% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:90%;\"\n|width=74.97% bgcolor={{Kilusang Bagong Lipunan/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">74.97%</span>\n|width=10.36% bgcolor={{Lakas ng Bayan/meta/color}}|10.36%\n|width=4.57% bgcolor={{Pusyon Bisaya/meta/color}}|\n|width=3.22% bgcolor={{Mindanao Alliance/meta/color}}|\n|width=3.67% bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}|\n|style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" width=3.22%|\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; text-align:center\"\n|<span style=\"color:{{Kilusang Bagong Lipunan/meta/color}};\">'''KBL'''</span>\n|<span style=\"color:{{Lakas ng Bayan/meta/color}};\">'''LABAN'''</span>\n|{{ref label|a|1|1}}\n|{{ref label|b|2|2}}\n|{{ref label|c|3|3}}\n|{{ref label|d|4|4}}\n|}\n|\n{|width=100%\n|-align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|width=58.33% bgcolor=#36454F|<span style=\"color:#36454F;\">.</span>\n|width=41.67% bgcolor=gray|\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; text-align:center\"\n|{{ref label|e|5|5}}\n|{{ref label|f|6|6}}\n|}\n|}{{refbegin}}\n:{{note label|a|1|1}} Pusyon Bisaya: 4.57%\n:{{note label|b|2|2}} Mindanao Alliance: 3.22%\n:{{note label|c|3|3}} Independents: 3.67%\n:{{note label|d|4|4}} No seats won: 3.22%\n:{{note label|e|5|5}} Sectoral seats: unknown votes\n:{{note label|f|6|6}} Appointed seats\n{{refend}}\n\n=== District elections ===\n{{electiontable|Philippine parliamentary election, 1978|Summary of the April 7, 1978 [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] election results}}\n|-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" \n!rowspan=2 colspan=2 style=\"text-align:left;\" |Party\n!colspan=3|Popular vote\n!colspan=3|Seats won\n|-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" \n!Total !! % !!

The elections were participated in by the leading opposition party, the [[Lakas ng Bayan]] (LABAN), which had twenty-one candidates for the Metro Manila area while the leading candidate was the jailed opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]], and the Marcos regime's party known as the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (KBL), which was led by the then-First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]]. Ninoy was allowed to run by his fellow partymates under the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], who boycotted the election and was not allowed to campaign, and so his family campaigned for him. The night before the election on April 6, 1978, a noise barrage was organized by the supporters of (LABAN) which occurred up to dawn.\n\nThese elections were followed by the [[1978 Philippine parliamentary sectoral election|sectoral election]] on April 27, which elected additional 14 representatives. Another 10 representatives were appointed, bringing up the total number of representatives to 189.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Philippines had been under [[martial law]] since 1972, with incumbent president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] ruling by decree. Prior to this, the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] was being drafted by the [[1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention|Constitutional Convention]], whose delegates were [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|elected in 1970]]. The Constitutional Convention approved the final draft of the constitution, which consisted of the abolition of the Philippine Congress and its replacement with an interim National Assembly consisting of the President, the Vice-President, the President of the Constitutional Convention, and members of the Senate and the House of Representatives in November 1972 and was [[1973 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|later ratified]] on January 17, 1973 through so-called \"citizens' assemblies\". The Constitution was amended twice, on [[1973 Philippine Martial Law referendum|July 27\u201328, 1973]] and [[1975 Philippine executive and legislative powers referendum|February 27\u201328, 1975]]. The Constitution was amended once again on [[1976 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|October 16\u201317, 1976]] with the passage of \"Amendment No. 6\", which changed the name of the Interim National Assembly into the \"Interim Batasang Pambansa\", more commonly as the \"Batasan\".\n\n== Campaign ==\n=== Lakas ng Bayan ===\n{{Main|Lakas ng Bayan}}\nIn 1978, from his prison cell, Aquino was allowed to take part in the elections. Although his friends, former Senators [[Gerardo Roxas|Gerry Roxas]] and [[Jovito Salonga]], preferred to boycott the elections, Aquino urged his supporters to field 21 candidates in [[Metro Manila]]. Thus, his political party, dubbed ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]'' (\"People's Power\"), was born. The party's acronym was \"LABAN\" (\"fight\" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]). He was entitled to one television interview on [[People's Television Network|GTV]]'s ''Face the Nation'' (hosted by [[Ronnie Nathanielsz]]), and proved to a startled and impressed populace that imprisonment had neither dulled his rapier-like tongue nor dampened his fighting spirit. Foreign correspondents and diplomats asked what would happen to the LABAN ticket. People agreed with him that his party would win overwhelmingly in an honest election. On April 6, 1978, supporters of the [[Lakas ng Bayan]] (LABAN), the opposition party headed by former Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] who was still in jail and twenty other candidates contesting the Region IV-A (Metro Manila) seats, came out in protest by asking bystanders and cars to make noise in support the opposition.\n\n=== Kilusang Bagong Lipunan ===\nPresident Marcos created the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (New Society Movement) as his political vehicle for the elections.\n\n== Results ==\nThe top bar represents seats won, while the bottom bar represents the proportion of votes received.\n{| width=70% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|+ \u2193\n|-align=center\n|style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\" width=87.30%|'''District'''\n|style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\" width=12.70%|'''Other'''\n|-\n|\n{|width=100% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:90%;\"\n|width=90.90% bgcolor={{Kilusang Bagong Lipunan/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">150</span>\n|width=7.88% bgcolor={{Pusyon Bisaya/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">13</span>\n|width=0.61% bgcolor={{Mindanao Alliance/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">1</span>\n|width=0.61% bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}|1\n|}\n|\n{|width=100% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:90%;\"\n|width=58.33% bgcolor=#36454F|<span style=\"color:white;\">14</span>\n|width=41.67% bgcolor=gray|<span style=\"color:white;\">10</span>\n|}\n|-\n|\n{|width=100% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:90%;\"\n|width=74.97% bgcolor={{Kilusang Bagong Lipunan/meta/color}}|<span style=\"color:white;\">74.97%</span>\n|width=10.36% bgcolor={{Lakas ng Bayan/meta/color}}|10.36%\n|width=4.57% bgcolor={{Pusyon Bisaya/meta/color}}|\n|width=3.22% bgcolor={{Mindanao Alliance/meta/color}}|\n|width=3.67% bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}|\n|style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" width=3.22%|\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; text-align:center\"\n|<span style=\"color:{{Kilusang Bagong Lipunan/meta/color}};\">'''KBL'''</span>\n|<span style=\"color:{{Lakas ng Bayan/meta/color}};\">'''LABAN'''</span>\n|{{ref label|a|1|1}}\n|{{ref label|b|2|2}}\n|{{ref label|c|3|3}}\n|{{ref label|d|4|4}}\n|}\n|\n{|width=100%\n|-align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|width=58.33% bgcolor=#36454F|<span style=\"color:#36454F;\">.</span>\n|width=41.67% bgcolor=gray|\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; text-align:center\"\n|{{ref label|e|5|5}}\n|{{ref label|f|6|6}}\n|}\n|}{{refbegin}}\n:{{note label|a|1|1}} Pusyon Bisaya: 4.57%\n:{{note label|b|2|2}} Mindanao Alliance: 3.22%\n:{{note label|c|3|3}} Independents: 3.67%\n:{{note label|d|4|4}} No seats won: 3.22%\n:{{note label|e|5|5}} Sectoral seats: unknown votes\n:{{note label|f|6|6}} Appointed seats\n{{refend}}\n\n=== District elections ===\n{{electiontable|Philippine parliamentary election, 1978|Summary of the April 7, 1978 [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] election results}}\n|-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" \n!rowspan=2 colspan=2 style=\"text-align:left;\" |Party\n!colspan=3|Popular vote\n!colspan=3|Seats won\n|-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" \n!Total !! % !!

[[National Library of New Zealand|Alexander Turnbull Library]], [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].]]\n[[Australia]] has over 160 grape varieties distrbuted on 146,244 hectares (ha) across all six states, [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] (see [[Australian wine]]). These activities are concentrated in the southern part of the continent and only where the ''[[terroir]]'' - that is, [[Soil|soil types]], [[Microclimate|local climate]], [[Irrigation|availability of irrigation]] and so on - is suited to viticulture.<ref>Jones, Gregory. \"Climate, Grapes, and Wine: Terroir and the Importance of Climate to Winegrape Production.\" GuildSomm, 12 August 2015.[https://www.guildsomm.com/public_content/features/articles/b/gregory_jones/posts/climate-grapes-and-wine] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref>\n\nTogether, the three sectors of the industry, [[Viticulture|grape growing]], [[winemaking]] and [[Enotourism|wine tourism]], play a major role in Australia's economy.

Included in this latter category are: transport companies; metal fabricators (eg manufacturers of stainless steel tanks); manufacturers of viticultural machinery; label manufacturers; suppliers of fertilisers and chemicals; consultants specialising in viticulture services; accounting and legal firms; and suppliers of packaging materials.\" (''Winegrape and Wine Industry in Australia: A Report by the Committee of Inquiry into the Winegrape and Wine Industry'', June 1995. pp. 72-73.[https://www.pc.gov.au/research/supporting/wine-grape/winegrap.pdf] Accessed 7 April 2020.)</blockquote></ref>\n\n==Wine grape varieties overview==\nAs of 2018<ref>Karlsson, Britt. \"Australia\u2019s most popular grape varieties.\" Edited by Britt and Per Karlsson.

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product.

(See Tischelmayer, \"Traminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/traminer], \"Gew\u00fcrtztraminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/gewurztraminer] and \"Savagnin Rose.\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/savagnin-rose] \n\nRobinson teases this out further in a chapter entitled \"Savagnin\" where she says:<blockquote>\u201cToday Savagnin shows a considerable level of clonal diversity, seen in berry colour, aroma, leaf shape, cluster size and so on. Several of these forms have often been mistakenly considered to be distinct varieties, eg Gew\u00fcrztraminer in Alsace and Germany; Heida or Pa\u00efen in Switzerland; Traminer or Traminer Weisser in Germany; Traminer Aromatico in Trentino-Alto Adige in Italy. Yet DNA profiling has shown that they all have the same genetic fingerprint, with the exception of some minor clonal genetic differences, and that they all correspond to the same variety (Regner et al. 2000a; Imazio et al. 2002). It is consequently misleading to talk about a \u2018Savagnin family\u2019 or a \u2018Traminer family\u2019 because this suggests family ties such as parent\u2013offspring, uncle\u2013nephew, cousins.</blockquote><blockquote>\u201cFor that reason, the most significant clonal mutations of this variety will be discussed as subsections within this Savagnin entry: the white-yellow-berried Savagnin Blanc, the pink-berried Savagnin Rose and the pink-berried, aromatic Gew\u00fcrztraminer, in chronological order of appearance in the literature.

Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

(See Tischelmayer, \"Traminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/traminer], \"Gew\u00fcrtztraminer\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/gewurztraminer] and \"Savagnin Rose.\"[https://glossary.wein-plus.eu/savagnin-rose] \n\nRobinson teases this out further in a chapter entitled \"Savagnin\" where she says:<blockquote>\u201cToday Savagnin shows a considerable level of clonal diversity, seen in berry colour, aroma, leaf shape, cluster size and so on. Several of these forms have often been mistakenly considered to be distinct varieties, eg Gew\u00fcrztraminer in Alsace and Germany; Heida or Pa\u00efen in Switzerland; Traminer or Traminer Weisser in Germany; Traminer Aromatico in Trentino-Alto Adige in Italy. Yet DNA profiling has shown that they all have the same genetic fingerprint, with the exception of some minor clonal genetic differences, and that they all correspond to the same variety (Regner et al. 2000a; Imazio et al. 2002). It is consequently misleading to talk about a \u2018Savagnin family\u2019 or a \u2018Traminer family\u2019 because this suggests family ties such as parent\u2013offspring, uncle\u2013nephew, cousins.</blockquote><blockquote>\u201cFor that reason, the most significant clonal mutations of this variety will be discussed as subsections within this Savagnin entry: the white-yellow-berried Savagnin Blanc, the pink-berried Savagnin Rose and the pink-berried, aromatic Gew\u00fcrztraminer, in chronological order of appearance in the literature.

The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (detail).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of the [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang United Irish insurgent Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]]\u2014and by \"the terrifying speed\" with which peasant insurrection in the South had degenerated into attacks upon Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=S.J. |title=Belfast 400: People, Place  and History |publisher=Liverpool University Press |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Improving Town, 1750-1820 |isbn=978-1-84631-635-7 |pages=192}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament which, having refused every call for reform, \"they had in any case little cause to lament.\"<ref>Connolly (2012), p. 292</ref> The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File: Catholic Emancipation.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament\u2014and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Inventing the Nation: Ireland |last=Comerford |first=R.V. |publisher=Arnold |year=2003 |isbn=0-340-73112-5 |location=London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History |last=Elliott |first=Marianne |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-920693-3 |location=Oxford |page=38}}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923 |last=Beckett |first=J.C. |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=1966 |isbn=0-571-09267-5 |location=London |pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Voice for Ireland: The Famine in the Land.

Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Atlas of Irish History |last=Duffy |first=Sean |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1997 |isbn=0-7171-2479-7 |location=Dublin |pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892.jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction\u2014toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North\u2014textiles, engineering, shipbuilding\u2014for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book |title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922 |last=MacRaild |first=Donald |publisher=Macmillan |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-312-22032-7 |location=London}}</ref>\u2014to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922 |last=Buckland |first=Patrick |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1973 |location=London |pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .  Orangemen . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour|Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J.

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm |title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day |accessdate=29 September 2012 |author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been\u2014as Carson later accounted it\u2014a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/ |title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \"typical Irishman\"\u2018 |last=archive.org |website=www.sluggerotoole.com |language=en-GB |access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland. Sinn Fein sweeps the south and west]]\nWith the Nationalists seeking to match the Ulster Volunteers by drilling and arming of [[National Volunteers]], in July 1914 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] called the parties to a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|conference of Buckingham Palace]].  The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4, 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition |last=Hennessey |first=Thomas |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |location=London |pages=72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side. Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923 |last=Laffan |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-139-10684-9}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy. But the decision of the Lloyd George and his Cabinet to simultaneously introduce conscription to Ireland--in effect, to make the first order of an Irish government cooperation in the impressment of men for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]--ruined the credibility of the proposal  with nationalists<ref>[[Stephen Gwynn|Gwynn, Stephen]] (1919), ''John Redmond's last Years'' Ch.

He proposed a United Kingdom federation of England, Scotland, Ulster and the South of Ireland. But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]]. (Joining \"Red Glasgow\" in the demand for a ten hour reduction in the work week, early in 1919 Belfast shipyard and engineering workers sustained the largest and longest walk out in the history of the city).<ref>{{cite news |title=Belfast strike of 1919 paved the way for shorter working week |last=Holland |first=Mairead |url=http://www.irishnews.com/paywall/tsb/irishnews/irishnews/irishnews//news/northernirelandnews/2019/01/28/news/belfast-strike-of-1919-paved-the-way-for-shorter-working-week-1537160/content.html |work=Irish News |date=28 January 2019 |accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Revolutionary Government in Ireland |last=Mitchell |first=Arthur |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1995 |location=Dublin |isbn=0-7171-2015-5 |pages=310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\").<ref>Hansard (Vol 127, cc 925-1036 925), House of Commons, 29 March 1920</ref> The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics |last=Mathews |first=Kevin |publisher=University College Dublin Press |year=2004 |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-904558-05-7 |pages=310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK) |Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964 |last=Lawrence |first=R.J.. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1965 |location=Oxford |pages=40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Dudley Edwards |first=Ruth |title=Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis |newspaper=The Times |date=29 May 2005 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first acts of Northern Ireland legislature was to scrap [[proportional representation]] (PR), prescribed for all Irish elections 1919. Preference voting was seen as having assisted nationalists to the control of a large number of local and district councils including, in a \"blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]],<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref> authorities which then pledged themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement (which had displaced Unionist councillors in Belfast) was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy |last=Kingsley |first=Paul |publisher=Belfast Publications |year=1989 |location=Belfast |isbn=0-9515549-0-5 |pages=19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref>{{cite web |title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/ |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London\u2014understood as a reward for the province's wartime service\u2014to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Northern Ireland |last=Buckland |first=Patrick |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1981 |location=Dublin |isbn=978-0-7171-1069-8 |pages=83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title=Ulster at the Crossroads |last=O'Neill |first=Terence |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=1969 |location=London |pages=11}}</ref>\n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref>\n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict |last=Patterson |first=Henry |publisher=Penguin |year=2006 |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-84488-104-8 |pages=126\u2013129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy. Speaking to Labour MPs in London, [[John Hume]] suggested that \"the plan\" was \"to develop the strongly Unionist-Belfast-Coleraine-Portadown triangle and to cause a migration from West to East Ulster, redistributing and scattering the minority to that the Unionist Party will not only maintain but strengthen its position.\"<ref>''Derry Journal'', 6 August 1965, cited in Kingsley (1989) pp. 98-99</ref>\n\nHume, a teacher from Derry, presented himself as a spokesman for an emerging \"third force\": a \"generation of younger Catholics in the North\" frustrated with a \"flags and slogans\" nationalism whose seeming indifference to \"the general welfare of Northern Ireland\" had made \"the task of Unionist ascendancy simpler.\" Determined to engage the \"great social problems of housing, unemployment and emigration\", these new \"political wanderers\" were willing to acknowledge that \"the Protestant tradition in the North is as strong and as legitimate\" as their own (if \"a man wishes Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom [that] does not necessarily make him a bigot or a discriminator\") and that Irish unity, \"if it is to come,\" could be achieved only \"by the will of the Northern majority.\"<ref>John Hume (1964), \"The Northern Catholic I\", ''The Irish Times'' (May 18 ), cited in part in Kingsley (1989) pp. 121-123</ref> Although they appeared to meet Unionists half way, Hume and those who joined him in what he proposed would be \"the emergence of normal politics\" presented the Unionist government with a new challenge. Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism.\n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], a broad labour and republican grouping with [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland|Communist Party]] veteran [[Betty Sinclair]] as chair. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles |last1=Prince |first1=Simon |last2=Warner |first2=Geoffrey |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2019 |location=New Bridge, Ireland |isbn=978-1-78855-093-2 |pages=34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]].\n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/ |title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical |website=ianpaisley.org |language=en |access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed.\n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more.

Already in the mid-1980s [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] President [[Gerry Adams]] was pointing to the involvement of the [[Wolfe Tone Societies|Wolf Tone Clubs]] in [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|NICRA]], and arguing that human rights had always been an integral part of the republican struggle.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Politics of Irish Freedom |last=Adams |first=Gerry |year=1986 |publisher=Brandon Books |isbn=0-86322-084-3 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nGiven that it appears to extenuate the republican resort to terrorism, Unionists have tended to reject the civil-rights account of the Troubles in almost every particular. in the late 1960s [[Ian Paisley|Paisley]] was not alone is dismissing talk of civil rights as much \"cant\" behind which stood preparations for a renewed armed campaign. There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society |location=Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and\u2014Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson.

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and those they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book |last=Northern Ireland Office |year=1972 |title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland |pages=140 |location=London |publisher= HMSO}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]].

At Westminster unionist MPs contended with governments that remained committed to the principles of the 1972 Green Paper. A brief honeymoon with the Thatcher government ended with the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. The initiative in protesting what unionists often perceived as inadequate political and security responses to republican violence passed to loyalists.

The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (detail).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of the [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang United Irish insurgent Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]]\u2014and by \"the terrifying speed\" with which peasant insurrection in the South had degenerated into attacks upon Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=S.J. |title=Belfast 400: People, Place  and History |publisher=Liverpool University Press |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Improving Town, 1750-1820 |isbn=978-1-84631-635-7 |pages=192}}</ref>\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923 |last=Beckett |first=J.C. |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=1966 |isbn=0-571-09267-5 |location=London |pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Voice for Ireland: The Famine in the Land.

Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Atlas of Irish History |last=Duffy |first=Sean |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1997 |isbn=0-7171-2479-7 |location=Dublin |pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892.jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction\u2014toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North\u2014textiles, engineering, shipbuilding\u2014for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book |title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922 |last=MacRaild |first=Donald |publisher=Macmillan |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-312-22032-7 |location=London}}</ref>\u2014to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922 |last=Buckland |first=Patrick |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1973 |location=London |pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour|Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J.

P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break unionist ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see the link to what the Belfast labour leader [[William Walker (trade unionist)|William Walker]] represented to Connolly as a \"larger and more advanced democracy\u201d paying dividends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1911/connwalk/index.htm |title=The Connolly/Walker Controversy: On Socialist Unity in Ireland (1911) |last=The Cork Workers Club |website=marxists.org |language=en-GB |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> Thanks to the legislative union with Great Britain, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament.

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R.

With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . .

The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4, 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . .

Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923 |last=Laffan |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-139-10684-9}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy.

Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics |last=Mathews |first=Kevin |publisher=University College Dublin Press |year=2004 |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-904558-05-7 |pages=310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK) |Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964 |last=Lawrence |first=R.J.. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1965 |location=Oxford |pages=40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Dudley Edwards |first=Ruth |title=Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis |newspaper=The Times |date=29 May 2005 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first acts of Northern Ireland legislature was to scrap [[proportional representation]] (PR), prescribed for all Irish elections 1919. Preference voting was seen as having assisted nationalists to the control of a large number of local and district councils including, in a \"blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]],<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref> authorities which then pledged themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement (which had displaced Unionist councillors in Belfast) was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy |last=Kingsley |first=Paul |publisher=Belfast Publications |year=1989 |location=Belfast |isbn=0-9515549-0-5 |pages=19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref>{{cite web |title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/ |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London\u2014understood as a reward for the province's wartime service\u2014to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Northern Ireland |last=Buckland |first=Patrick |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |year=1981 |location=Dublin |isbn=978-0-7171-1069-8 |pages=83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title=Ulster at the Crossroads |last=O'Neill |first=Terence |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=1969 |location=London |pages=11}}</ref>\n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled.

Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism.\n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], a broad labour and republican grouping with [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland|Communist Party]] veteran [[Betty Sinclair]] as chair. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles |last1=Prince |first1=Simon |last2=Warner |first2=Geoffrey |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2019 |location=New Bridge, Ireland |isbn=978-1-78855-093-2 |pages=34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]].\n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/ |title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical |website=ianpaisley.org |language=en |access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed.\n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin |page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book |title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail |year=1997 |publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}}</ref>\n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society |location=Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and\u2014Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson.

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and those they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book |last=Northern Ireland Office |year=1972 |title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland |pages=140 |location=London |publisher= HMSO}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"\u2014that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first= Barry |year=1984 |title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles |location=Belfast |publisher= Blackstaff Press |isbn=978-0-85640-317-0 |pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\"<ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book |last=O'Malley |first= Padraig |year=1983 |title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today |pages=17, 26, 39 |location=Boston |publisher= Houghton Mifflin |isbn=039534414X}}</ref>\n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book |last=Devlin |first= Paddy |year=1993 |title=Straight Left: an Autobiography |location=Belfast |publisher= Blackstaff Press |isbn=0-85640-514-0 |pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref>\n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, Unionists feared these created the possibility of their being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted the SDLP had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\", but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late.<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref>\n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, Faulkner was forced to resign as UUP leader. A [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February was a triumph for the [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]], in which the bulk of his old party stood as \"Official Unionists\" with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Faulkner's pro-Assembly grouping was left with just 13% of the unionist vote. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections.\n\nWhen in May the Assembly affirmed the Sunningdale Agreement, a loyalist coalition, the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC) , called a general strike.

There were to be a number of consultative assemblies and forums in the years that followed, but the only elective offices with administrative responsibilities--and these were minimal--were in down-sized district councils. At Westminster unionist MPs contended with governments that remained committed to the principles of the 1972 Green Paper. A brief honeymoon with the Thatcher government ended with the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. The initiative in protesting what unionists often perceived as inadequate political and security responses to republican violence passed to loyalists. Their principal mode of operation was not to be the work stoppage. With Paisley's blessing, in 1977 the UDA and a number of other loyalists groups sought to replicate the UWC success.

A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, \"Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?\" is a meta-ethical question.\n\nMeta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. [[Meta-ethics]] is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].\n\nStudies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/</ref> Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.\n\nThe [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123\u2013155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}</ref>\n\n===Moral skepticism===\n{{Main|Moral skepticism}}\n\n'''Moral skepticism''' (or '''moral scepticism''') is a [[Class (philosophy)|class]] of  [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theories all members of which [[logical consequence|entail]] that no one has any moral [[knowledge]]. Many moral skeptics also make the stronger, [[Modal logic|modal]] claim that [[Moral nihilism|moral knowledge is impossible]]. Moral skepticism is particularly opposed to [[moral realism]]: the view that there are knowable and objective moral truths.\n\nSome proponents of moral skepticism include [[Pyrrho]], [[Aenesidemus]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[David Hume]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].\n\nMoral skepticism divides into three subclasses: moral error theory (or [[moral nihilism]]), epistemological moral skepticism, and [[Non-cognitivism|noncognitivism]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-moral/ Moral Skepticism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref> All three of these theories share the same conclusions, which are:\n\n:(a) we are never justified in believing that moral claims (claims of the form \"state of affairs x is good,\" \"action y is morally obligatory,\" etc.) are true and, even more so\n:(b) we never know that any moral claim is true.\n\nHowever, each method arrives at (a) and (b) by different routes.\n\nMoral error theory holds that we do not know that any moral claim is true because\n:(i) all moral claims are false,\n:(ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false, and\n:(iii) since we are not justified in believing any claim we have reason to deny, we are not justified in believing any moral claims.\n\nEpistemological moral skepticism is a subclass of theory, the members of which include [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] moral skepticism and dogmatic moral skepticism. All members of epistemological moral skepticism share two things: first, they acknowledge that we are unjustified in believing any moral claim, and second, they are [[agnostic]] on whether (i) is true (i.e. on whether all moral claims are false).\n*Pyrrhonian moral skepticism holds that the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim is that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral claim is true or that any moral claim is false. Thus, in addition to being agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).\n*Dogmatic moral skepticism, on the other hand, ''affirms'' (ii) and cites (ii)'s truth as the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim.\n\nNoncognitivism holds that we can never know that any moral claim is true because moral claims are ''incapable'' of being true or false (they are not [[truth-apt]]). Instead, moral claims are [[Universal prescriptivism|imperatives]] (e.g. \"Don't steal babies!\"), [[emotivism|expressions of emotion]] (e.g. \"stealing babies: Boo!\"), or [[expressivism|expressions of \"pro-attitudes\"]] (\"I do not believe that babies should be stolen.\")\n\n==Normative ethics==\n{{Main|Normative ethics}}\n[[Normative ethics|Normative]] ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.<ref name=bbc/> Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].\n\n===Virtue ethics===\n{{main|Virtue ethics}}\n[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]\n[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469\u2013399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\">{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ideasofgreatphil00will_0}}</ref>{{rp|32\u201333}}\n\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013323&nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed \"virtuous\". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.\n\nAristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot find any sources to corroborate this claim|date=July 2019}}: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.\n\n====Stoicism====\n{{main|Stoicism}}\n[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]\nThe [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The \"unconquerable will\" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not \"lose\" their life, but instead \"return\", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable.

Anscombe]]'s \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\". Anscombe argues that [[consequentialist]] and [[deontological]] ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in [[divine law]]. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to \"universal standards\", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.<ref name=\"Vries\">{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S.S.

At minimum, ethical intuitionism is the thesis that our [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive awareness]] of value, or intuitive knowledge of evaluative facts, forms the foundation of our ethical knowledge.\n\nThe view is at its core a [[foundationalism]] about moral knowledge: it is the view that some moral truths can be known non-inferentially (i.e., known without one needing to infer them from other truths one believes).  Such an epistemological view implies that there are moral beliefs with propositional contents; so it implies [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]]. As such, ethical intuitionism is to be contrasted with [[coherentism|coherentist]] approaches to moral epistemology, such as those that depend on [[reflective equilibrium]].<ref name=\"Shafer-Landau & Cuneo foundationalism\">Shafer-Landau & Cuneo (2012), p. 385</ref>\n\nThroughout the philosophical literature, the term \"ethical intuitionism\" is frequently used with significant variation in its sense. This article's focus on foundationalism reflects the core commitments of contemporary self-identified ethical intuitionists.<ref name=\"Shafer-Landau & Cuneo foundationalism\" /><ref name=\"SEP\">Stratton-Lake (2014) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism-ethics/</ref>\n\nSufficiently broadly defined, ethical intuitionism can be taken to encompass cognitivist forms of [[moral sense theory]].<ref name=\"Stratton-Lake sentimentalism\">Stratton-Lake (2013), p. 337</ref> It is usually furthermore taken as essential to ethical intuitionism that there be [[self-evidence|self-evident]] or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' moral knowledge; this counts against considering moral sense theory to be a species of intuitionism. (see the [[Ethical intuitionism#Rational intuition versus moral sense|Rational intuition versus moral sense]] section of this article for further discussion).\n\nEthical intuitionism was first clearly shown in use by the philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. Later ethical intuitionists of influence and note include  [[Henry Sidgwick]],  [[G.E. Moore]], [[Harold Arthur Prichard]], [[C.S. Lewis]] and, most influentially, [[Robert Audi]].\n\nObjections to ethical intuitionism include whether or not there are objective moral values- an assumption which the ethical system is based upon- the question of why many disagree over ethics if they are absolute, and whether [[Occam's razor]] cancels such a theory out entirely.\n\n===Hedonism===\n{{Main|Hedonism}}\n[[Hedonism]] posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [[pleasure]] and minimizing [[suffering|pain]]. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Cyrenaic hedonism====\nFounded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. \"Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\" Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Epicureanism====\n{{Main|Epicureanism}}\nEpicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] \"...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue.\"<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref> He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\n===State consequentialism===\n{{Main|State consequentialism}}\n[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,<ref name=\"readings\">{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}</ref> is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.<ref name=readings/> The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as \"a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\".<ref>Fraser, Chris, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]\", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N.

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''\"The ends justify the means\"''.\n\nThe term \"consequentialism\" was coined by [[G.E.M. Anscombe]] in her essay \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].<ref name=\"Anscombe\">{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M.

Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:\n* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?\n* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?\n* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?\n\nOne way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.\n\n====Utilitarianism====\n{{Main|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]\n[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]\nUtilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as \"happiness\", \"welfare\", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.<ref name=\"Mill\">{{cite book|title= Utilitarianism|year=1998|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn =978-0-19-875163-2|url= http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}</ref> Other noteworthy proponents of utilitarianism are neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], author of ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], author of, amongst other works, ''[[Practical Ethics]]''.\n\nThe major division within utilitarianism is between ''[[act utilitarianism]]'' and ''[[rule utilitarianism]]''. In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.<ref name=\"Carnegie Mellon University\">{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> A proposed \"middle ground\" between these two types is [[Two-level utilitarianism]], where rules are applied in ordinary circumstances, but with an allowance to choose actions outside of such rules when unusual situations call for it.\n\n===Deontology===\n<!-- Section linked from \"Categorical imperative\" -->\n{{Main|Deontological ethics}}\n\nDeontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''deon'', \"obligation, duty\"; and {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]</ref>  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself.

'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].</ref> Something is \"good in itself\" when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and \"good without qualification\", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]] and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:\n{{quote|Nothing in the world\u2014indeed nothing even beyond the world\u2014can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.<ref name=\"transition\"/>}}Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'.<ref name=\"transition\" /> People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way ''because'' they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of \"respect\" for the law. He defines respect as \"the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals|url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalprinc05682gut|year=1785|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=23|edition=10|editor=Thomas Kingsmill Abbott}}</ref>\n\nKant's three significant formulations of the [[categorical imperative]] are:\n* Act only according to that [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] by which you can also will that it would become a universal law.\n* Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.\n* Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.\n\nKant argued that the only [[moral absolutism|absolutely good]] thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. \"I will lie\", then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.\nIn his essay, ''On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns'', arguing against the position of \n[[Benjamin Constant]], ''Des r\u00e9actions politiques'', Kant states that \"Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (''mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius''). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [''Rechtsquelle''] ... All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth ... This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles.\"<ref>\"\u00dcber ein vermeintes Recht aus Menschenliebe zu l\u00fcgen\", ''Berlinische Bl\u00e4tter'' 1 (1797), 301-314; edited in: ''Werke in zw\u00f6lf B\u00e4nden'', vol. 8, Frankfurt am Main (1977), [http://www.zeno.org/nid/20009192123 zeno.org/nid/20009192123].</ref>\n\n====Divine command theory====\n{{Main|Divine command theory}}\nAlthough not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the 'divine command theory', which is actually a cluster of related theories which essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right.<ref>Wierenga, Edward. 1983. \"A Defensible Divine Command Theory\". ''No\u00fbs'', Vol. 17, No. 3: 387\u2013407.</ref>  According to [[Ralph Cudworth]], an English philosopher, [[William of Ockham]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and eighteenth-century [[Calvinists]] all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands.<ref>Cudworth, Ralph. 1731. ''A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality''. Reprinted in 1996. Sarah Hutton (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> The Divine Command Theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath ''because God has commanded that they do not do so''. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking \"right\", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.\n\nOne thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.\n\n====Discourse ethics====\n[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Jurgen Habermas, whose theory of discourse ethics was influenced by Kantian ethics]]\n{{Main|Discourse ethics}}\nGerman philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] has proposed a theory of [[discourse ethics]] that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics.<ref>Payrow Shabani 2003, p. 53</ref> He proposes that action should be based on communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached.<ref>Collin 2007, p. 78</ref> Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitive]] ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.<ref name=Shabani>Payrow Shabani 2003, p. 54</ref>\n\nHabermas argues that his ethical theory is an improvement on Kant's ethics.<ref name=Shabani/> He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] world, which can be sensed and experienced by humans, and the [[Noumenon|noumena]], or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.<ref>Payrow Shabani 2003, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\n===Pragmatic ethics===\n{{Main|Pragmatic ethics}}\nAssociated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes.

This was on the basis that personal identity was, in the most part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that \"there is no outside-text/non-text\" (\"''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''\" is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside the text\"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.\n\nPost-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.\n\n[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.\n\nDavid Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the \"ethical turn\" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the \"obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable\" (2004, p.&nbsp;103).\n\nHoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as \"not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless\"(2004, p.&nbsp;8).\n\nHoy concludes that\n{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}\n\n==Applied ethics==\n{{Main|Applied ethics}}\nApplied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].\n\n===Specific questions===\nApplied ethics is used in some aspects of determining [[public policy]], as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: [[Abortion debate|\u201cIs getting an abortion immoral?\u201d]]; \"Is [[euthanasia]] immoral?\"; \"Is [[affirmative action]] right or wrong?\"; \"What are [[human rights]], and how do we determine them?\"; \"Do [[Animal rights|animals have rights]] as well?\"; and \"Do individuals have [[Self-determination|the right of self-determination]]?\"<ref name=bbc/>\n\nA more specific question could be: \"If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?\" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration\u2014in fact, no common assumptions of all participants\u2014so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, \"Is lying always wrong?\" and, \"If not, when is it permissible?\" is prior to any etiquette.\n\nPeople, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a \"yes or no\" or a \u201cright or wrong\" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.\n\nAnd it has not only been shown that people consider the character of the moral agent (i.e. a principle implied in virtue ethics), the deed of the action (i.e. a principle implied in [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]), and the consequences of the action (i.e. a principle implied in utilitarianism) when formulating moral judgments, but moreover that the effect of each of these three components depends on the value of each component.<ref name=\"Moral judgment\">{{cite journal|last=Dublkevic, Sattler, Racine |title= Deciphering moral intuition: How agents, deeds, and consequences influence moral judgment|journal=[[PLOS One]]|volume=13|issue=10|pages= e0206750|year=2018|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0204631|pmid= 30273370|bibcode= 2018PLoSO..1304631D|pmc=6166963}}</ref>\n\n===Particular fields of application===\n====Bioethics====\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\n{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}\nBioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]].

It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|\"the ethics of the ordinary\"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.\n\nBioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans.

Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.\n\nBusiness ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"<ref>Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.</ref> Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.<ref>Berle, A.A., & Means, G.C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, \"Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'\u2014as there once was a feudal system\u2014which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith.

This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.\n\n====Military ethics====\n{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}\n\nMilitary ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.<ref>{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}</ref> [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics.

Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical\u2014such as, \"Is ethical knowledge possible?\"\u2014are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:\n* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics\u2014and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.\n* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] (\"Miss Manners\"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.\n* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing \"right versus right\", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.\n* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing.

A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, \"Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?\" is a meta-ethical question.\n\nMeta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and [[acculturation]] in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. [[Meta-ethics]] is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].\n\nStudies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is quite akin to the thing called descriptive and non-descriptive. Non-cognitivism is the view that when we judge something as morally right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may, for example, be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/</ref> Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.\n\nThe [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific [[ontology]] since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists, on the other hand, must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = The Conditions of Moral Realism | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophical Research | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123\u2013155 | doi=10.5840/jpr_2009_5}}</ref>\n\n===Moral skepticism===\n{{Main|Moral skepticism}}\n\n'''Moral skepticism''' (or '''moral scepticism''') is a [[Class (philosophy)|class]] of  [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theories all members of which [[logical consequence|entail]] that no one has any moral [[knowledge]]. Many moral skeptics also make the stronger, [[Modal logic|modal]] claim that [[Moral nihilism|moral knowledge is impossible]]. Moral skepticism is particularly opposed to [[moral realism]]: the view that there are knowable and objective moral truths.\n\nSome proponents of moral skepticism include [[Pyrrho]], [[Aenesidemus]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[David Hume]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].\n\nMoral skepticism divides into three subclasses: moral error theory (or [[moral nihilism]]), epistemological moral skepticism, and [[Non-cognitivism|noncognitivism]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-moral/ Moral Skepticism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref> All three of these theories share the same conclusions, which are:\n\n:(a) we are never justified in believing that moral claims (claims of the form \"state of affairs x is good,\" \"action y is morally obligatory,\" etc.) are true and, even more so\n:(b) we never know that any moral claim is true.\n\nHowever, each method arrives at (a) and (b) by different routes.\n\nMoral error theory holds that we do not know that any moral claim is true because\n:(i) all moral claims are false,\n:(ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false, and\n:(iii) since we are not justified in believing any claim we have reason to deny, we are not justified in believing any moral claims.\n\nEpistemological moral skepticism is a subclass of theory, the members of which include [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] moral skepticism and dogmatic moral skepticism. All members of epistemological moral skepticism share two things: first, they acknowledge that we are unjustified in believing any moral claim, and second, they are [[agnostic]] on whether (i) is true (i.e. on whether all moral claims are false).\n*Pyrrhonian moral skepticism holds that the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim is that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral claim is true or that any moral claim is false. Thus, in addition to being agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).\n*Dogmatic moral skepticism, on the other hand, ''affirms'' (ii) and cites (ii)'s truth as the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim.\n\nNoncognitivism holds that we can never know that any moral claim is true because moral claims are ''incapable'' of being true or false (they are not [[truth-apt]]). Instead, moral claims are [[Universal prescriptivism|imperatives]] (e.g. \"Don't steal babies!\"), [[emotivism|expressions of emotion]] (e.g. \"stealing babies: Boo!\"), or [[expressivism|expressions of \"pro-attitudes\"]] (\"I do not believe that babies should be stolen.\")\n\n==Normative ethics==\n{{Main|Normative ethics}}\n[[Normative ethics|Normative]] ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.<ref name=bbc/> Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an [[empirical]] investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavalier |first=Robert |title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics |work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and were no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but were interested in many different kinds of moral status. During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].\n\n===Virtue ethics===\n{{main|Virtue ethics}}\n[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]]]]\n[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and it is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469\u2013399 BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge was secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the results of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his or her actions, he or she would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\">{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ideasofgreatphil00will_0}}</ref>{{rp|32\u201333}}\n\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013323&nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed \"virtuous\". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with virtue this person will do good and be content. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by doing wrong, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with virtue, which is only attainable by the practice of the virtues in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], were only made worthwhile and of benefit when employed in the practice of the virtues. The practice of the virtues is the surest path to happiness.\n\nAristotle asserted that the soul of man had three natures{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot find any sources to corroborate this claim|date=July 2019}}: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite), and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care; emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges; and mental nature through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason.\n\n====Stoicism====\n{{main|Stoicism}}\n[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Epictetus]]]]\nThe [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or ''[[apatheia]]'', was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The \"unconquerable will\" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is, in essence, offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to the existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not \"lose\" their life, but instead \"return\", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the [[integrity]] and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\n====Contemporary virtue ethics====\nModern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G.E.M. Anscombe]]'s \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\". Anscombe argues that [[consequentialist]] and [[deontological]] ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in [[divine law]]. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to \"universal standards\", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.<ref name=\"Vries\">{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S.S.

In ''Whose Justice, Whose Rationality?'', MacIntyre's ambition of taking a rational path beyond relativism was quite clear when he stated \"rival claims made by different traditions [\u2026] are to be evaluated [\u2026] without relativism\" (p.&nbsp;354) because indeed \"rational debate between and rational choice among rival traditions is possible\u201d (p.&nbsp;352).

At minimum, ethical intuitionism is the thesis that our [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive awareness]] of value, or intuitive knowledge of evaluative facts, forms the foundation of our ethical knowledge.\n\nThe view is at its core a [[foundationalism]] about moral knowledge: it is the view that some moral truths can be known non-inferentially (i.e., known without one needing to infer them from other truths one believes).  Such an epistemological view implies that there are moral beliefs with propositional contents; so it implies [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]]. As such, ethical intuitionism is to be contrasted with [[coherentism|coherentist]] approaches to moral epistemology, such as those that depend on [[reflective equilibrium]].<ref name=\"Shafer-Landau & Cuneo foundationalism\">Shafer-Landau & Cuneo (2012), p. 385</ref>\n\nThroughout the philosophical literature, the term \"ethical intuitionism\" is frequently used with significant variation in its sense. This article's focus on foundationalism reflects the core commitments of contemporary self-identified ethical intuitionists.<ref name=\"Shafer-Landau & Cuneo foundationalism\" /><ref name=\"SEP\">Stratton-Lake (2014) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism-ethics/</ref>\n\nSufficiently broadly defined, ethical intuitionism can be taken to encompass cognitivist forms of [[moral sense theory]].<ref name=\"Stratton-Lake sentimentalism\">Stratton-Lake (2013), p. 337</ref> It is usually furthermore taken as essential to ethical intuitionism that there be [[self-evidence|self-evident]] or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' moral knowledge; this counts against considering moral sense theory to be a species of intuitionism. (see the [[Ethical intuitionism#Rational intuition versus moral sense|Rational intuition versus moral sense]] section of this article for further discussion).\n\nEthical intuitionism was first clearly shown in use by the philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. Later ethical intuitionists of influence and note include  [[Henry Sidgwick]],  [[G.E. Moore]], [[Harold Arthur Prichard]], [[C.S. Lewis]] and, most influentially, [[Robert Audi]].\n\nObjections to ethical intuitionism include whether or not there are objective moral values- an assumption which the ethical system is based upon- the question of why many disagree over ethics if they are absolute, and whether [[Occam's razor]] cancels such a theory out entirely.\n\n===Hedonism===\n{{Main|Hedonism}}\n[[Hedonism]] posits that the principal ethic is maximizing [[pleasure]] and minimizing [[suffering|pain]]. There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Cyrenaic hedonism====\nFounded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. \"Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\" Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit of immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Epicureanism====\n{{Main|Epicureanism}}\nEpicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] \"...presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue.\"<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref> He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus, the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often makes a person lose a taste for it. Eating too much food at once leads to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there were an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state of death in the absence of an afterlife.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\n===State consequentialism===\n{{Main|State consequentialism}}\n[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,<ref name=\"readings\">{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}</ref> is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.<ref name=readings/> The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as \"a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\".<ref>Fraser, Chris, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]\", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N.

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''\"The ends justify the means\"''.\n\nThe term \"consequentialism\" was coined by [[G.E.M. Anscombe]] in her essay \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].<ref name=\"Anscombe\">{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M.

Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:\n* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?\n* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?\n* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?\n\nOne way to divide various consequentialisms is by the many types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase and positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.\n\n====Utilitarianism====\n{{Main|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham]]\n[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|John Stuart Mill]]\nUtilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as \"happiness\", \"welfare\", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

This form of utilitarianism holds that the morally correct action is the one that produces the best outcome for all people affected by the action.

In act utilitarianism, the principle of utility applies directly to each alternative act in a situation of choice. The right act is the one that brings about the best results (or the least amount of bad results). In rule utilitarianism, the principle of utility determines the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people break promises at will and a world in which promises are binding. Right and wrong are the following or breaking of rules that are sanctioned by their utilitarian value.<ref name=\"Carnegie Mellon University\">{{cite web |url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html |work=Department of Philosophy, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] |title=Utilitarian Theories |year=1996 |access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> A proposed \"middle ground\" between these two types is [[Two-level utilitarianism]], where rules are applied in ordinary circumstances, but with an allowance to choose actions outside of such rules when unusual situations call for it.\n\n===Deontology===\n<!-- Section linked from \"Categorical imperative\" -->\n{{Main|Deontological ethics}}\n\nDeontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''deon'', \"obligation, duty\"; and {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]</ref>  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself.

'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].</ref> Something is \"good in itself\" when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and \"good without qualification\", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]] and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:\n{{quote|Nothing in the world\u2014indeed nothing even beyond the world\u2014can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.<ref name=\"transition\"/>}}Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'.<ref name=\"transition\" /> People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way ''because'' they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of \"respect\" for the law. He defines respect as \"the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals|url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalprinc05682gut|year=1785|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=23|edition=10|editor=Thomas Kingsmill Abbott}}</ref>\n\nKant's three significant formulations of the [[categorical imperative]] are:\n* Act only according to that [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] by which you can also will that it would become a universal law.\n* Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.\n* Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.\n\nKant argued that the only [[moral absolutism|absolutely good]] thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. \"I will lie\", then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.\nIn his essay, ''On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns'', arguing against the position of \n[[Benjamin Constant]], ''Des r\u00e9actions politiques'', Kant states that \"Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (''mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius''). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [''Rechtsquelle''] ... All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth ... This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles.\"<ref>\"\u00dcber ein vermeintes Recht aus Menschenliebe zu l\u00fcgen\", ''Berlinische Bl\u00e4tter'' 1 (1797), 301-314; edited in: ''Werke in zw\u00f6lf B\u00e4nden'', vol. 8, Frankfurt am Main (1977), [http://www.zeno.org/nid/20009192123 zeno.org/nid/20009192123].</ref>\n\n====Divine command theory====\n{{Main|Divine command theory}}\nAlthough not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the 'divine command theory', which is actually a cluster of related theories which essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right.<ref>Wierenga, Edward. 1983. \"A Defensible Divine Command Theory\". ''No\u00fbs'', Vol. 17, No. 3: 387\u2013407.</ref>  According to [[Ralph Cudworth]], an English philosopher, [[William of Ockham]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and eighteenth-century [[Calvinists]] all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands.<ref>Cudworth, Ralph. 1731. ''A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality''. Reprinted in 1996. Sarah Hutton (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> The Divine Command Theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath ''because God has commanded that they do not do so''. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking \"right\", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.\n\nOne thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.\n\n====Discourse ethics====\n[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Jurgen Habermas, whose theory of discourse ethics was influenced by Kantian ethics]]\n{{Main|Discourse ethics}}\nGerman philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] has proposed a theory of [[discourse ethics]] that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics.<ref>Payrow Shabani 2003, p. 53</ref> He proposes that action should be based on communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached.<ref>Collin 2007, p. 78</ref> Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitive]] ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.<ref name=Shabani>Payrow Shabani 2003, p. 54</ref>\n\nHabermas argues that his ethical theory is an improvement on Kant's ethics.<ref name=Shabani/> He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] world, which can be sensed and experienced by humans, and the [[Noumenon|noumena]], or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.<ref>Payrow Shabani 2003, pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\n===Pragmatic ethics===\n{{Main|Pragmatic ethics}}\nAssociated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes.

The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist, and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]].\n\nStarting from the premise that the goal of ethical philosophy should be to help humans adapt and thrive in evolutionary terms, Kropotkin's ethical framework uses biology and anthropology as a basis \u2013 in order to scientifically establish what will best enable a given social order to thrive biologically and socially \u2013 and advocates certain behavioural practices to enhance humanity's capacity for freedom and well-being, namely practices which emphasise solidarity, equality, and justice.\n\nKropotkin argues that ethics itself is evolutionary, and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through cultural history, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of morality. The origin of ethical feeling in both animals and humans can be found, he claims, in the natural fact of \"sociality\" (mutualistic symbiosis), which humans can then combine with the instinct for justice (i.e. equality) and then with the practice of reason to construct a non-supernatural and anarchistic system of ethics.<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf \"Ethics: Origin and Development\" by P\u00ebtr Kropotkin]</ref> Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality at the core of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: <blockquote>This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.<ref>[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html \"Anarchist morality\", chapter VI, P\u00ebtr Kropotkin]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Postmodern ethics===\n{{Main|Postmodernism}}\n{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}\nThe 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.\n\n[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself. This was on the basis that personal identity was, in the most part, a social construction. As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that \"there is no outside-text/non-text\" (\"''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''\" is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside the text\"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.\n\nPost-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individual actions.\n\n[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[postmodernity]] is best described as modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.\n\nDavid Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the \"ethical turn\" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the \"obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable\" (2004, p.&nbsp;103).\n\nHoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as \"not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless\"(2004, p.&nbsp;8).\n\nHoy concludes that\n{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p. 184)}}\n\n==Applied ethics==\n{{Main|Applied ethics}}\nApplied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].\n\n===Specific questions===\nApplied ethics is used in some aspects of determining [[public policy]], as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: [[Abortion debate|\u201cIs getting an abortion immoral?\u201d]]; \"Is [[euthanasia]] immoral?\"; \"Is [[affirmative action]] right or wrong?\"; \"What are [[human rights]], and how do we determine them?\"; \"Do [[Animal rights|animals have rights]] as well?\"; and \"Do individuals have [[Self-determination|the right of self-determination]]?\"<ref name=bbc/>\n\nA more specific question could be: \"If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?\" Without these questions, there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration\u2014in fact, no common assumptions of all participants\u2014so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, \"Is lying always wrong?\" and, \"If not, when is it permissible?\" is prior to any etiquette.\n\nPeople, in general, are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics, the issues are most often multifaceted and the best-proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions, the answer is almost never a \"yes or no\" or a \u201cright or wrong\" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.\n\nAnd it has not only been shown that people consider the character of the moral agent (i.e. a principle implied in virtue ethics), the deed of the action (i.e. a principle implied in [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]), and the consequences of the action (i.e. a principle implied in utilitarianism) when formulating moral judgments, but moreover that the effect of each of these three components depends on the value of each component.<ref name=\"Moral judgment\">{{cite journal|last=Dublkevic, Sattler, Racine |title= Deciphering moral intuition: How agents, deeds, and consequences influence moral judgment|journal=[[PLOS One]]|volume=13|issue=10|pages= e0206750|year=2018|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0204631|pmid= 30273370|bibcode= 2018PLoSO..1304631D|pmc=6166963}}</ref>\n\n===Particular fields of application===\n====Bioethics====\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\n{{See also|Islamic bioethics|Jewish medical ethics}}\nBioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|\"the ethics of the ordinary\"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.\n\nBioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics |accessdate=December 21, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins, e.g. \"three parent baby, where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.F.|last2= Kitney|first2=R.I.|year=2012|title=Synthetic Biology|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location =New Jersey|isbn=978-1-84816-862-6}}</ref> Correspondingly, new bioethics also need to address life at its core.

Business ethics represents the practices that any individual or group exhibits within an organization that can negatively or positively affect the businesses core values. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.\n\nBusiness ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflect the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"<ref>Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.</ref> Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.<ref>Berle, A.A., & Means, G.C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, \"Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'\u2014as there once was a feudal system\u2014which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&nbsp;...

For example, machines, unlike humans, can support a wide selection of [[List of machine learning algorithms|learning algorithms]], and controversy has arisen over the relative ethical merits of these options. This may reopen classic debates of normative ethics framed in new (highly technical) terms.\n\n====Military ethics====\n{{See also|Geneva Conventions|Nuremberg Principles}}\n\nMilitary ethics are concerned with questions regarding the application of force and the ethos of the soldier and are often understood as applied professional ethics.<ref>{{cite news |last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|last1=Cook|first1=Martin L.|title=What Should We Mean by 'Military Ethics'?|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=9|issue=2|year=2010|page=122}}</ref> [[Just war theory]] is generally seen to set the background terms of military ethics.

Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical\u2014such as, \"Is ethical knowledge possible?\"\u2014are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:\n* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics\u2014and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.\n* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] (\"Miss Manners\"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.\n* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing \"right versus right\", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.\n* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing.
