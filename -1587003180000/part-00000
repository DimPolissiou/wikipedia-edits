Built for the [[Baron Foley|Foleys]] in the seventeenth century on the site of a former manor house, it was enormously expanded in the early nineteenth century by the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] for [[Thomas Foley, 3rd Baron Foley]].  The estate was later sold to the [[Earl of Dudley|Earls of Dudley]], who undertook a second massive reconstruction in the mid-19th century, employing the architect [[Samuel Daukes]] to create one of the great palaces of Victorian and Edwardian England.\n\nThe declining fortune of the Dudleys saw the sale of the court after the [[First World War]] to a [[Kidderminster]] carpet manufacturer.  In 1937 a major fire caused great damage to the court, the estate was broken up and sold and the house was subsequently stripped of its fittings and furnishings. Forty years of decay followed before the house and grounds were taken into the care of [[Historic England|The Department of the Environment]] in 1972.

It was located in the heart of [[Perth]] on the corner of [[Victoria Avenue, Perth|Victoria Avenue]] and [[St Georges Terrace]].\n\nIn 1938, the boarding school and some day boys moved to the new school at [[Aquinas College, Perth|Aquinas College]], Salter Point. Aquinas inherited the school colours red and black, the school crest and motto, the honour boards, and the school PSA membership and achievements. The new campus at Aquinas depleted student numbers at CBC Perth. Nearby, St Patrick's, a Christian Brothers school in the city on the corner of Wellington and Lord Streets, was overflowing. Many students transferred from St Patrick's, and CBC Perth continued as a day school from 1938. Stripped of its history, traditions and students, CBC Perth raised new honour boards and the colours blue, light blue and green, and the college set about claiming a new heritage which 24 years later would become Trinity College.\n\nWhen Perth won the right to host the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]], the [[City of Perth]] negotiated with the Christian Brothers from 1958-1960 to purchase CBC Perth for \u00a3267,000, in order to widen St Georges Terrace and to construct a new hotel.<ref name=History/> The Chevron-Hilton Hotel Group which had committed to the development, ran into difficulties, and the school buildings remained until demolition in the mid-1960s. The site was vacant until the [[Australian Taxation Office]] building was built there several years later. The building is now the Duxton Hotel. The council provided a {{convert|5.7|ha|acre|0|sing=on}} site for the new college on reclaimed land in [[East Perth, Western Australia|East Perth]] on the banks of the Swan River, next to the [[WACA Ground]], [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]], and [[The Causeway]].<ref name=History/>\n\nBrother J.A.Kelly, headmaster of CBC Perth, and architect Jim Henderson fast tracked construction of Trinity College from 1960 to ensure the college opened in time for the 1962 school year. Even with the pressing deadline, Brother Kelly was instrumental in building the imaginative round chapel at Trinity, and he commissioned Ted Gowers to design the stained glass windows set in concrete.<ref name=TCNews>Trinity News Summer 2012, General - Vale to a Man of Glass p21, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref> At the time, this was the largest work of art undertaken in the post-war years of Western Australia.<ref name=TCNews/> Brother Kelly also commissioned artist Margaret Priest to design and make abstract statues of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], the [[Crucifix]], and the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]].<ref>Trinity News Summer 2012, Archives - The Trinity College Madonna and Child Statue p37, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1961, Trinity College was nearing completion. CBC Perth closed and when St Patrick's closed two years later the two schools became one.<ref>Trinity News Summer 2013, Archives - St Patrick's Celtic Cross p38, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 25 December 2013</ref>\n\n==Trinity==\nIn 1962, Trinity opened as a day school with 830 boys. The official opening was held on 25 March 1962.<ref name=History/> The school had a new crest and motto, and retained the colours and the honour boards of CBC Perth which were raised in 1938. Trinity dominated Association Catholic Colleges sporting events. In 1968, Trinity joined the [[Public Schools Association|PSA]] and the manful rivalry with Aquinas, ''the old foe'', entered a level playing field. In 1972, Trinity won the PSA athletics carnival ending a seven-year winning streak by Aquinas. In the years ahead, coaches and students at Aquinas responded with the call, \"Beat Trinity!\"\n\n===Campus===\nThe college has undergone significant expansion. The original 1962 buildings included Trinity Chapel, A and B blocks, Gibney Hall, the pavilion, a squash and handball court (both demolished late 1999), and the Brothers Monastery (rebuilt into the Junior School in 1991). In 1983, Gibney Hall was widened, by bricking-in the balcony on the western side, and lengthened to accommodate all students and staff at assemblies. Over the years the college has expanded to include Kelly Senior School 1968, Duffy Library 1979, admin block 1981, Foley Physical Education Centre 1992, Treacy Design and Technology Centre 2001, Brockwell Observatory 2001, Curtis Aquatic Centre 2004, and O'Doherty Cultural Education Centre 2010.  In addition to the East Perth campus, the school has Camp Kelly, an outdoor education facility situated 8&nbsp;km south of Dwellingup, and {{convert|10|ha|m2}} of sports ground at Waterford.\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College - View from the Oval.tif|1024px|View from the oval||none}}\n\n===Principals===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brother JA Kelly, Headmaster Trinity College Perth 1962.tif|60px|thumb|left|Br Kelly, 1962]] -->\n\nBrother Kelly was the last headmaster of CBC Perth and the founding headmaster of Trinity College.

It is compulsory for each student to compete in a summer and a winter sport. PSA sports take precedence over sports outside the college. Other than for health reasons, a student may only be exempted from training, matches, or both if the student is selected to train or play at a national or international level when it clashes with college training or PSA competition. The college does not encourage students to try out for higher representative levels if it conflicts with the college PSA sporting schedule. In football, Trinity students typically do not compete for selection for the [[Western Australian Football League]] colts or for Teal Cup teams. This does not hamper future selection opportunities for students. Many students have been selected in the [[Australian Football League]] national draft based on their performance in the PSA. The sporting skills, coaching, fitness and organisation of students from the seven PSA schools is commensurable to the highest levels offered by any schoolboy competition in Western Australia. This is evident by the number of former PSA students who compete in their chosen sports at state, national, international, and Olympic levels.\n\nAs the most recent school in the PSA, Trinity has improved over time and the college has moved up the ranks in most sports. The most notable exception is swimming.\n\nThe main campus at East Perth has one oval which prior to the EPRA land-swap catered for a turf cricket ground in summer, a football oval in winter, and an athletics training track in spring. There are four outdoor [[hardcourts]] marked for tennis and basketball. The campus has a 50m swimming pool and a gymnasium which is marked with basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts. As well, the school has a rowing boathouse on the East Perth foreshore. Courses along [[Heirisson Island]], the Swan River foreshore, and [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] including [[Kings Park, Western Australia#Jacob's Ladder|Jacobs Ladder]] provide excellent cross-country tracks. The East Perth campus lacks dedicated facilities for hockey, rugby and soccer. At various times the college has sought to purchase the land between the college and the Causeway, as well as vacant land on the north side of Gloucester Park. Negotiations for these purchases with the City of Perth have repeatedly fallen through due to town planning intentions. However, the City of Perth has allowed the college to use facilities at Haig Park, which has now been redeveloped by EPRA, and to use facilities at [[Langley Park (Western Australia)|Langley Park]] and [[Wellington Square, Perth|Wellington Square]].\n\nThe Waterford playing fields have five cricket ovals, three turfed and two synthetic pitches. Two turfed pitch ovals become football ovals in winter and the remaining pitches separate into two soccer fields, two hockey fields and one rugby field.\n\nThe senior school holds official college trials and championships for swimming and athletics. Students who advance from the trials compete against each other in the college championships to decide school champions and to decide who qualifies for events on the school teams. Summer and winter team sports hold similar selection procedures relevant to the criteria set-down by each code. College champions for summer and winter team sports are chosen by judging committees who award points for a player's performance for each official PSA fixture. In addition, the college has three major sports awards. The J P Ilich Award for outstanding service to the school in sport, and the Old Boys Awards for the students who score the most points for Trinity at PSA athletics and swimming carnivals.\n\n===School houses===\nTrinity inherited a four [[house system]] from CBC Perth. Each house has a major and a minor colour, a motto and an emblem. Each classroom stream is divided into one of the four houses. Siblings and cousins belong to the house of their eldest relative. When played, competitions are held to decide the House Champion. Currently, the house system is the format for carnival competitions held within the junior school.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Two carnivals, swimming and athletics, are called the Bowers, and the third carnival, cross-country, is called the Sevens. Teams are the same as the home-room class. In the lead up to the swimming and athletics carnivals, each home-room class holds an impromptu meeting to decide the Jack (class captain) and the Dealer (class selector). The tactics of the Dealer are the key to winning a Bowers carnival. Each student must compete in one of the race divisions for each event and the line-ups must be submitted before a Bowers carnival begins. Each race division awards the same points descending from first to last. Calculations using intelligence gathering and misinformation are required to work out the best order to race classmates. One important play is the Jack who is awarded maximum points regardless of where he finishes in a race. Cheating is a permitted tactic. A cheat stands and points awarded if no appeal is made to the carnival judge before the end of a race. If an appeal for cheating is upheld, the cheater forfeits points earned from the race. The winning team is the class which out-trumps the other classes by setting up the most favourable mis-matches in order to score the most points. The cross-country carnival, called the Sevens, is pure in format. No cheats are permitted and the carnival judge may order a cheater to wear a smock-of-shame for a day. The winning team is the first to have seven classmates cross the finishing line. However, there is one important exception. The team with the last seven to cross the finishing line automatically loses. The carnivals may be used for fundraising and nominal wagers by each competitor are put into a kitty. The winning team for each carnival is awarded the right to choose an approved cause to donate the kitty.\n\n===School hymn===\nThe title of the school hymn, \"[[In nomine Domini|In Nomine Domini]]\", is derived from the school motto and [[Psalm]] 123: ''adjutorium nostrum in Nomine Domini,'' \"Our help is in the name of the Lord.\" The hymn was written in 1979 by Father Paul Keyte, the school chaplain at the time. Inspired by the Harrow School Song \"Forty Years On\", Father Keyte wrote in the 1979 School Annual, he was not merely trying to write a hymn but an anthem and something that, \"would not only renew loyalty to the school but would also rekindle the flame of faith\". The music was written by Brother Gerald Crooks, a long serving music teacher at the College. In 1984, Brother Crooks introduced a brass fanfare lead featuring trumpets and trombones. \"In Nomine Domine\" is sung at Speech Nights, Year 12 Graduations, [[ANZAC Day]] ceremonies, and at PSA sporting events.\n\n==International achievements==\n'''International Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2016'''\n\nThe team from Trinity won the Meritous Award - the second highest award category - at the [[International Mathematical Modeling Challenge|International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IM<sup>2</sup>C)]].

boys, located on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] foreshore in [[East Perth, Western Australia]]. The school was established in 1962 when students from the city schools [[Christian Brothers College, Perth|CBC Perth]] and [[St Patrick's Boy School, Perth|St Patrick's Boys School]] moved to the new Trinity College campus.<ref name=History /><ref>{{cite web\n    |url = http://www.accsport.asn.au/detailed-history/abridged-history\n    |title = Abridged History, Associated & Catholic Colleges (see St Patrick's School, a founding member)\n    |accessdate = 4 October 2012\n    |format = Website|publisher = Association of Catholic Colleges}}</ref>\n\nTrinity College is commonly shortened to '''Trinity''' or '''TC'''. Former students of Trinity are called Trinity Old Boys. Trinity is a school in the [[Edmund Ignatius Rice|Edmund Rice]] tradition promoting classic and modern education, culture, dance, drama, music, service to others, spirituality, sport, and vocation.<ref name=AISWA>{{cite web\n    |url = http://www.ais.wa.edu.au/search-school/?&mode=details&id=111\n    |title = Trinity College\n    |accessdate = 26 December 2007\n    |work = Search for School\n    |publisher = Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia}}</ref> Trinity comprises an East Perth campus with a junior school for years 4 to 6, a middle school for years 7 to 8, and a senior school for years 9 to 12; an outdoor education wilderness at Camp Kelly [[Dwellingup, Western Australia|Dwellingup]]; and sporting grounds at [[Waterford, Western Australia|Waterford]].\n\n==CBC Perth and St Patrick's Boys School==\n[[File:CBC Perth, St Georges Tce - (improved contrast).tif|237px|thumb|right|CBC Perth, St Georges Tce, Est.1894]]\n[[File:Trinity College Perth - Main Gates (improved contrast cropped).tif|237px|thumb|right|Trinity College Perth, Centenary Gates]]\n\nCBC Perth was founded in 1894 by Bishop [[Matthew Gibney]], Brother [[Ambrose Treacy]], and the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]].<ref name=History/> The college was the second high school built in Western Australia. It was located in the heart of [[Perth]] on the corner of [[Victoria Avenue, Perth|Victoria Avenue]] and [[St Georges Terrace]].\n\nIn 1938, the boarding school and some day boys moved to the new school at [[Aquinas College, Perth|Aquinas College]], Salter Point. Aquinas inherited the school colours red and black, the school crest and motto, the honour boards, and the school PSA membership and achievements. The new campus at Aquinas depleted student numbers at CBC Perth. Nearby, St Patrick's, a Christian Brothers school in the city on the corner of Wellington and Lord Streets, was overflowing. Many students transferred from St Patrick's, and CBC Perth continued as a day school from 1938. Stripped of its history, traditions and students, CBC Perth raised new honour boards and the colours blue, light blue and green, and the college set about claiming a new heritage which 24 years later would become Trinity College.\n\nWhen Perth won the right to host the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]], the [[City of Perth]] negotiated with the Christian Brothers from 1958-1960 to purchase CBC Perth for \u00a3267,000, in order to widen St Georges Terrace and to construct a new hotel.<ref name=History/> The Chevron-Hilton Hotel Group which had committed to the development, ran into difficulties, and the school buildings remained until demolition in the mid-1960s. The site was vacant until the [[Australian Taxation Office]] building was built there several years later. The building is now the Duxton Hotel. The council provided a {{convert|5.7|ha|acre|0|sing=on}} site for the new college on reclaimed land in [[East Perth, Western Australia|East Perth]] on the banks of the Swan River, next to the [[WACA Ground]], [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]], and [[The Causeway]].<ref name=History/>\n\nBrother J.A.Kelly, headmaster of CBC Perth, and architect Jim Henderson fast tracked construction of Trinity College from 1960 to ensure the college opened in time for the 1962 school year. Even with the pressing deadline, Brother Kelly was instrumental in building the imaginative round chapel at Trinity, and he commissioned Ted Gowers to design the stained glass windows set in concrete.<ref name=TCNews>Trinity News Summer 2012, General - Vale to a Man of Glass p21, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref> At the time, this was the largest work of art undertaken in the post-war years of Western Australia.<ref name=TCNews/> Brother Kelly also commissioned artist Margaret Priest to design and make abstract statues of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], the [[Crucifix]], and the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]].<ref>Trinity News Summer 2012, Archives - The Trinity College Madonna and Child Statue p37, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 6 January 2013</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1961, Trinity College was nearing completion. CBC Perth closed and when St Patrick's closed two years later the two schools became one.<ref>Trinity News Summer 2013, Archives - St Patrick's Celtic Cross p38, TOBA publication 50th anniversary edition, referenced 25 December 2013</ref>\n\n==Trinity==\nIn 1962, Trinity opened as a day school with 830 boys. The official opening was held on 25 March 1962.<ref name=History/> The school had a new crest and motto, and retained the colours and the honour boards of CBC Perth which were raised in 1938. Trinity dominated Association Catholic Colleges sporting events. In 1968, Trinity joined the [[Public Schools Association|PSA]] and the manful rivalry with Aquinas, ''the old foe'', entered a level playing field. In 1972, Trinity won the PSA athletics carnival ending a seven-year winning streak by Aquinas. In the years ahead, coaches and students at Aquinas responded with the call, \"Beat Trinity!\"\n\n===Campus===\nThe college has undergone significant expansion. The original 1962 buildings included Trinity Chapel, A and B blocks, Gibney Hall, the pavilion, a squash and handball court (both demolished late 1999), and the Brothers Monastery (rebuilt into the Junior School in 1991). In 1983, Gibney Hall was widened, by bricking-in the balcony on the western side, and lengthened to accommodate all students and staff at assemblies. Over the years the college has expanded to include Kelly Senior School 1968, Duffy Library 1979, admin block 1981, Foley Physical Education Centre 1992, Treacy Design and Technology Centre 2001, Brockwell Observatory 2001, Curtis Aquatic Centre 2004, and O'Doherty Cultural Education Centre 2010.  In addition to the East Perth campus, the school has Camp Kelly, an outdoor education facility situated 8&nbsp;km south of Dwellingup, and {{convert|10|ha|m2}} of sports ground at Waterford.\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College - View from the Oval.tif|1024px|View from the oval||none}}\n\n===Principals===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Brother JA Kelly, Headmaster Trinity College Perth 1962.tif|60px|thumb|left|Br Kelly, 1962]] -->\n\nBrother Kelly was the last headmaster of CBC Perth and the founding headmaster of Trinity College. He was headmaster during 1962-1966 and he returned again as headmaster during 1978-1984. Four Christian Brothers served as headmaster of the college. Over the years, [[Laity|lay]] teachers gradually replaced Christian Brothers on staff. In 1994, Anthony Curtis was appointed the first lay principal (name changed from headmaster to principal).

It is compulsory for each student to compete in a summer and a winter sport. PSA sports take precedence over sports outside the college. Other than for health reasons, a student may only be exempted from training, matches, or both if the student is selected to train or play at a national or international level when it clashes with college training or PSA competition. The college does not encourage students to try out for higher representative levels if it conflicts with the college PSA sporting schedule. In football, Trinity students typically do not compete for selection for the [[Western Australian Football League]] colts or for Teal Cup teams. This does not hamper future selection opportunities for students. Many students have been selected in the [[Australian Football League]] national draft based on their performance in the PSA. The sporting skills, coaching, fitness and organisation of students from the seven PSA schools is commensurable to the highest levels offered by any schoolboy competition in Western Australia. This is evident by the number of former PSA students who compete in their chosen sports at state, national, international, and Olympic levels.\n\nAs the most recent school in the PSA, Trinity has improved over time and the college has moved up the ranks in most sports. The most notable exception is swimming.\n\nThe main campus at East Perth has one oval which prior to the EPRA land-swap catered for a turf cricket ground in summer, a football oval in winter, and an athletics training track in spring. There are four outdoor [[hardcourts]] marked for tennis and basketball. The campus has a 50m swimming pool and a gymnasium which is marked with basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts. As well, the school has a rowing boathouse on the East Perth foreshore. Courses along [[Heirisson Island]], the Swan River foreshore, and [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] including [[Kings Park, Western Australia#Jacob's Ladder|Jacobs Ladder]] provide excellent cross-country tracks. The East Perth campus lacks dedicated facilities for hockey, rugby and soccer. At various times the college has sought to purchase the land between the college and the Causeway, as well as vacant land on the north side of Gloucester Park. Negotiations for these purchases with the City of Perth have repeatedly fallen through due to town planning intentions. However, the City of Perth has allowed the college to use facilities at Haig Park, which has now been redeveloped by EPRA, and to use facilities at [[Langley Park (Western Australia)|Langley Park]] and [[Wellington Square, Perth|Wellington Square]].\n\nThe Waterford playing fields have five cricket ovals, three turfed and two synthetic pitches. Two turfed pitch ovals become football ovals in winter and the remaining pitches separate into two soccer fields, two hockey fields and one rugby field.\n\nThe senior school holds official college trials and championships for swimming and athletics. Students who advance from the trials compete against each other in the college championships to decide school champions and to decide who qualifies for events on the school teams. Summer and winter team sports hold similar selection procedures relevant to the criteria set-down by each code. College champions for summer and winter team sports are chosen by judging committees who award points for a player's performance for each official PSA fixture. In addition, the college has three major sports awards. The J P Ilich Award for outstanding service to the school in sport, and the Old Boys Awards for the students who score the most points for Trinity at PSA athletics and swimming carnivals.\n\n===School houses===\nTrinity inherited a four [[house system]] from CBC Perth. Each house has a major and a minor colour, a motto and an emblem. Each classroom stream is divided into one of the four houses. Siblings and cousins belong to the house of their eldest relative. When played, competitions are held to decide the House Champion. Currently, the house system is the format for carnival competitions held within the junior school.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Two carnivals, swimming and athletics, are called the Bowers, and the third carnival, cross-country, is called the Sevens. Teams are the same as the home-room class. In the lead up to the swimming and athletics carnivals, each home-room class holds an impromptu meeting to decide the Jack (class captain) and the Dealer (class selector). The tactics of the Dealer are the key to winning a Bowers carnival. Each student must compete in one of the race divisions for each event and the line-ups must be submitted before a Bowers carnival begins. Each race division awards the same points descending from first to last. Calculations using intelligence gathering and misinformation are required to work out the best order to race classmates. One important play is the Jack who is awarded maximum points regardless of where he finishes in a race. Cheating is a permitted tactic. A cheat stands and points awarded if no appeal is made to the carnival judge before the end of a race. If an appeal for cheating is upheld, the cheater forfeits points earned from the race. The winning team is the class which out-trumps the other classes by setting up the most favourable mis-matches in order to score the most points. The cross-country carnival, called the Sevens, is pure in format. No cheats are permitted and the carnival judge may order a cheater to wear a smock-of-shame for a day. The winning team is the first to have seven classmates cross the finishing line. However, there is one important exception. The team with the last seven to cross the finishing line automatically loses. The carnivals may be used for fundraising and nominal wagers by each competitor are put into a kitty. The winning team for each carnival is awarded the right to choose an approved cause to donate the kitty.\n\n===School hymn===\nThe title of the school hymn, \"[[In nomine Domini|In Nomine Domini]]\", is derived from the school motto and [[Psalm]] 123: ''adjutorium nostrum in Nomine Domini,'' \"Our help is in the name of the Lord.\" The hymn was written in 1979 by Father Paul Keyte, the school chaplain at the time. Inspired by the Harrow School Song \"Forty Years On\", Father Keyte wrote in the 1979 School Annual, he was not merely trying to write a hymn but an anthem and something that, \"would not only renew loyalty to the school but would also rekindle the flame of faith\". The music was written by Brother Gerald Crooks, a long serving music teacher at the College. In 1984, Brother Crooks introduced a brass fanfare lead featuring trumpets and trombones. \"In Nomine Domine\" is sung at Speech Nights, Year 12 Graduations, [[ANZAC Day]] ceremonies, and at PSA sporting events.\n\n==International achievements==\n'''International Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2016'''\n\nThe team from Trinity won the Meritous Award - the second highest award category - at the [[International Mathematical Modeling Challenge|International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IM<sup>2</sup>C)]].

In 2005, however, two symmetric [[spiral arm]]s were discovered in [[near-infrared]] (NIR) images of M82.  The arms were detected by subtracting an [[axisymmetric]] exponential disk from the NIR images.  Even though the arms were detected in NIR images, they are bluer than the disk. The arms were previously missed due to M82's high disk [[surface brightness]], the nearly edge-on view of this galaxy (~80\u00b0),<ref name=\"Barkeretal2008\" /> and obscuration by a complex network of dusty filaments in its optical images. These arms emanate from the ends of the NIR [[Barred spiral galaxy|bar]] and can be followed for the length of 3 [[Disc (galaxy)|disc]] scales. Assuming that the northern part of M82 is nearer to us, as most of the literature does, the observed sense of rotation implies trailing arms.<ref name=\"Mayyaetal2005\">\n{{cite journal\n | author=Mayya, Y.
