It was initially broadcast on [[BBC Two]], from 22 February 2007, before moving to [[BBC One]] in October 2009. It currently airs on Friday evenings, and is usually repeated a few nights later.\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020|section}}\n\n===BBC Two===\nThe show mirrors ''So'' and ''V'' with strong adult humour along with Norton's monologue at the beginning of the show and often a musical guest to play out over the credits. Although the rude objects in \"Graham's drawer\" did not survive, the phone calls and hidden camera surprises have. These surprises are sometimes centred on the guests, such as [[Sarah Beeny]]'s dating website, a [[TARDIS]] on the South Bank when [[David Tennant]] appeared and a wine-tasting group drinking [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]]'s wine whilst he was on the show. Some of the surprises, such as the wine-tasting, have been arranged through ideas submitted by viewers, stating where they will be when the show is recorded.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAt the end of the show, after any band or artist performance, an extra five minute section of the show was recorded, known as the \"Cooldown\". This section was seen in an extended weekend repeat, called ''Graham Norton Uncut'', and was also made available as a downloadable [[podcast]]. As well as showing the \"Cooldown\", it also included previously unseen parts from the original episode. This section often involved the audience, such as guessing an audience member's partner or playing mass [[charades]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAfter Norton's short monologue, he always introduced two guests. If there was a third guest, they were usually introduced later in the show. If the two guests are connected in some way (for example, [[Dustin Hoffman]] and his wife), they were the only ones introduced at the start. If musical guests were involved in the show, one of several things happened. Some performers, such as [[Enrique Iglesias]], were on stage from the very beginning. Others, such as [[Gareth Gates]] came on stage about 5 to 7 minutes before their performance for a short interview. Also, some musical guests only performed during the end credits and participated in the Cooldown section of the programme. However, all bands performed during the credits and were interviewed in the Cooldown segment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===BBC One===\nOnce the show moved to BBC One, it moved to Monday nights and the guest list increased to three or occasionally four people, with an accompanying reduction in Norton's signature pieces. A typical show consisted of one big celebrity name, a comedian sitting in the aforementioned ''comedy chair'' and a well-known musical personality who would all be introduced after the monologue. Sometimes, three guests are introduced at the top of the show with the musical guest brought in about 10 to 15 minutes before the end of the show.\n\nUnlike the BBC Two show, the BBC One show does not end with the musical performance, but with a new audience participation segment called ''That's All We've Got Time For'', where audience members sit in the famous red chair and begin to tell a humorous story. Norton and his guests listen to the stories and if Norton gets bored, he \u2013 or occasionally a guest \u2013 pulls the lever and the chair falls backwards, dumping the speaker from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006xnzc |title=The Graham Norton Show |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> The red chair segment was inspired by comedian [[Ronnie Corbett]]'s longwinded armchair monologues.<ref>''The Graham Norton Show'', BBC One, 1 April 2016</ref>\n\nAfter the end of ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', it was announced that ''The Graham Norton Show'' would be taking over the coveted Friday night slot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7892231/Graham-Norton-to-take-over-from-Jonathan-Ross-on-Friday-night-chat-show.html|title=Graham Norton to take over from Jonathan Ross on Friday night chat show|date=2010-07-15|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The show premiered on 22 October 2010.\n\n==Series==\nThe first series began at 10 pm on 22 February 2007 on [[BBC Two]] and was originally slated to end on 24 May 2007 after 13 episodes. However, the series proved such a hit that it was extended for an additional six episodes. A 12-week second series began on 11 October 2007 and culminated with a Boxing Day special and a New Year's compilation from previous episodes.\n\nThe show made its North American premiere on [[BBC America]] on 2 June 2007, one week after what was supposed to be the final episode of Series 1 (before its extension).\n\nSeries 2 premiered on BBC America on 20 October 2007. Unlike the previous series, each episode premiered in the United States only nine days after the initial UK broadcast. However, the final three episodes were broadcast in reverse order (with Episode 12 being shown on BBC America a few days earlier than on BBC Two. The same thing occurred in Series 4 with the Christmas special airing on BBC America 10 days before the BBC Two broadcast.\n\nSeries 3 began its run on 17 April 2008. For series 3, the \"Cooldown\" segment had been dropped and the show was just the full uncut 45-minute version of the show. The show was originally recorded in studio 2 at [[The London Studios]], but moved to studio 1, due to the slot of ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' and the high audience numbers.\n\nThe show continued to be broadcast in a 30-minute version on Thursdays at 10pm with ''Graham Norton Uncut'', the uncut version, shown on Sundays at around 11 pm in a 45-minute version. However, [[BBC Two]] in Wales sometimes broadcast the Thursday edition later than the rest of the BBC Two regions, usually after ''[[Newsnight]]'' at 11.20 pm because they would usually have local programmes in the 10 pm slot. [[BBC Two Northern Ireland]] did the same, and during series three, they broadcast Thursday's show on Friday nights at 10 pm on BBC Two Northern Ireland because of local programming on Thursdays.\n\nSeries 4 began its run on 3 October 2008 at 10 pm on BBC Two (however, both [[BBC Two Wales]] and BBC Two Northern Ireland broadcast the show at a later time due to their regional programming). The Sunday uncut editions have been kept, with the first uncut edition broadcast on BBC Two late on Sunday night.\n\nSince its sixth series, ''The Graham Norton Show'' has aired on [[BBC One]]. As of 2020, there have been 26 series of the show.\n\nIn late January 2017, it was confirmed that Norton had signed a new three-year deal with the BBC which, along with his BBC Radio 2 show, Eurovision commentary duties and other projects for the BBC, will also keep ''The Graham Norton Show'' on BBC One until at least 2020. Norton said: \"I think we've just done a deal for another three years, which, right now, feels like a long time.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/graham-norton-show/news/a819852/graham-norton-bbc-extra-three-years/|title=Graham Norton is sticking with the BBC for another three years \u2013 and he's got his eye on a very special guest|last1=Warner|first1=Sam|last2=Eames|first2=Tom|date=26 January 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n''The Graham Norton Show'' had been produced from the ITV Studios on London's Southbank since it began in 2007. Norton had used the London Studios since 1998 for his first talk show on Channel 4, ''So Graham Norton''. The show produced its final episode from The London Studios on Thursday 15 February 2018 which aired on BBC One on Friday 16 February 2018. At the end of the final show, a photograph was taken of all the crew on the sofa along with Norton, and a caption reading \"Love, thanks and goodbye to The London Studios\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/grantblowers/status/964263081495945218|title=Sidcup Bloke \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa on Twitter|author=|date=|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The production of the show moved to Studio TC1 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in West London, operated by BBC Studioworks.

Norton and his guests listen to the stories and if Norton gets bored, he \u2013 or occasionally a guest \u2013 pulls the lever and the chair falls backwards, dumping the speaker from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006xnzc |title=The Graham Norton Show |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> The red chair segment was inspired by comedian [[Ronnie Corbett]]'s longwinded armchair monologues.<ref>''The Graham Norton Show'', BBC One, 1 April 2016</ref>\n\nAfter the end of ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', it was announced that ''The Graham Norton Show'' would be taking over the coveted Friday night slot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7892231/Graham-Norton-to-take-over-from-Jonathan-Ross-on-Friday-night-chat-show.html|title=Graham Norton to take over from Jonathan Ross on Friday night chat show|date=2010-07-15|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The show premiered on 22 October 2010.\n\n==Series==\nThe first series began at 10 pm on 22 February 2007 on [[BBC Two]] and was originally slated to end on 24 May 2007 after 13 episodes. However, the series proved such a hit that it was extended for an additional six episodes. A 12-week second series began on 11 October 2007 and culminated with a Boxing Day special and a New Year's compilation from previous episodes.\n\nThe show made its North American premiere on [[BBC America]] on 2 June 2007, one week after what was supposed to be the final episode of Series 1 (before its extension).\n\nSeries 2 premiered on BBC America on 20 October 2007. Unlike the previous series, each episode premiered in the United States only nine days after the initial UK broadcast. However, the final three episodes were broadcast in reverse order (with Episode 12 being shown on BBC America a few days earlier than on BBC Two. The same thing occurred in Series 4 with the Christmas special airing on BBC America 10 days before the BBC Two broadcast.\n\nSeries 3 began its run on 17 April 2008. For series 3, the \"Cooldown\" segment had been dropped and the show was just the full uncut 45-minute version of the show. The show was originally recorded in studio 2 at [[The London Studios]], but moved to studio 1, due to the slot of ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' and the high audience numbers.\n\nThe show continued to be broadcast in a 30-minute version on Thursdays at 10pm with ''Graham Norton Uncut'', the uncut version, shown on Sundays at around 11 pm in a 45-minute version. However, [[BBC Two]] in Wales sometimes broadcast the Thursday edition later than the rest of the BBC Two regions, usually after ''[[Newsnight]]'' at 11.20 pm because they would usually have local programmes in the 10 pm slot. [[BBC Two Northern Ireland]] did the same, and during series three, they broadcast Thursday's show on Friday nights at 10 pm on BBC Two Northern Ireland because of local programming on Thursdays.\n\nSeries 4 began its run on 3 October 2008 at 10 pm on BBC Two (however, both [[BBC Two Wales]] and BBC Two Northern Ireland broadcast the show at a later time due to their regional programming). The Sunday uncut editions have been kept, with the first uncut edition broadcast on BBC Two late on Sunday night.\n\nSince its sixth series, ''The Graham Norton Show'' has aired on [[BBC One]]. As of 2020, there have been 26 series of the show.\n\nIn late January 2017, it was confirmed that Norton had signed a new three-year deal with the BBC which, along with his BBC Radio 2 show, Eurovision commentary duties and other projects for the BBC, will also keep ''The Graham Norton Show'' on BBC One until at least 2020. Norton said: \"I think we've just done a deal for another three years, which, right now, feels like a long time.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/graham-norton-show/news/a819852/graham-norton-bbc-extra-three-years/|title=Graham Norton is sticking with the BBC for another three years \u2013 and he's got his eye on a very special guest|last1=Warner|first1=Sam|last2=Eames|first2=Tom|date=26 January 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n''The Graham Norton Show'' had been produced from the ITV Studios on London's Southbank since it began in 2007. Norton had used the London Studios since 1998 for his first talk show on Channel 4, ''So Graham Norton''. The show produced its final episode from The London Studios on Thursday 15 February 2018 which aired on BBC One on Friday 16 February 2018. At the end of the final show, a photograph was taken of all the crew on the sofa along with Norton, and a caption reading \"Love, thanks and goodbye to The London Studios\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/grantblowers/status/964263081495945218|title=Sidcup Bloke \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa on Twitter|author=|date=|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The production of the show moved to Studio TC1 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in West London, operated by BBC Studioworks.

The text was issued at a Vatican press conference on 29 July.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stamane l'atteso documento del Pontefice sulla 'pillola'|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,1/articleid,0121_02_1968_0170_0001_17749612/|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=29 July 1968|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref> Subtitled ''On the Regulation of Birth'', it re-affirmed the teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] regarding [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|married love]], responsible parenthood, and the rejection of artificial [[contraception]]. In formulating his teaching he explained why he did not accept the conclusions of the [[Pontifical Commission on Birth Control]] established by his predecessor, [[Pope John XXIII]], a commission he himself had expanded.<ref>See encyclical, n.6.</ref>\n\nMainly because of its restatement of the Church's opposition to artificial contraception, the encyclical was politically controversial. It affirmed traditional Church [[Catholic moral theology|moral teaching]] on the [[sanctity of life]] and the procreative and unitive nature of conjugal relations.\n\nIt was the last of Paul's seven encyclicals.<ref name=\"paulvi\" />\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Affirmation of traditional teaching===\nIn this encyclical Paul VI reaffirmed the Catholic Church's view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of \"artificial\" [[contraception|birth control]]. There were two Papal committees and numerous independent experts looking into the latest advancement of science and math on the question of artificial birth control,<ref>([http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825 ''Germain Grisez on Human\u00e6 Vitae, Then and Now''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041111093922/http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825# |date=11 November 2004 }}, Retrieved 2 March 2006</ref> which were noted by the Pope in his encyclical.<ref name=HV_2-8>''Humanae Vitae'', nos. 2-8</ref> The expressed views of Paul VI reflected the teachings of his predecessors, especially [[Pius XI]],<ref>Pius XI, encyc.letter ''Divini illius Magistri'': AAS 22 (1930), pgs. 58-61; encyc. letter ''Casti connubii'': AAS 22 (1930), pgs. 545-546</ref> [[Pius XII]]<ref>Discorsi e radiomessaggi di Pio XII, VI, pgs. 191-2; to Italian Association of Catholic Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), pgs. 835-54</ref> and [[John XXIII]],<ref>John XXIII, encyc. letter ''Mater et magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), pg. 457</ref> all of whom had insisted on the divine obligations of the marital partners in light of their partnership with God the creator.\n\n===Doctrinal basis===\n\nPaul VI himself, even as commission members issued their personal views over the years, always reaffirmed the teachings of the Church, repeating them more than once in the first years of his Pontificate.<ref>''Herder Korrespondenz'', Orbis Catholicus Freiburg, Herder Verlag, 1964-1968</ref>\n\nTo Pope Paul VI, marital relations are much more than a union of two people. In his view, they constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons generate the matter for the body, while God creates the unique soul of a person. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of ''Humanae Vitae'', that the \"transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.\"<ref name=HV_1>''Humanae vitae'', no. 1</ref> This is divine partnership, so Paul VI does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. According to Paul VI, marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships.<ref name=\"HV_1\" /> The question of human [[procreation]] with God, exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[demography]] or [[sociology]].<ref name=HV_7>''Humane vitae'', no. 7</ref> According to Paul VI, married love takes its origin from God, who is love, and from this basic dignity, he defines his position:\n{{quote |text=Love is total \u2014 that very special form of personal friendship in which husband and wife generously share everything, allowing no unreasonable exceptions and not thinking solely of their own convenience. Whoever really loves his partner loves not only for what he receives, but loves that partner for the partner's own sake, content to be able to enrich the other with the gift of himself.<ref name=HV_8-9>''Humanae vitae'', nos. 8-9</ref>}}\n\nThe encyclical opens with an assertion of the competency of the [[magisterium]] of the Catholic Church to decide questions of morality. It then goes on to observe that circumstances often dictate that married couples should limit the number of children, and that the sexual act between husband and wife is still worthy even if it can be foreseen not to result in procreation. Nevertheless, it is held that the sexual act must retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.\n\nEvery action specifically intended to prevent procreation is forbidden, except in medically necessary circumstances. Therapeutic means necessary to cure diseases are exempted, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result, but only if infertility is not directly intended.<ref name=HV>''Humanae vitae''</ref> This is held to directly contradict the moral order which was established by God. [[Abortion]], even for therapeutic reasons, is absolutely forbidden, as is [[Human sterilization|sterilization]], even if temporary. Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (''e.g.'', [[hysterectomy]]), if they are not specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), [[Natural family planning]] methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the [[menstrual cycle]]) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.<ref name=HV/>\n\nThe acceptance of artificial methods of birth control is then claimed to result in several negative consequences, among them a general lowering of moral standards resulting from sex without consequences, and the danger that men may reduce women to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of [their] own desires; finally, abuse of power by public authorities, and a false sense of autonomy.<ref name=HV_17>''Humanae vitae'', no. 17</ref>\n\n===Appeal to natural law and conclusion===\nPublic authorities should oppose laws which undermine [[natural law]];<ref name=HV_23>''Humanae vitae'', no. 23</ref> scientists should further study effective methods of natural birth control; doctors should further familiarize themselves with this teaching, in order to be able to give advice to their patients,<ref name=HV_27>''Humanae vitae'', no. 27</ref> priests must spell out clearly and completely the Church's teaching on marriage.<ref name=HV_28>''Humanae vitae'', no. 28</ref> The encyclical acknowledges that \"perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching\", but that \"...it comes as no surprise to the church that she, no less than her Divine founder is destined to be a sign of contradiction.\"<ref name=HV_17/> Noted is the duty of proclaiming the entire moral law, \"both natural and evangelical.\"<ref name=HV_17/> The encyclical also points out that the Roman Catholic Church cannot \"declare lawful what is in fact unlawful\", because she is concerned with \"safeguarding the holiness of marriage, in order to guide married life to its full human and Christian perfection.\"<ref name=HV_30>''Humane vitae'', no. 30</ref> This is to be the priority for his fellow bishops and priests and lay people. The Pope predicts that future progress in social cultural and economic spheres will make marital and family life more joyful, provided God's design for the world is faithfully followed.<ref name=HV_30/> The encyclical closes with an appeal to observe the natural laws of the Most High God. \"These laws must be wisely and lovingly observed.\"<ref name=HV_31>''Humanae vitae'', no. 31</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{See also|Christian views on contraception}}\nThere had been a long-standing general Christian prohibition on contraception and abortion, with such Church Fathers as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] condemning the practices. It was not until the 1930 [[Lambeth Conference]] that the [[Anglican Communion]] allowed for contraception in limited circumstances. [[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] [[Protestant]] denominations have since removed prohibitions against artificial contraception.<ref name=\"flann\">{{cite journal|author=Campbell, Flann|title=Birth Control and the Christian Churches|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1960|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131\u2013147|doi=10.2307/2172010|jstor=2172010}}</ref> In a partial reaction, [[Pope Pius XI]] wrote the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' (''On Christian Marriage'') in 1930, reaffirming the Catholic Church's belief in various traditional Christian teachings on marriage and sexuality, including the prohibition of artificial birth control even within marriage. ''Casti connubii'' is against [[contraception]] and regarding [[natural family planning]] allowed married couples to use their nuptial rights \"in the proper manner\" when because of either time or defects, new life could not be brought forth.<ref name=HV/>\n\n===The commission of John XXIII===\n{{Main|Pontifical Commission on Birth Control}}\nWith the appearance of the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]] in 1960, dissenters in the Church argued for a reconsideration of the Church positions.

As Vatican Council II was concluding, Pope Paul VI enlarged it to fifty-eight members, including married couples, laywomen, theologians and bishops. The last document issued by the council (''Gaudium et spes'') contained a section titled \"Fostering the Nobility of Marriage\" (1965, nos. 47-52), which discussed marriage from the personalist point of view. The \"duty of responsible parenthood\" was affirmed, but the determination of licit and illicit forms of regulating birth was reserved to Pope Paul VI. In the spring of 1966, following the close of the council, the commission held its fifth and final meeting, having been enlarged again to include sixteen bishops as an executive committee. The commission was only consultative but it submitted a report approved by a majority of 64 members to Paul VI. It proposed he approve of artificial contraception without distinction of the various means. A minority of four members opposed this report and issued a parallel report to the Pope.<ref>[{{cite book | last = Rausch | first = Thomas P.  | title = Catholicism in the Third Millennium | publisher = [[Liturgical Press]] | edition = 2nd | location = Collegeville, MN | date = 2003 | page = 148 | isbn = 978-0-8146-5899-4}}]</ref> Arguments in the minority report, against change in the church's teaching, were that \"we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit had been on the side of the Protestant churches in 1930\" (when ''[[Casti connubii]]'' was promulgated) and that \"it should likewise have to be admitted that for a half a century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error.\"<ref>Hasler, A.B.

He explained why he did not accept the opinion of the majority report of the commission (1968, #6).<ref>''Health Care Ethics A Catholic Theological Analysis, Fifth Edition'', Georgetown University Press: 2005; {{ISBN|978-1-58901-116-8}}</ref> Arguments were raised in the decades that followed that his decision has never passed the condition of \"reception\" to become church doctrine.<ref>{{Cite journal| journal = Theological Studies | pages=221\u201357 |url=http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/39/39.2/39.2.1.pdf|title=Humanae Vitae and Its Reception|last =Komonchak |first=Joseph A.|date=|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcc-catholic-rights.net/doctrine_of_reception.htm| title=Doctrine of Reception| website=www.arcc-catholic-rights.net|access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Drafting of the Encyclical===\nIn his role as [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household]] [[Mario Luigi Ciappi]] advised [[Pope Paul VI]] during the drafting of ''Humanae vitae''.  Ciappi, a doctoral graduate of the ''Pontificium Athenaeum Internationale Angelicum'', the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], served as professor of dogmatic theology there and was Dean of the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Theology from 1935 to 1955.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/26830305 Retrieved 13 February 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to [[George Weigel]], Paul VI named Archbishop [[Karol Wojty\u0142a]] (later Pope John Paul II) to the commission, but Polish government authorities would not permit him to travel to [[Rome]]. Wojty\u0142a had earlier defended the church's position from a philosophical standpoint in his 1960 book ''[[Love and Responsibility]]''. Wojty\u0142a's position was strongly considered and it was reflected in the final draft of the encyclical, although much of his language and arguments were not incorporated. Weigel attributes much of the poor reception of the encyclical to the omission of many of Wojty\u0142a's arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weigel|first=George|title=Witness to Hope|publisher=HarperCollins|origyear=1999|year=2001|isbn=978-0-06-018793-4|quote=The encyclical was not drafted precisely as Wojtyla proposed.|url=https://archive.org/details/witnesstohopebio00weig}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, anticipating the 50th anniversary of the encyclical, four theologians led by Mgr. Gilfredo Marengo, a professor of theological anthropology at the [[Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family]], launched a research project he called \"a work of historical-critical investigation without any aim other than reconstructing as well as possible the whole process of composing the encyclical\". Using the resources of the Vatican Secret Archives and the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], they hope to detail the writing process and the interaction between the commission, publicity surrounding the commission's work, and Paul's own authorship.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wooden|first1=Cindy|title=Theologians studying development of Humanae Vitae given access to Vatican Secret Archives|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/07/27/theologians-studying-development-of-humanae-vitae-given-access-to-vatican-secret-archives/|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=Vatholic Herals|date=27 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=San Mart\u00edn|first1=In\u00e9s|title=No, Virginia, there\u2019s no \u2018secret commission\u2019 on Humanae Vitae|url=https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/07/27/no-virginia-theres-no-secret-commission-humanae-vitae/|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=CRUX|date=27 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Faithfulness to God's design===\n13. Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife. If they further reflect, they must also recognize that an act of mutual love which impairs the capacity to transmit life which God the Creator, through specific laws, has built into it, frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage, and contradicts the will of the Author of life. Hence to use this divine gift while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will. But to experience the gift of married love while respecting the laws of conception is to acknowledge that one is not the master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design established by the Creator. Just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body in general, so also, and with more particular reason, he has no such dominion over his specifically sexual faculties, for these are concerned by their very nature with the generation of life, of which God is the source. \"Human life is sacred\u2014all men must recognize that fact,\" Our predecessor Pope John XXIII recalled. \"From its very inception it reveals the creating hand of God.\"<ref>See John XXIII,  encyc. letter Mater et Magistra: AAS 53 (1961), pg. 447 [TPS VII, pg. 331].</ref>\n\n===Lawful therapeutic means===\n15. ...the Church does not consider at all illicit the use of those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result therefrom &mdash; provided such impediment is not directly intended.\n\n===Recourse to infertile periods===\n16. ...If therefore there are well-grounded reasons for spacing births, arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances, the Church teaches that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that are infertile, thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which We have just explained.\n\n===Concern of the Church===\n18. It is to be anticipated that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much clamorous outcry against the voice of the Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication. But it comes as no surprise to the Church that it, no less than its divine Founder, is destined to be a \"sign of contradiction.\"<ref>Lk 2. 34</ref>) The Church does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on it of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical. Since the Church did not make either of these laws, it cannot be their arbiter\u2014only their guardian and interpreter. It could never be right for the Church to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, since that, by its very nature, is always opposed to the true good of man. In preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage, the Church is convinced that it is contributing to the creation of a truly human civilization. The Church urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients. In this way it defends the dignity of husband and wife. This course of action shows that the Church, loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior, is sincere and unselfish in its regard for men whom it strives to help even now during this earthly pilgrimage \"to share God's life as sons of the living God, the Father of all men\".\n\n===Developing countries===\n23. We are fully aware of the difficulties confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter ''Populorum Progressio''. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We make Our own his words: \"No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values.\"<ref>John XXIII, Encyc. letter ''Mater et Magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), pg. 447 [TPS VII, pg. 331]</ref> No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems to be the result of misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.<ref>See Paul VI, encyc. letter ''Populorum progressio'' #48-55: AAS 59 (1967), pgs. 281-4 [TPS XII, pgs. 160-2] \"If only all governments which were able would do what some are already doing so nobly, and bestir themselves to renew their efforts and their undertakings!

The Second Vatican Council did not speak of any of these concrete methods\u2026 This is a different standpoint than that taken under Pius XI some thirty years which was also maintained by his successor ... we can sense here a clear development in the Church, a development, which is also going on outside the Church.\"<ref>''A New Catechism'', pg. 402</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], ''Literaturnaja Gazeta'', a publication of Soviet intellectuals, included an editorial and statement by Russian physicians against the encyclical.<ref>HK 1968, pg. 548</ref>\n\n===Ecumenical reactions===\nEcumenical reactions were mixed.

Moreover, as Patriarch in [[Venice]] some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues as the years went by.\" According to Allen, \"...it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in ''Humanae Vitae'' as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, and probably would not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching.

He reaffirmed much of ''Humanae vitae'', and specifically described the practice of artificial contraception as an act not permitted by Catholic teaching in any circumstances. The same encyclical also clarifies the use of conscience in arriving at moral decisions, including in the use of contraception. However, John Paul also said, \u201cIt is not right then to regard the moral conscience of the individual and the magisterium of the Church as two contenders, as two realities in conflict. The authority which the magisterium enjoys by the will of Christ exists so that the moral conscience can attain the truth with security and remain in it.\u201d John Paul quoted ''Humanae vitae'' as a compassionate encyclical, \"Christ has come not to judge the world but to save it, and while he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin, he was patient and rich in mercy towards sinners\".<ref>''Veritatis Splendor'', pg. 95; see ''Humanae vitae'', no. 29</ref>\n\nPope John Paul's 1995 encyclical, ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' (\"The Gospel of Life\"), affirmed the Church's position on contraception and multiple topics related to the [[culture of life]].\n\n===Pope Benedict XVI===\nOn 12 May 2008, [[Benedict XVI]] accepted an invitation to talk to participants in the International Congress organized by the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] on the 40th anniversary of ''Humanae vitae''. He put the encyclical in the broader view of love in a global context, a topic he called \"so controversial, yet so crucial for humanity's future.\" ''Humanae vitae'' became \"a sign of contradiction but also of continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition... What was true yesterday is true also today.\"<ref>Benedict XVI, international congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of the encyclical ''Humanae vitae'', 12 May 2008</ref> The Church continues to reflect  \"in an ever new and deeper way on the fundamental principles that concern marriage and procreation.\" The key message of ''Humanae vitae'' is love. Benedict states, that the fullness of a person is achieved by a unity of soul and body, but neither spirit nor body alone can love, only the two together. If this unity is broken, if only the body is satisfied, love becomes a commodity.<ref>Quoted from ''Deus Caritas Est''</ref>\n\n===Pope Francis===\nOn 16 January 2015, Pope Francis said to a meeting with families in Manila, insisting on the need to protect the family: \"The family is ...threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life. I think of Blessed Paul VI. At a time when the problem of population growth was being raised, he had the courage to defend openness to life in families. He knew the difficulties that are there in every family, and so in his Encyclical he was very merciful towards particular cases, and he asked confessors to be very merciful and understanding in dealing with particular cases. But he also had a broader vision: he looked at the peoples of the earth and he saw this threat of the destruction of the family through the privation of children [original Spanish: destrucci\u00f3n de la familia por la privaci\u00f3n de los hijos].

But his genius was prophetic, he had the courage to take a stand against the majority, to defend moral discipline, to exercise a cultural restraint, to oppose present and future neo-Malthusianism.

It affirmed traditional Church [[Catholic moral theology|moral teaching]] on the [[sanctity of life]] and the procreative and unitive nature of conjugal relations.\n\nIt was the last of Paul's seven encyclicals.<ref name=\"paulvi\" />\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Affirmation of traditional teaching===\nIn this encyclical Paul VI reaffirmed the Catholic Church's view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of \"artificial\" [[contraception|birth control]]. There were two Papal committees and numerous independent experts looking into the latest advancement of science and math on the question of artificial birth control,<ref>([http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825 ''Germain Grisez on Human\u00e6 Vitae, Then and Now''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041111093922/http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825# |date=11 November 2004 }}, Retrieved 2 March 2006</ref> which were noted by the Pope in his encyclical.<ref name=HV_2-8>''Humanae Vitae'', nos. 2-8</ref> The expressed views of Paul VI reflected the teachings of his predecessors, especially [[Pius XI]],<ref>Pius XI, encyc.letter ''Divini illius Magistri'': AAS 22 (1930), pgs. 58-61; encyc. letter ''Casti connubii'': AAS 22 (1930), pgs. 545-546</ref> [[Pius XII]]<ref>Discorsi e radiomessaggi di Pio XII, VI, pgs. 191-2; to Italian Association of Catholic Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), pgs. 835-54</ref> and [[John XXIII]],<ref>John XXIII, encyc. letter ''Mater et magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), pg. 457</ref> all of whom had insisted on the divine obligations of the marital partners in light of their partnership with God the creator.\n\n===Doctrinal basis===\n\nPaul VI himself, even as commission members issued their personal views over the years, always reaffirmed the teachings of the Church, repeating them more than once in the first years of his Pontificate.<ref>''Herder Korrespondenz'', Orbis Catholicus Freiburg, Herder Verlag, 1964-1968</ref>\n\nTo Pope Paul VI, marital relations are much more than a union of two people. In his view, they constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons generate the matter for the body, while God creates the unique soul of a person. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of ''Humanae Vitae'', that the \"transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.\"<ref name=HV_1>''Humanae vitae'', no. 1</ref> This is divine partnership, so Paul VI does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. According to Paul VI, marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships.<ref name=\"HV_1\" /> The question of human [[procreation]] with God, exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[demography]] or [[sociology]].<ref name=HV_7>''Humane vitae'', no. 7</ref> According to Paul VI, married love takes its origin from God, who is love, and from this basic dignity, he defines his position:\n{{quote |text=Love is total \u2014 that very special form of personal friendship in which husband and wife generously share everything, allowing no unreasonable exceptions and not thinking solely of their own convenience. Whoever really loves his partner loves not only for what he receives, but loves that partner for the partner's own sake, content to be able to enrich the other with the gift of himself.<ref name=HV_8-9>''Humanae vitae'', nos. 8-9</ref>}}\n\nThe encyclical opens with an assertion of the competency of the [[magisterium]] of the Catholic Church to decide questions of morality. It then goes on to observe that circumstances often dictate that married couples should limit the number of children, and that the sexual act between husband and wife is still worthy even if it can be foreseen not to result in procreation. Nevertheless, it is held that the sexual act must retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.\n\nEvery action specifically intended to prevent procreation is forbidden, except in medically necessary circumstances. Therapeutic means necessary to cure diseases are exempted, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result, but only if infertility is not directly intended.<ref name=HV>''Humanae vitae''</ref> This is held to directly contradict the moral order which was established by God. [[Abortion]], even for therapeutic reasons, is absolutely forbidden, as is [[Human sterilization|sterilization]], even if temporary. Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (''e.g.'', [[hysterectomy]]), if they are not specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), [[Natural family planning]] methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the [[menstrual cycle]]) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.<ref name=HV/>\n\nThe acceptance of artificial methods of birth control is then claimed to result in several negative consequences, among them a general lowering of moral standards resulting from sex without consequences, and the danger that men may reduce women to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of [their] own desires; finally, abuse of power by public authorities, and a false sense of autonomy.<ref name=HV_17>''Humanae vitae'', no. 17</ref>\n\n===Appeal to natural law and conclusion===\nPublic authorities should oppose laws which undermine [[natural law]];<ref name=HV_23>''Humanae vitae'', no. 23</ref> scientists should further study effective methods of natural birth control; doctors should further familiarize themselves with this teaching, in order to be able to give advice to their patients,<ref name=HV_27>''Humanae vitae'', no. 27</ref> priests must spell out clearly and completely the Church's teaching on marriage.<ref name=HV_28>''Humanae vitae'', no. 28</ref> The encyclical acknowledges that \"perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching\", but that \"...it comes as no surprise to the church that she, no less than her Divine founder is destined to be a sign of contradiction.\"<ref name=HV_17/> Noted is the duty of proclaiming the entire moral law, \"both natural and evangelical.\"<ref name=HV_17/> The encyclical also points out that the Roman Catholic Church cannot \"declare lawful what is in fact unlawful\", because she is concerned with \"safeguarding the holiness of marriage, in order to guide married life to its full human and Christian perfection.\"<ref name=HV_30>''Humane vitae'', no. 30</ref> This is to be the priority for his fellow bishops and priests and lay people. The Pope predicts that future progress in social cultural and economic spheres will make marital and family life more joyful, provided God's design for the world is faithfully followed.<ref name=HV_30/> The encyclical closes with an appeal to observe the natural laws of the Most High God. \"These laws must be wisely and lovingly observed.\"<ref name=HV_31>''Humanae vitae'', no. 31</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{See also|Christian views on contraception}}\nThere had been a long-standing general Christian prohibition on contraception and abortion, with such Church Fathers as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] condemning the practices. It was not until the 1930 [[Lambeth Conference]] that the [[Anglican Communion]] allowed for contraception in limited circumstances. [[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] [[Protestant]] denominations have since removed prohibitions against artificial contraception.<ref name=\"flann\">{{cite journal|author=Campbell, Flann|title=Birth Control and the Christian Churches|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1960|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131\u2013147|doi=10.2307/2172010|jstor=2172010}}</ref> In a partial reaction, [[Pope Pius XI]] wrote the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' (''On Christian Marriage'') in 1930, reaffirming the Catholic Church's belief in various traditional Christian teachings on marriage and sexuality, including the prohibition of artificial birth control even within marriage. ''Casti connubii'' is against [[contraception]] and regarding [[natural family planning]] allowed married couples to use their nuptial rights \"in the proper manner\" when because of either time or defects, new life could not be brought forth.<ref name=HV/>\n\n===The commission of John XXIII===\n{{Main|Pontifical Commission on Birth Control}}\nWith the appearance of the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]] in 1960, dissenters in the Church argued for a reconsideration of the Church positions.

As Vatican Council II was concluding, Pope Paul VI enlarged it to fifty-eight members, including married couples, laywomen, theologians and bishops. The last document issued by the council (''Gaudium et spes'') contained a section titled \"Fostering the Nobility of Marriage\" (1965, nos. 47-52), which discussed marriage from the personalist point of view. The \"duty of responsible parenthood\" was affirmed, but the determination of licit and illicit forms of regulating birth was reserved to Pope Paul VI. In the spring of 1966, following the close of the council, the commission held its fifth and final meeting, having been enlarged again to include sixteen bishops as an executive committee. The commission was only consultative but it submitted a report approved by a majority of 64 members to Paul VI. It proposed he approve of artificial contraception without distinction of the various means. A minority of four members opposed this report and issued a parallel report to the Pope.<ref>[{{cite book | last = Rausch | first = Thomas P.  | title = Catholicism in the Third Millennium | publisher = [[Liturgical Press]] | edition = 2nd | location = Collegeville, MN | date = 2003 | page = 148 | isbn = 978-0-8146-5899-4}}]</ref> Arguments in the minority report, against change in the church's teaching, were that \"we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit had been on the side of the Protestant churches in 1930\" (when ''[[Casti connubii]]'' was promulgated) and that \"it should likewise have to be admitted that for a half a century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error.\"<ref>Hasler, A.B.

He explained why he did not accept the opinion of the majority report of the commission (1968, #6).<ref>''Health Care Ethics A Catholic Theological Analysis, Fifth Edition'', Georgetown University Press: 2005; {{ISBN|978-1-58901-116-8}}</ref> Arguments were raised in the decades that followed that his decision has never passed the condition of \"reception\" to become church doctrine.<ref>{{Cite journal| journal = Theological Studies | pages=221\u201357 |url=http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/39/39.2/39.2.1.pdf|title=Humanae Vitae and Its Reception|last =Komonchak |first=Joseph A.|date=|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcc-catholic-rights.net/doctrine_of_reception.htm| title=Doctrine of Reception| website=www.arcc-catholic-rights.net|access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Drafting of the Encyclical===\nIn his role as [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household]] [[Mario Luigi Ciappi]] advised [[Pope Paul VI]] during the drafting of ''Humanae vitae''.  Ciappi, a doctoral graduate of the ''Pontificium Athenaeum Internationale Angelicum'', the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], served as professor of dogmatic theology there and was Dean of the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Theology from 1935 to 1955.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/26830305 Retrieved 13 February 2013</ref>\n\nAccording to [[George Weigel]], Paul VI named Archbishop [[Karol Wojty\u0142a]] (later Pope John Paul II) to the commission, but Polish government authorities would not permit him to travel to [[Rome]]. Wojty\u0142a had earlier defended the church's position from a philosophical standpoint in his 1960 book ''[[Love and Responsibility]]''. Wojty\u0142a's position was strongly considered and it was reflected in the final draft of the encyclical, although much of his language and arguments were not incorporated. Weigel attributes much of the poor reception of the encyclical to the omission of many of Wojty\u0142a's arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weigel|first=George|title=Witness to Hope|publisher=HarperCollins|origyear=1999|year=2001|isbn=978-0-06-018793-4|quote=The encyclical was not drafted precisely as Wojtyla proposed.|url=https://archive.org/details/witnesstohopebio00weig}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, anticipating the 50th anniversary of the encyclical, four theologians led by Mgr. Gilfredo Marengo, a professor of theological anthropology at the [[Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family]], launched a research project he called \"a work of historical-critical investigation without any aim other than reconstructing as well as possible the whole process of composing the encyclical\". Using the resources of the Vatican Secret Archives and the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], they hope to detail the writing process and the interaction between the commission, publicity surrounding the commission's work, and Paul's own authorship.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wooden|first1=Cindy|title=Theologians studying development of Humanae Vitae given access to Vatican Secret Archives|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/07/27/theologians-studying-development-of-humanae-vitae-given-access-to-vatican-secret-archives/|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=Vatholic Herals|date=27 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=San Mart\u00edn|first1=In\u00e9s|title=No, Virginia, there\u2019s no \u2018secret commission\u2019 on Humanae Vitae|url=https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/07/27/no-virginia-theres-no-secret-commission-humanae-vitae/|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=CRUX|date=27 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Faithfulness to God's design===\n13. Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife. If they further reflect, they must also recognize that an act of mutual love which impairs the capacity to transmit life which God the Creator, through specific laws, has built into it, frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage, and contradicts the will of the Author of life. Hence to use this divine gift while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will. But to experience the gift of married love while respecting the laws of conception is to acknowledge that one is not the master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design established by the Creator. Just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body in general, so also, and with more particular reason, he has no such dominion over his specifically sexual faculties, for these are concerned by their very nature with the generation of life, of which God is the source. \"Human life is sacred\u2014all men must recognize that fact,\" Our predecessor Pope John XXIII recalled. \"From its very inception it reveals the creating hand of God.\"<ref>See John XXIII,  encyc. letter Mater et Magistra: AAS 53 (1961), pg. 447 [TPS VII, pg. 331].</ref>\n\n===Lawful therapeutic means===\n15. ...the Church does not consider at all illicit the use of those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result therefrom &mdash; provided such impediment is not directly intended.\n\n===Recourse to infertile periods===\n16. ...If therefore there are well-grounded reasons for spacing births, arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances, the Church teaches that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that are infertile, thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which We have just explained.\n\n===Concern of the Church===\n18. It is to be anticipated that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much clamorous outcry against the voice of the Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication. But it comes as no surprise to the Church that it, no less than its divine Founder, is destined to be a \"sign of contradiction.\"<ref>Lk 2. 34</ref>) The Church does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on it of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical. Since the Church did not make either of these laws, it cannot be their arbiter\u2014only their guardian and interpreter. It could never be right for the Church to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, since that, by its very nature, is always opposed to the true good of man. In preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage, the Church is convinced that it is contributing to the creation of a truly human civilization. The Church urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients. In this way it defends the dignity of husband and wife. This course of action shows that the Church, loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior, is sincere and unselfish in its regard for men whom it strives to help even now during this earthly pilgrimage \"to share God's life as sons of the living God, the Father of all men\".\n\n===Developing countries===\n23. We are fully aware of the difficulties confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter ''Populorum Progressio''. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We make Our own his words: \"No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values.\"<ref>John XXIII, Encyc. letter ''Mater et Magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), pg. 447 [TPS VII, pg. 331]</ref> No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems to be the result of misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.<ref>See Paul VI, encyc. letter ''Populorum progressio'' #48-55: AAS 59 (1967), pgs. 281-4 [TPS XII, pgs. 160-2] \"If only all governments which were able would do what some are already doing so nobly, and bestir themselves to renew their efforts and their undertakings! There must be no relaxation in the programs of mutual aid between all the branches of the great human family. Here We believe an almost limitless field lies open for the activities of the great international institutions.\"</ref>\n\n==Response and criticism==\n\n===Galileo affair comparison===\n{{See also|Galileo affair}}\nCardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens]], a moderator of the ecumenical council, questioned, \"whether moral theology took sufficient account of scientific progress, which can help determine, what is according to nature. I beg you my brothers let us avoid another Galileo affair. One is enough for the Church.\"<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite, Paul VI, Paulist Press New York, 1993, pg. 394</ref> In an interview in ''Informations Catholiques Internationales'' on 15 May 1969, he criticized the Pope\u2019s decision again as frustrating the [[Collegiality (Catholic Church)|collegiality]] defined by the Council,<ref>Hebblethwaite, Paul VI, Paulist Press New York, 1993, pg. 533</ref> calling it a non-collegial or even an anti-collegial act.<ref>Hebblethwaite, Paul VI, Paulist Press New York, 1993, pg. 528</ref> He was supported by [[Vatican II]] theologians such as [[Karl Rahner]], [[Hans K\u00fcng]], several [[Episcopal conference]]s, e.g. the [[Episcopal Conference of Austria]], [[Episcopal Conference of Germany|Germany]], and [[Episcopal Conference of Switzerland|Switzerland]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stephanscom.at/edw/predigten/0/articles/2008/10/16/a15468/ |title=Drei Mal \"Nein\" zum Leben |last=Sch\u00f6nborn |first=Christoph |author-link=Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn |date=March 27, 2008 |publisher=Radio Stephansdom |location=Vienna |language=de |trans-title=Three Times \"No\" to Life |type=sermon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130113326/http://stephanscom.at/edw/predigten/0/articles/2008/10/16/a15468/ |archive-date=2009-01-30 |access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref> as well as several bishops, including [[Christopher Butler]], who called it one of the most important contributions to contemporary discussion in the Church.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite, Paul VI, Paulist Press New York, 1993, pg. 533</ref>\n\n===Open dissent===\nThe publication of the encyclical marks the first time in the twentieth century that open dissent from the laity about teachings of the Church was voiced widely and publicly. The teaching has been criticized by development organizations and others who claim that it limits the methods available to fight worldwide population growth and struggle against [[HIV/AIDS]]. Within two days of the encyclical's release, a group of dissident theologians, led by Rev. [[Charles Curran (theologian)|Charles Curran]], then of [[The Catholic University of America]], issued a statement stating, \"spouses may responsibly decide according to their conscience that artificial contraception in some circumstances is permissible and indeed necessary to preserve and foster the value and sacredness of marriage.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://americamagazine.org/node/148840 | work=America | title=Humanae Vitae 25 Years Later | date=7 July 1993 | accessdate=11 November 2013 | first1=Richard | last1=McCormick}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian bishops===\nTwo months later, the controversial \"[[Winnipeg Statement]]\" issued by the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]] stated that those who cannot accept the teaching should not be considered shut off from the Catholic Church, and that individuals can in good conscience use contraception as long as they have first made an honest attempt to accept the difficult directives of the encyclical.\n\n===Dutch Catechism===\nThe Dutch Catechism of 1966, based on the Dutch bishops' interpretation of the just completed Vatican Council, and the first post-Council comprehensive Catholic catechism, noted the lack of mention of artificial contraception in the Council. \"As everyone can ascertain nowadays, there are several methods of regulating births. The Second Vatican Council did not speak of any of these concrete methods\u2026 This is a different standpoint than that taken under Pius XI some thirty years which was also maintained by his successor ... we can sense here a clear development in the Church, a development, which is also going on outside the Church.\"<ref>''A New Catechism'', pg. 402</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], ''Literaturnaja Gazeta'', a publication of Soviet intellectuals, included an editorial and statement by Russian physicians against the encyclical.<ref>HK 1968, pg. 548</ref>\n\n===Ecumenical reactions===\nEcumenical reactions were mixed. Liberal and Moderate [[Lutheran]]s and the [[World Council of Churches]] were disappointed. [[Eugene Carson Blake]] criticised the concepts of nature and [[natural law]], which, in his view, still dominated Catholic theology, as outdated. This concern dominated several articles in Catholic and non-Catholic journals at the time.<ref>''La Croix'', 31 July 1968; 13 August 1968</ref><ref>''Sontagsblatt'', 11 November 1968</ref><ref>''Reforme'', 10 August 1968</ref> [[Patriarch Athenagoras I]] stated his full agreement with [[Pope Paul VI]]: \u201cHe could not have spoken in any other way.\u201d<ref>''Herder Korrespondenz'', Orbis Catholicus, Freiburg, 1968, pg. 404</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\nIn [[Latin America]], much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As [[World Bank]] President [[Robert McNamara]] declared at the 1968 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] that countries permitting [[birth control]] practices will get preferential access to resources, doctors in [[La Paz, Bolivia]], called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation.

On the risk of faith.\" well-known liberal Cardinal [[Carlo Maria Martini]] accused Paul VI of deliberately concealing the truth, leaving it to theologians and pastors to fix things by adapting precepts to practice:\n\"I knew Paul VI well. With the encyclical, he wanted to express consideration for human life. He explained his intention to some of his friends by using a comparison: although one must not lie, sometimes it is not possible to do otherwise; it may be necessary to conceal the truth, or it may be unavoidable to tell a lie.

Allen, Jr.]] claims that \"it's virtually certain that John Paul I would not have reversed Paul VI\u2019s teaching, particularly since he was no doctrinal radical. Moreover, as Patriarch in [[Venice]] some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues as the years went by.\" According to Allen, \"...it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in ''Humanae Vitae'' as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, and probably would not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching. It would have remained a more 'open' question\".<ref>[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word090503.htm ''National Catholic Reporter'']</ref><ref>Kay Withers, \"Pope John Paul I and Birth Control\", ''America'', 24 March 1979, pgs. 233-4</ref> Other sources take a different view and note that during his time as Patriarch of Venice that \"Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception\", though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and failed to live up to the Church's teaching. The book states that \"...if some people think that his compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against Humane Vitae one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception.\"<ref>Raymond and Lauretta, ''The Smiling Pope, The Life & Teaching of John Paul I''. Our Sunday Visitor Press: 2004</ref>\n\n===Pope John Paul II===\nAfter he became pope in 1978, [[John Paul II]] continued on the [[Catholic Theology of the Body]] of his predecessors with a series of lectures, entitled ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', in which he talked about an ''original unity between man and women'',<ref>{{cite book|first=George|last=Weigel|title=Witness to hope, The biography of Pope John Paul II|location=New York|year=2005|page=336}}</ref> purity of heart (on the [[Sermon on the Mount]]), [[marriage]] and [[celibacy]] and reflections on ''Humanae vitae'', focusing largely on responsible parenthood and marital chastity.<ref>Weigel, pgs. 336-43</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the Pope's Apostolic exhortation, [[Familiaris consortio]] restated the Church's opposition to artificial birth control stated previously in Humanae vitae.\n\nJohn Paul II readdressed some of the same issues in his 1993 encyclical [[Veritatis Splendor|''Veritatis splendor'']]. He reaffirmed much of ''Humanae vitae'', and specifically described the practice of artificial contraception as an act not permitted by Catholic teaching in any circumstances. The same encyclical also clarifies the use of conscience in arriving at moral decisions, including in the use of contraception. However, John Paul also said, \u201cIt is not right then to regard the moral conscience of the individual and the magisterium of the Church as two contenders, as two realities in conflict. The authority which the magisterium enjoys by the will of Christ exists so that the moral conscience can attain the truth with security and remain in it.\u201d John Paul quoted ''Humanae vitae'' as a compassionate encyclical, \"Christ has come not to judge the world but to save it, and while he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin, he was patient and rich in mercy towards sinners\".<ref>''Veritatis Splendor'', pg. 95; see ''Humanae vitae'', no. 29</ref>\n\nPope John Paul's 1995 encyclical, ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' (\"The Gospel of Life\"), affirmed the Church's position on contraception and multiple topics related to the [[culture of life]].\n\n===Pope Benedict XVI===\nOn 12 May 2008, [[Benedict XVI]] accepted an invitation to talk to participants in the International Congress organized by the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] on the 40th anniversary of ''Humanae vitae''. He put the encyclical in the broader view of love in a global context, a topic he called \"so controversial, yet so crucial for humanity's future.\" ''Humanae vitae'' became \"a sign of contradiction but also of continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition... What was true yesterday is true also today.\"<ref>Benedict XVI, international congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of the encyclical ''Humanae vitae'', 12 May 2008</ref> The Church continues to reflect  \"in an ever new and deeper way on the fundamental principles that concern marriage and procreation.\" The key message of ''Humanae vitae'' is love. Benedict states, that the fullness of a person is achieved by a unity of soul and body, but neither spirit nor body alone can love, only the two together. If this unity is broken, if only the body is satisfied, love becomes a commodity.<ref>Quoted from ''Deus Caritas Est''</ref>\n\n===Pope Francis===\nOn 16 January 2015, Pope Francis said to a meeting with families in Manila, insisting on the need to protect the family: \"The family is ...threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life. I think of Blessed Paul VI. At a time when the problem of population growth was being raised, he had the courage to defend openness to life in families. He knew the difficulties that are there in every family, and so in his Encyclical he was very merciful towards particular cases, and he asked confessors to be very merciful and understanding in dealing with particular cases. But he also had a broader vision: he looked at the peoples of the earth and he saw this threat of the destruction of the family through the privation of children [original Spanish: destrucci\u00f3n de la familia por la privaci\u00f3n de los hijos]. Paul VI was courageous; he was a good pastor and he warned his flock of the wolves who were coming.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/es/speeches/2015/january/documents/papa-francesco_20150116_srilanka-filippine-incontro-famiglie.html |title = Sri Lanka - Filipinas: Encuentro con las familias en el Mall of Asia Arena (Manila, 16 de enero de 2015) &#124; Francisco}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/82016/the-popes-most-insistent-message | title=The Pope's most insistent message &#124; Inquirer Opinion}}</ref>\n\nA year before, on 1 May 2014, [[Pope Francis]], in an interview given to Italian newspaper ''Corriere della Sera'', expressed his opinion and praise for ''Humanae Vitae'': \"Everything depends on how ''Humanae Vitae'' is interpreted. Paul VI himself, in the end, urged confessors to be very merciful and pay attention to concrete situations. But his genius was prophetic, he had the courage to take a stand against the majority, to defend moral discipline, to exercise a cultural restraint, to oppose present and future neo-Malthusianism. The question is not of changing doctrine, but of digging deep and making sure that pastoral care takes into account situations and what it is possible for persons to do.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350783bdc4.html?eng=y|title=Francis, the Pope of \"Humanae Vitae\"|website=chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Wojty\u0142a\n | first = Karol\n | authorlink = Karol Wojty\u0142a\n | title = Love and Responsibility\n | publisher = Ignatius Press\n | isbn = 978-0-89870-445-7\n | year = 1993\n | url = https://archive.org/details/loveresponsibili00john\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Smith | first = Janet\n | title = Why Humanae Vitae Was Right: A Reader\n | publisher = Ignatius Press\n | isbn = 978-0-89870-433-4 | year = 1993}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Shivanandan | first = Mary\n | title = Crossing the Threshold of Love: A New Vision of Marriage\n | publisher = Catholic University of America Press\n | isbn =  978-0-8132-0941-8 | year = 1999}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Hahn | first = Kimberly\n | title = Life-Giving Love\n | publisher = Charis Books\n | isbn =  978-0-8132-0941-8 | year = 2002}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Kippley | first = John F.\n | title = Sex and the Marriage Covenant: A Basis for Morality\n | publisher =  Ignatius Press\n | isbn =  978-0-89870-973-5 | year = 2005}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = McClory\n | first = Robert\n | title = Turning point: the inside story of the Papal Birth Control Commission, and how Humanae Vitae changed the life of Patty Crowley and the future of the church\n | publisher = Crossroads Publishing\n | isbn = 978-0-8245-1458-7\n | year = 1995\n | url = https://archive.org/details/turningpointinsi0000mccl\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Rubio | first = Julie Hanlon\n | title = Beyond the LIberal/Conservative Divide on Contraception\n | journal = [[Horizons (journal)|Horizons: The Journal of the College Theology Society]]\n | publisher = Villanova University\n | volume = 32 | issue = 2\n |date=Fall 2005}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Dominion | first = Jack\n |author2=Hugh Montefiore\n | title = God, Sex and Love\n | publisher = SCM Press | year = 1989}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html Latin text of ''Humanae vitae''] at the Vatican website\n* [http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html English text of ''Humanae vitae''] at the Vatican website\n* [http://www.viastuas.net.au/bc/WeigelHV.html The Humanae Vitae controversy], chapter from George Weigel's biography of Karol Wojty\u0142a\n* [[G.
