The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the Helix pomatia, commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== List of edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Mating and egg laying ==\n\n=== General ===\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n=== ''Helix pomatia'' ===\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n=== ''Helix aspersa'' ===\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n=== ''Achatina fulica'' ===\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n== Growth ==\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n== Pens and enclosures ==\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n== Cannibalism by hatchlings ==\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n== Feeding ==\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n== Diseases and pests ==\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n== Population density ==\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}</ref>\n\n== Restrictions and regulations in the United States ==\nThe same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use.

This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== List of edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Mating and egg laying ==\n\n=== General ===\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n=== ''Helix pomatia'' ===\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n=== ''Helix aspersa'' ===\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n=== ''Achatina fulica'' ===\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n== Growth ==\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n== Pens and enclosures ==\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n== Cannibalism by hatchlings ==\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n== Feeding ==\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n== Diseases and pests ==\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n== Population density ==\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}</ref>\n\n== Restrictions and regulations in the United States ==\nThe same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "name_user": "Chescargot", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliciculture"}

{"title_page": "The Lion and the Jewel", "text_new": "{{short description|Play by Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka}}\n{{italic title}}  \n'''''The Lion and the Jewel''''' is a play by [[Nigerian]] writer [[Wole Soyinka]] that was first performed in 1959. It chronicles how Baroka, the lion, fights with the modern Lakunle over the right to marry Sidi, the titular Jewel. Lakunle is portrayed as the civilized antithesis of Baroka and unilaterally attempts to modernize his community and change its social conventions for no reason other than the fact that he can. The transcript of the play was first published in 1962 by [[Oxford University Press]]. Soyinka emphasises the theme of the corrupted African culture through the play, as well as how the youth should embrace the original African culture\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Main characters'''\n* '''Baroka''' \u2013 The Bal\u00e8 or [[viceroyal]] [[chieftain]] of Ilujinle, a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] village in the realm of the [[Ibadan|Ibadan clan's kingdom]]. A crafty individual, he is the Lion referred to in the title. At 62 years of age, he has already sired 63 children thanks to polygamy.\n* '''Lakunle'''\u2013 The progressive and absurdly arrogant Westernised teacher. He is in his twenties. He appears to only be semi-literate.\n* '''Sidi'''\u2013 A beautiful yet somewhat egotistical village girl who is wooed by both Baroka and Lakunle. She is also the village belle. She is the titular Jewel.\n* '''Sadiku''' \u2013 The chief's sly [[Great Wife|senior wife]], chieftess of his [[harem]].\n* '''Ailatu''' \u2013 Baroka's [[favourite]], who loses her place in his affections due to her jealousy.\n\n'''Supporting characters'''\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|date=October 2014}}\nThe play takes place over a Sunday. It is divided into three parts: morning, noon, and night.\n\n===Morning===\nA school teacher, Lakunle, is teaching a class when Sidi walks fast carrying a pail of water on her head. The teacher peers out of the window and disappears. Two 11-year-old school children start ogling her, so he hits them on the head and leaves to confront her. Lakunle comes out and insists on taking the pail from Sidi. She refuses, saying that she would look silly. Lakunle replies, saying that he told her not to carry loads on her head or her neck may be shortened. He also tells her not to expose so much of her cleavage with the cloth she wears around her breasts. Sidi says that it is too inconvenient for her to do so. She scolds him, saying that the village thinks he's stupid, but Lakunle says that he is not so easily cowed by taunts. Lakunle also insults her saying that her brain is smaller than his, making her angry.\n\nAfter arguing, Sidi wants to leave, but Lakunle tells her of his love for her, but she remains indifferent. Eventually, it is revealed that Sidi does not want to marry him because Lakunle refuses to pay her bride-price as he thinks it is an uncivilized, outrageous custom. Sidi tells him that if she did so, people will jeer at her, saying that she is not a virgin. Lakunle further professes how he wants to marry her and treat her \"just like the Lagos couples I have seen\". Sidi does not care. She also says that she finds the Western custom of kissing repulsive. She tells him that not paying her [[bride price]] is mean and miserly.\n\nAs the village girls enter, they play \"The Dance of the Lost Traveller\", which features the sudden arrival of a photographer in their midst some time ago. They tease the traveller in the play, calling his motorbike \"the devil's own horse\" and the camera that he used to take pictures \"the one-eyed box\". Four girls dance the \"devil-horse\", a youth is selected to play the snake, and Lakunle becomes the Traveller. He seeks to be excused to teach Primary Four Geography but Sidi informs him that the village is on holiday due to the arrival of the photographer/traveler.\n\nWe also find out that the photographer made a picture book about the village based on the photos he took. There is a picture of Sidi on the front page, and a two-page spread of her somewhere inside. Baroka is featured too, but he \"is in a little corner somewhere in the book, and even tphat corner he shares with one of the village latrines\". They banter about for a while, Lakunle gave in and participated because he couldn't tolerate being taunted by them.\n\n'''The Dance of the Lost Traveller'''<br>\nThe four girls kneeled on the ground, forming the wheels of the car. Lakunle adjusts their position and sits in air in the middle. He pretends to drive the \"car\". The girls dance the stall. They shudder, and drop their faces onto their laps. He pretends to try to restart the \"car\". He gets out and checks the \"wheels\" and also pinches them. He tries to start the \"car\", fails and takes his things for a trek.\n\nHe hears a girl misbehaving, but attributes it to sunstroke, so he throws the bottle that he was drinking from in that general direction. He hears a scream and a torrent of abuse. He takes a closer look and sees a girl (played by Sidi). He tries to take photos, but falls down into the stream.\n\nThe cast assembles behind him, pretending to be villagers in an ugly mood hauling him to the maram in the town centre. Then Baroka appears and the play stops. He talks to Lakunle for a while, saying that he knew how the play went and was waiting for the right time to step in. He drops subtle hints of an existing feud between him and Lakunle, then makes the play continue. The villagers once again start thirsting for his blood. He is hauled before Baroka, thrown on his face. He tries to explain his plight. Baroka seems to understand and orders a feast in the Lost Traveller's honour. He then takes the opportunity to take more photos of Sidi. He is also pressed to drink lots of alcohol, and at the end of the play, he is close to vomiting.\n\nThe play ends. Sidi praises him for his performance. Lakunle runs away, followed by a flock of women. Baroka and the wrestler sit alone. Baroka takes out his book, and muses that it has been five full months since he last took a wife.\n\n===Noon===\nSidi is at a road near the marketplace. Lakunle follows her, while carrying the firewood that Sidi asked him to help her get. She admires the pictures of her in the magazine. Then Sadiku appears wearing a shawl over her head. She informs her that the Lion (Baroka) wishes to take her as a wife. Lakunle is outraged, but Sidi stops him. Lakunle changes tactics, telling her as his lover to ignore the message. Sadiku took that as a yes, but Sidi dashed her hopes, saying that since her fame had spread to Lagos and the rest of the world, she deserves more than that. Sadiku presses on, dissembling that Baroka has sworn not to take any more wives after her and that she would be his favourite and would get many privileges, including being able to sleep in the palace rather than one of the outhouses. As Baroka's last wife, she would also be able to become the first, and thus head wife, of his successor, in the same way that Sadiku was Baroka's head wife. However, Sidi sees through her lies, and tells her that she knew that he just wanted fame \"as the one man who has possessed 'the jewel of Ilujinle'\". Sadiku is flabbergasted and wants to kill Lakunle for what he has done to her.\n\nSidi shows the magazine. She says that in the picture, she looks absolutely beautiful while he simply looks like a ragged, blackened piece of saddle leather: she is youthful but he is spent. Sadiku changes techniques, saying that if Sidi does not want to be his wife, will she be kind enough to attend a small feast in her honour at his house that night. Sidi refuses, saying that she knows that every woman who has eaten supper with him eventually becomes his wife. Lakunle interjects, informing them that Baroka was known for his wiliness, particularly when he managed to foil the Public Works attempt to build a railroad through Ilujinle. Baroka bribed the surveyor for the route to move the railroad much farther away as \"the earth is most unsuitable, could not possibly support the weight of a railway engine\". Lakunle is distraught, as he thinks just how close Ilujinle was to civilisation at that time.\n\nThe scene cuts to Baroka's bedroom. Ailatu is plucking his armpit hairs. There is a strange machine with a long lever at the side. It is covered with animal skins and rugs. Baroka mentions that she is too soft with her pulls. Then he tells her that he plans to take a new wife, but that he would let her be the \"sole out-puller of my sweat-bathed hairs\". She is angry, and deliberately plucks the next few hairs a lot harder. Sadiku enters. He shoos Ailatu away, lamenting about his bleeding armpit.\n\nSadiku informs him that she failed to woo Sidi. She told her that Sidi flatly refused her order, claiming that he was far too old. Baroka pretends to doubt his manliness and asks Sadiku to massage the soles of his feet. Sadiku complies. He lies to her that his manhood ended a week ago, specifically warning her not to tell anyone. He comments that he is only 62. Compared to him, his grandfather had fathered two sons late on 65 and Okiki, his father, produced a pair of female twins at 67. Finally Baroka falls asleep.\n\n===Night===\nSidi is at the village center, by the schoolroom window. Enter Sadiku, who is carrying a bundle. She sets down a figure by the tree. She gloats, saying that she has managed to be the undoing (making him impotent) of Baroka, and of his father, Okiki, before that. Sidi is amazed at what she initially perceives to be Sadiku going mad. She shuts the window and exits, shocking Sadiku. After a pause, Sadiku resumes her victory dance and even asks Sidi to join in. Then Lakunle enters. He scorns them, saying: \"The full moon is not yet, but the women cannot wait. They must go mad without it.\" Sidi and Sadiku stop dancing. They talk for a while. As they are about to resume dancing, Sidi states her plans to visit Baroka for his feast and toy with him. Lakunle tries in vain to stop her, telling her that if her deception were to be discovered she would be beaten up. Sidi leaves. Lakunle and Sadiku converse. Lakunle states his grand plans to modernize the area by abolishing the bride-price, building a motor-road through the town and bring city ways to isolated Ilujinle. He goes on to spurn her, calling her a bride-collector for Baroka.\n\nThe scene is now Baroka's bedroom. Baroka is arm-wrestling the wrestler seen earlier. He is surprised that she (Sidi) managed to enter unchallenged. Then he suddenly remembers that that day was the designated day off for the servants. He laments that Lakunle had made his servants form an entity called the Palace Workers' Union. He asks if Ailatu was at her usual place, and was disappointed to find out that she had not left him yet despite scolding her severely. Then Sidi mentions that she was here for the supper. Sidi starts playing around with Baroka. She asks him what was up between him and Ailatu. He is annoyed. Changing the subject, Sidi says that she thinks Baroka will win the ongoing arm-wrestling match. Baroka responds humbly, complimenting the strength and ability of the wrestler. She slowly teases Baroka, asking if he was planning to take a wife. She draws an example, asking if he was her father, would he let her marry a person like him?\n\nSidi takes this opportunity to slightly tease him, and is rewarded by his violent reaction by taking the wrestler and slinging him over his shoulder. The wrestler quickly recovers and a new match begins again. The discussion continues. Baroka is hurt by the parallels and subtle hints about his nature dropped by Sidi. Sidi even taunts him, saying that he has failed to produce any children for the last two years. Eventually he is so angered that he slams the wrestler's arm down on the table, winning the match. He tells the defeated wrestler to get the fresh gourd by the door. In the meantime, Baroka tries to paint himself as a grumpy old man with few chances to show his kindliness. The wrestler returns. Baroka continues with his self-glorification. Then he shows her the now-familiar magazine and an addressed envelope. He shows her a stamp, featuring her likeness, and tells her that her picture would adorn the official stamp of the village. The machine at the side of his room is also revealed to be a machine to produce stamps. As she admires the pictures of her in the magazine, Baroka happens to mention that he does not hate progress, only its nature which made \"all roofs and faces look the same\". He continues praising Sidi's looks, appealing to her.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the village centre, where Lakunle is pacing in frustration. He is mad at Sadiku for tricking her to go see Baroka, and at the same time concerned that Baroka will harm or imprison her. Some mummers arrive. Sadiku remains calm, despite Lakunle's growing stress. Sadiku steals a coin from Lakunle to pay the mummers. In return, the mummers drum her praises, but Sadiku claims that Lakunle was the real benefactor. Then they dance the Baroka story, showing him at his prime and his eventual downfall. Lakunle is pleased by the parts where they mock Baroka. Sadiku mentions that she used to be known as Sadiku of the duiker's feet because she could twist and untwist her waist with the smoothness of a water snake.\n\nSidi appears. She is distraught. Lakunle is outraged, and plans to bring the case to court. Sidi reveals that Baroka only told her at the end that it was a trap. Baroka said that he knew that Sadiku would not keep it to herself, and go out and mock his pride. Lakunle is overcome with emotion, and after at first expressing deep despair, he offers to marry her instead, with no bride-price since she is not a virgin after all. Lakunle is pleased that things have gone as he hoped. Sadiku tells him that Sidi is preparing for a wedding. Lakunle is very happy, saying he needs a day or two to get things ready for a proper Christian wedding. Then musicians appear. Sidi appears, bearing a gift. She tells Lakunle that he is invited to her wedding. Lakunle hopes that the wedding will be between Sidi and himself, but she informs him that she has no intention of marrying him, but rather will marry Baroka. Lakunle is stunned. Sidi says that between Baroka and him, at sixty, Baroka is still full of life but Lakunle would be probably \"ten years dead\". Sadiku then gives Sidi her blessing. The marriage ceremony continues. A young girl taunts Lakunle, and he gives chase. Sadiku gets in his way. He frees himself and clears a space in the crowd for them both to dance.\n\nThe drama ends.\n\n==Themes==\nThe most prominent theme of this story is the rapid modernisation of Africa, coupled with the rapid evangelisation of the population. This has driven a wedge between the traditionalists, who seek to nullify the changes done in the name of progress due to vested interests or simply not liking the result of progress, and the modernists, who want to see the last of outdated traditional beliefs at all cost.\n\nAnother core theme is the marginalisation of women as property. Traditionally, they were seen as properties that could be bought, sold or accumulated. Even the modern Lakunle falls victim to this, by looking down on Sidi for having a smaller brain, and later by thinking it will be easier to marry her once she's lost her virginity, since no dowry was required in such a situation.\n\nThere is also the conflict between education and traditional beliefs. The educated people seek to spread their knowledge to the tribal people in an attempt to make them more modern. This in turn is resisted by the tribal people who see no point in obtaining an education as it served them no use in their daily lives.\n\nFinally, there is the importance of song and dance as a form of spreading information in a world where the fastest route of communication is by foot. It is also an important source of entertainment for the otherwise bored village youths. The author shows the slow influence of modernisation, for example, the wondering traveller influences Sidi's life drastically.\n\n==Critical reception==\n* ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'': \"In this richly ribald comedy, The Lion and the Jewel, poetry and prose are also blended, but with a marvelous lightness in the treatment of both. The big set-piece of miming in the opening scene, where the villagers re-enact the visit of the white photographer, and the seduction of the village jewel Sidi by the old Lion of a chief, are two of the pinnacles of Mr. Soyinka's achievement to date.\"\n* ''African Forum'': \"The contemporary theater seems to have forgotten that it has its roots in ritual and song, and it is only the rare emergence of a Lorca or a Brecht-or a Wole Soyinka-that recreates an awareness of our deprivation.\"\n* ''[[West Africa]]'': \"...a brilliant dramatist-the most important in Nigeria, if not in all of Black Africa. He is helped by a profound command of the English language, reflected sometimes in the dazzling brilliance, at other times in the intense poetic quality of his writing....\"\n* ''[[The Times Educational Supplement]]'': \"He does not use the culture of his ancestors as a gimmick to sell his abilities or even as an export commodity, but as inborn material for expansion. His skilful use of idiom with the lively and musical Nigerian flavour in no way detracts from the command of the English language which he possesses.\"\n* ''[[The Times]]'', at the time of the play's production at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, in December 1966: \"This is the third play by Wole Soyinka to appear in London since last year, and this work alone is enough to establish Nigeria as the most fertile new source of English-speaking drama since Synge's discovery of the Western Isles.... Even this comparison does Soyinka less than justice, for he is dealing not only with rich folk material, but with the impact of the modern on tribal custom: to find any parallel for his work in English drama, you have to go back to the Elizabethans.\"\n\nThe play is written in poetry form.\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557228/Wole-Soyinka#ref=ref162235 \"Wole Soyinka\"], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''\n* Taubman, Howard (April 18, 1965), \"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F15F73E5812738DDDA10994DC405B858AF1D3 A Nigerian Looks At 'Progress']\", ''[[The New York Times]]''.\n* Brians, Paul (February 22, 2003), \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110410092723/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/anglophone/soyinka.html#lion Wole Soyinka Study Guide]\"\n* Thurman, Chris (April 19), \"[http://www.christhurman.net/art-and-culture/item/a-discourse-of-gender-in-africa.html Review: \"The Lion and the Jewel\"], [[Business Day (South Africa)|''Business Day'' (South Africa)]].\n* Soyinka, Wole, \"[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=13871569 The Lion and The Jewel]\"\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Wole Soyinka}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lion And The Jewel, The}}\n[[Category:1959 plays]]\n[[Category:Nigerian plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Wole Soyinka]]\n[[Category:Plays set in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Yoruba culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Play by Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka}}\n{{italic title}}  \n'''''The Lion and the Jewel''''' is a play by [[Nigerian]] writer [[Wole Soyinka]] that was first performed in 1959. It chronicles how Baroka, the lion, fights with the modern Lakunle over the right to marry Sidi, the titular Jewel. Lakunle is portrayed as the civilized antithesis of Baroka and unilaterally attempts to modernize his community and change its social conventions for no reason other than the fact that he can. The transcript of the play was first published in 1962 by [[Oxford University Press]]. Soyinka emphasises the theme of the corrupted African culture through the play, as well as how the youth should embrace the original African culture\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Main characters'''\n* '''Baroka''' \u2013 The Bal\u00e8 or [[viceroyal]] [[chieftain]] of Ilujinle, a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] village in the realm of the [[Ibadan|Ibadan clan's kingdom]]. A crafty individual, he is the Lion referred to in the title. At 62 years of age, he has already sired 63 children thanks to polygamy.\n* '''Lakunle'''\u2013 The progressive and absurdly arrogant Westernised teacher. He is in his twenties. He appears to only be semi-literate.\n* '''Sidi'''\u2013 A beautiful yet somewhat egotistical village girl who is wooed by both Baroka and Lakunle. She is also the village belle. She is the titular Jewel.\n* '''Sadiku''' \u2013 The chief's sly [[Great Wife|senior wife]], chieftess of his [[harem]].\n* '''Ailatu''' \u2013 Baroka's [[favourite]], who loses her place in his affections due to her jealousy.\n\n'''Supporting characters'''\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|date=October 2014}}\nThe play takes place over a Sunday. It is divided into three parts: morning, noon, and night.\n\n===Morning===\nA school teacher, Lakunle, is teaching a class when Sidi walks fast carrying a pail of water on her head. The teacher peers out of the window and disappears. Two 11-year-old school children start ogling her, so he hits them on the head and leaves to confront her. Lakunle comes out and insists on taking the pail from Sidi. She refuses, saying that she would look silly. Lakunle replies, saying that he told her not to carry loads on her head or her neck may be shortened. He also tells her not to expose so much of her cleavage with the cloth she wears around her breasts. Sidi says that it is too inconvenient for her to do so. She scolds him, saying that the village thinks he's stupid, but Lakunle says that he is not so easily cowed by taunts. Lakunle also insults her saying that her brain is smaller than his, making her angry.\n\nAfter arguing, Sidi wants to leave, but Lakunle tells her of his love for her, but she remains indifferent. Eventually, it is revealed that Sidi does not want to marry him because Lakunle refuses to pay her bride-price as he thinks it is an uncivilized, outrageous custom. Sidi tells him that if she did so, people will jeer at her, saying that she is not a virgin. Lakunle further professes how he wants to marry her and treat her \"just like the Lagos couples I have seen\". Sidi does not care. She also says that she finds the Western custom of kissing repulsive. She tells him that not paying her [[bride price]] is mean and miserly.\n\nAs the village girls enter, they play \"The Dance of the Lost Traveller\", which features the sudden arrival of a photographer in their midst some time ago. They tease the traveller in the play, calling his motorbike \"the devil's own horse\" and the camera that he used to take pictures \"the one-eyed box\". Four girls dance the \"devil-horse\", a youth is selected to play the snake, and Lakunle becomes the Traveller. He seeks to be excused to teach Primary Four Geography but Sidi informs him that the village is on holiday due to the arrival of the photographer/traveler.\n\nWe also find out that the photographer made a picture book about the village based on the photos he took. There is a picture of Sidi on the front page, and a two-page spread of her somewhere inside. Baroka is featured too, but he \"is in a little corner somewhere in the book, and even tphat corner he shares with one of the village latrines\". They banter about for a while, Lakunle gave in and participated because he couldn't tolerate being taunted by them.\n\n'''The Dance of the Lost Traveller'''<br>\nThe four girls kneeled on the ground, forming the wheels of the car. Lakunle adjusts their position and sits in air in the middle. He pretends to drive the \"car\". The girls dance the stall. They shudder, and drop their faces onto their laps. He pretends to try to restart the \"car\". He gets out and checks the \"wheels\" and also pinches them. He tries to start the \"car\", fails and takes his things for a trek.\n\nHe hears a girl misbehaving, but attributes it to sunstroke, so he throws the bottle that he was drinking from in that general direction. He hears a scream and a torrent of abuse. He takes a closer look and sees a girl (played by Sidi). He tries to take photos, but falls down into the stream.\n\nThe cast assembles behind him, pretending to be villagers in an ugly mood hauling him to the  the maram in the town centre. Then Baroka appears and the play stops. He talks to Lakunle for a while, saying that he knew how the play went and was waiting for the right time to step in. He drops subtle hints of an existing feud between him and Lakunle, then makes the play continue. The villagers once again start thirsting for his blood. He is hauled before Baroka, thrown on his face. He tries to explain his plight. Baroka seems to understand and orders a feast in the Lost Traveller's honour. He then takes the opportunity to take more photos of Sidi. He is also pressed to drink lots of alcohol, and at the end of the play, he is close to vomiting.\n\nThe play ends. Sidi praises him for his performance. Lakunle runs away, followed by a flock of women. Baroka and the wrestler sit alone. Baroka takes out his book, and muses that it has been five full months since he last took a wife.\n\n===Noon===\nSidi is at a road near the marketplace. Lakunle follows her, while carrying the firewood that Sidi asked him to help her get. She admires the pictures of her in the magazine. Then Sadiku appears wearing a shawl over her head. She informs her that the Lion (Baroka) wishes to take her as a wife. Lakunle is outraged, but Sidi stops him. Lakunle changes tactics, telling her as his lover to ignore the message. Sadiku took that as a yes, but Sidi dashed her hopes, saying that since her fame had spread to Lagos and the rest of the world, she deserves more than that. Sadiku presses on, dissembling that Baroka has sworn not to take any more wives after her and that she would be his favourite and would get many privileges, including being able to sleep in the palace rather than one of the outhouses. As Baroka's last wife, she would also be able to become the first, and thus head wife, of his successor, in the same way that Sadiku was Baroka's head wife. However, Sidi sees through her lies, and tells her that she knew that he just wanted fame \"as the one man who has possessed 'the jewel of Ilujinle'\". Sadiku is flabbergasted and wants to kill Lakunle for what he has done to her.\n\nSidi shows the magazine. She says that in the picture, she looks absolutely beautiful while he simply looks like a ragged, blackened piece of saddle leather: she is youthful but he is spent. Sadiku changes techniques, saying that if Sidi does not want to be his wife, will she be kind enough to attend a small feast in her honour at his house that night. Sidi refuses, saying that she knows that every woman who has eaten supper with him eventually becomes his wife. Lakunle interjects, informing them that Baroka was known for his wiliness, particularly when he managed to foil the Public Works attempt to build a railroad through Ilujinle.

In the years following [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] death in 1924, he rose to become the authoritarian leader of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n[[stalin before the Revolution|After growing up in Georgia, Stalin conducted activities for the Bolshevik party]] for twelve years before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. After being elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee in April 1917, Stalin helped [[Lenin]] to evade capture by authorities and ordered the besieged Bolsheviks to surrender to avoid a bloodbath. The Bolsheviks then seized [[Petrograd]] and Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs.\n\nIn the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] that followed between [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] Red Army against the [[White Army]], Stalin formed alliances with [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Semyon Budyonny]] while leading troops in the [[Caucasus]]. There, he ordered the killings of former Tsarist officers and counter-revolutionaries and burned villages to intimidate the peasantry into submission and discourage food bandit raids. After their Civil War victory, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with [[Poland]], which was fighting the Red Army in [[Ukraine]]. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine, Stalin's actions in the war were later criticized, including by [[Leon Trotsky]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|EaGeorgia]] to a family of limited financial means.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''Stalin: A Political Biography'' (Oxford University Press: New York, 1967) p. 2.</ref>  He was the fourth child born to the family of Ekaterina Gheladze and Vissarion Djugashvili; the prior three children of the couple had died at an early age.<ref>Isaac Deutscher, ''Stalin: A Political Biography'', p. 2.</ref>  Stalin later became politically active and, during the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution of 1905]], organized and armed [[Bolshevik]] militias across Georgia, running protection rackets and waging guerrilla warfare. After meeting [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] at a Bolshevik conference in 1906 and marrying  [[Ekaterina Svanidze]], with whom he had a son [[Yakov Dzhugashvili|Yakov]], Stalin temporarily resigned from the party over its ban on bank robberies. Embarking on an effort to organize Muslim [[Azeri]] and [[Persia]]n partisans in the [[Caucasus]], Stalin conducted protection rackets, ransom kidnappings, counterfeiting operations and robberies, until arrest and exile in 1908.\n\nBetween 1908 and 1917, Stalin was arrested seven times and escaped five times, enjoying less than two years of liberty in the nine-year period.<ref>[[Helen Rappaport]]. ''Joseph Stalin: a biographical companion.'' 1999, page 330</ref>\n\n==Role during the Russian Revolution of 1917==\n{{Further|Russian Revolution of 1917}}\n\n===Supporting revolution and saving Lenin===\nIn the wake of the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 (the first phase of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]), Stalin was released from exile. On March 25 he returned to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] (Saint Petersburg) with just a typewriter and a wicker suitcase, wearing a suit he had on in 1913 when he was arrested.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 262</ref> On March 28, together with [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Matvei Muranov]] Stalin ousted [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]] as editors of ''[[Pravda]]'', the official Bolshevik newspaper, while Lenin and much of the Bolshevik leadership were still in exile. Stalin and the new editorial board took a position in favor of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] (Molotov and Shlyapnikov had wanted to overthrow it) and went to the extent of declining to publish Lenin's 'letters from afar' arguing for the provisional government to be overthrown. He described them as \"Unsatisfactory...a sketch with no facts.\"<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 271</ref>\n\nFor a week from March 13, Stalin stopped writing articles, this may have been when he switched to Lenin's position.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 268</ref> However, after Lenin prevailed at the April Party conference, Stalin and the rest of the ''Pravda'' staff came on board with Lenin's view and called for overthrowing the provisional government. At this April 1917 Party conference, Stalin was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee with 97 votes in the party, the third highest after [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and Lenin.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 272</ref> These three plus Kamenev formed the Central Committee's Bureau. Stalin would share a flat with Molotov where he apologised: \"You were the nearest of all to Lenin in the initial stage in April.\"<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 274</ref>\n\nOn June 24, Stalin threatened to resign when Lenin turned against the idea of an armed demonstration when the Soviet refused to support it. It went ahead anyway on July 1 and was a Bolshevik triumph.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 275</ref>\n\nIn mid-July, armed mobs led by Bolshevik militants took to the streets of Petrograd, killing army officers and who were considered bourgeois civilians. Sailors from [[Kronstadt]] phoned Stalin asking if an armed uprising was feasible. He said: \"Rifles? You comrades know best.\" This was enough encouragement for them.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 276</ref> They demanded the overthrow of the government, but neither the Bolshevik leadership nor the [[Petrograd Soviet]] was willing to take power, having been totally surprised by this unplanned revolt. After the disappointed mobs dispersed, [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky's]] government struck back at the Bolsheviks. Loyalist troops raided ''Pravda'' on July 18 and surrounded the Bolshevik headquarters. Stalin helped [[Lenin]] evade capture minutes before and, to avoid a bloodbath, ordered the besieged Bolsheviks in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] to surrender.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\">Simon Sebag Montefiore. Young Stalin. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-297-85068-7}}</ref>\n\nStalin put Lenin in five different hiding places, the last being the Alliluyev family apartment. Convinced Lenin would be killed if caught, Stalin persuaded him not to surrender and smuggled him to [[Finland]]{{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. He shaved off Lenin's beard and moustache, took him to Primorsky station then to a shack north of Petrograd, then to a barn in Finland.<ref>AlliluyevaSimon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 281</ref> In Lenin's absence, Stalin assumed leadership of the Bolsheviks{{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. At the [[6th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)|Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party]], held secretly in [[Petrograd]], Stalin gave the main report, was chosen to be the chief editor of the Party press and a member of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], and was re-elected to the Central Committee.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\"/>\n\n===The coup of General Lavr Kornilov, August 1917===\nIn {{OldStyleDate|September|1917|August}}, [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] suspected his newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, General [[Lavr Kornilov]], of planning a coup and dismissed him ({{OldStyleDate|10 September|1917|27 August}}). Believing that Kerensky had acted under Bolshevik pressure, Kornilov decided to [[Kornilov affair | march his troops]] on [[Petrograd]]. In desperation, Kerensky turned to the [[Petrograd Soviet]] for help and released the Bolsheviks, who raised a small army to defend the capital. In the end, Kerensky convinced Kornilov's army to stand down and to disband without violence.\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nThe Bolsheviks now found themselves free, rearmed, swelling with new recruits and under Stalin's firm control, whilst Kerensky had few troops loyal to him in the capital. Lenin decided that the time for a coup had arrived. [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] proposed a coalition with the Mensheviks, but Stalin and [[Trotsky]] backed Lenin's wish for an exclusively Bolshevik government. [[Lenin]] returned to [[Petrograd]] in October. On October 23, the Central Committee voted 10-2 in favor of an insurrection; Kamenev and Zinoviev voted in opposition.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\"/>\n\nOn the morning of {{OldStyleDate| 6 November|1917|25 October}} Kerensky's troops raided Stalin's press headquarters and smashed his printing presses. While he worked to restore his presses, Stalin missed a Central Committee meeting where assignments for the coup were being issued. Stalin instead spent the afternoon briefing Bolshevik delegates and passing communications to and from [[Lenin]], who was in hiding.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\"/>\n\nEarly the next day, Stalin went to the [[Smolny Institute]] from where he, [[Lenin]] and the rest of the Central Committee coordinated the coup. Kerensky left the capital to rally the Imperial troops at the German front. By {{OldStyleDate| 8 November|1917|27 October}}, the Bolsheviks had \"stormed\" the [[Winter Palace]] and arrested most of the members of Kerensky's cabinet.\n\n==Establishing government==\n\nOn 7 November (O.S. 26 October) 1917, Lenin officially proclaimed the existence of the new Bolshevik government,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=349}} which became known as \"Sovnarkom\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=354}} Stalin was not yet well known to the Russian public, but was included on a list of new People's Commissars\u2014effectively government ministers\u2014under the name of \"J. V. Djugashvili-Stalin\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=349}} Stalin moved into the Smolny Institute, where Sovnarkom was then based.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}} It was probably Lenin who had proposed Stalin for the position of People's Commissar of Nationalities, and while Stalin had initially turned down the post, he ultimately relented.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=343}} He and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] were also tasked with ensuring that Petrograd was defended from Kerensky's Cossack forces which had rallied in the [[Pulkovo Heights]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}}\n\nDuring the first few months of the new government, Lenin, Stalin, and Trotsky formed what the historian [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] described as an \"inseparable troika\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}} Lenin recognised both Stalin and Trotsky as \"men of action\" who stood out in this regard from many of the other senior Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}} On 29 November, the Bolshevik Central Committee established a four-man [[Chetverka]] to lead the country; it consisted of Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=351}}\n\nOn 7 December, Lenin's government formed the [[Cheka]], a political police force.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}} On 27 October, they banned opposition press.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=351}}\nStalin supported the use of terror from the beginning;{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}} in response to a message from Estonian Bolsheviks suggesting how they could deal with opponents, he stated that \"the idea of a concentration camp is excellent\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}}\n\n==Role in the Russian Civil War, 1917\u20131919==\n{{Further|Russian Civil War}}\n\nUpon seizing [[Petrograd]], the Bolsheviks formed the new revolutionary authority, the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Council of People's Commissars]]. Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs; his job was to establish an institution to win over non-Russian citizens of the former Russian Empire. He was relieved of his post as editor of ''Pravda'' so that he could devote himself fully to his new role.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\">Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-330-41913-0}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1918, the Menshevik leader [[Julius Martov]] published an article exposing Bolshevik crimes committed before the revolution. Martov wrote that Stalin had organized bank robberies and had been expelled from his own party for doing so (the latter part is untrue). Stalin sued Martov for libel and won.\n\nAfter seizing Petrograd, civil war broke out in Russia, pitting [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] Red Army against the [[White Army]], a loose alliance of anti-Bolshevik forces. Lenin formed an eight-member [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] which included Stalin and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]. During this time, only Stalin and Trotsky were allowed to see Lenin without an appointment.\n\nIn May 1918, Lenin dispatched Stalin to the city of [[Tsaritsyn]] (later known as Stalingrad, now Volgograd). Situated on the [[Volga River|Lower Volga]], it was a key supply route to the oil and grain of the North Caucasus. There was a critical shortage of food in Russia, and Stalin was assigned to procure any he could find according to [[Prodrazvyorstka]] policy. The city was also in danger of falling to the [[White Army]]. He opposed the \u201c[[military specialist]]s\u201d\u2014 former [[Tsar]]ist professional military officers\u2014 and formed the \"Tsaritsyn group,\" a loose group of like-minded [[Bolshevik]] military leaders and party members personally loyal to Stalin. In doing so, he first met and befriended [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Semyon Budyonny]], both of whom would become two of Stalin's key supporters in the military. Through his new allies, he imposed his influence on the military; in July [[Lenin]] granted his request for official control over military operations in the region to fight the [[Battle for Tsaritsyn]].<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\nStalin challenged many of the decisions of [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], who at this time was Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and thus his military superior. He ordered the killings of many former Tsarist officers in the Red Army; Trotsky, in agreement with the Central Committee, had hired them for their expertise, but Stalin distrusted them, seizing documents which showed many were agents for the White Army.<ref>Ian Grey, Stalin: Man of History (New York: Doubleday & Co, 1979).</ref> This created friction between Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin even wrote to Lenin asking that Trotsky be relieved of his post.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\nStalin ordered the executions of any suspected counter-revolutionaries.<ref name=\"RedTsar\">Simon Sebag Montefiore.

To stem mass desertions and defections of Red Army soldiers, Stalin had deserters and renegades rounded up and publicly executed as traitors.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\n==Role in the Polish-Soviet War, 1919\u20131920==\n{{Further|Soviet-Polish War}}\n\nAfter the Bolsheviks turned the tide and were winning the civil war in late 1919, Lenin and many others wanted to expand the revolution westwards into Europe, starting with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was fighting the Red Army in Byelorussia and the [[Ukraine]]. Stalin, in Ukraine at the time, argued these ambitions were unrealistic, but lost. He was briefly transferred to the Caucasus in February 1920, but managed to get transferred back to Ukraine in May where he accepted the position of the [[Political commissar|Comissar]] of the South-West Front (commander [[Alexander Ilyich Yegorov|Alexander Yegorov]]).<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/><ref name=\" Adam Bruno Ulam\">''Stalin: The Man and His Era'', Beacon Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-8070-7005-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A1eYKftgwgYC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&sig=_e0xasWyvPEw8iaZgY9EL8v_6yg Google Print, p.189]</ref>\n\nIn late July 1920, Yegorov moved against the then-Polish city of [[Lw\u00f3w]], which conflicted with the general strategy set by Lenin and Trotsky by drawing his troops further away from the forces advancing on [[Warsaw]]. In mid-August the Commander-in-Chief [[Sergei Kamenev]] ordered the transfer of troops ([[1st Cavalry Army]], commanded by [[Semyon Budyonny]] and [[Kliment Voroshilov]]) from Yegorov's forces to reinforce the attack on Warsaw led by [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]. Stalin refused to counter-sign the order because it did not have the requisite two signatures on it, a reasonable response.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> In the end, the battles for both Lw\u00f3w and Warsaw were lost, and Stalin's actions were held partly to blame.\n\n[[Richard Pipes]] suggested Lenin was more to blame, for ordering Soviet troops south to spread revolution to Romania, and north to secure the Polish corridor for Germany (this would win over German nationalists). Both these diversions weakened the Soviet assault. Much blame must be laid on the overall commander, Kamenev, for permitting insubordination from both front commanders and conflicting and ever changing strategic orders during the critical phase in the attack on Warsaw.\n\nStalin returned to Moscow in August 1920, where he defended himself before the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] by attacking the whole campaign strategy. Although this tactic worked, he nonetheless resigned his military commission, something he had repeatedly threatened to do when he didn't get his way.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> At the Ninth Party Conference on September 22, Trotsky openly criticized Stalin's war record. Stalin was accused of insubordination, personal ambition, military incompetence and seeking to build his own reputation by victories on his own front at the expense of operations elsewhere. Neither he nor anybody else challenged these attacks; he only briefly reaffirmed his position that the war itself was a mistake, something which everybody agreed on by this point.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Joseph Stalin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stalin, Joseph}}\n[[Category:Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Delegates VIII Congress of the RKP(b).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stalin among other participants to the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)]], 1919.]]\n[[Joseph Stalin]] was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'s [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] from 1922 until his death in 1953.

Stalin and the new editorial board took a position in favor of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] (Molotov and Shlyapnikov had wanted to overthrow it) and went to the extent of declining to publish Lenin's 'letters from afar' arguing for the provisional government to be overthrown. He described them as \"Unsatisfactory...a sketch with no facts.\"<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 271</ref>\n\nFor a week from March 13, Stalin stopped writing articles, this may have been when he switched to Lenin's position.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 268</ref> However, after Lenin prevailed at the April Party conference, Stalin and the rest of the ''Pravda'' staff came on board with Lenin's view and called for overthrowing the provisional government. At this April 1917 Party conference, Stalin was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee with 97 votes in the party, the third highest after [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and Lenin.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 272</ref> These three plus Kamenev formed the Central Committee's Bureau. Stalin would share a flat with Molotov where he apologised: \"You were the nearest of all to Lenin in the initial stage in April.\"<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 274</ref>\n\nOn June 24, Stalin threatened to resign when Lenin turned against the idea of an armed demonstration when the Soviet refused to support it. It went ahead anyway on July 1 and was a Bolshevik triumph.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 275</ref>\n\nIn mid-July, armed mobs led by Bolshevik militants took to the streets of Petrograd, killing army officers and who were considered bourgeois civilians. Sailors from [[Kronstadt]] phoned Stalin asking if an armed uprising was feasible. He said: \"Rifles? You comrades know best.\" This was enough encouragement for them.<ref>Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 276</ref> They demanded the overthrow of the government, but neither the Bolshevik leadership nor the [[Petrograd Soviet]] was willing to take power, having been totally surprised by this unplanned revolt. After the disappointed mobs dispersed, [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky's]] government struck back at the Bolsheviks. Loyalist troops raided ''Pravda'' on July 18 and surrounded the Bolshevik headquarters. Stalin helped [[Lenin]] evade capture minutes before and, to avoid a bloodbath, ordered the besieged Bolsheviks in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] to surrender.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\">Simon Sebag Montefiore. Young Stalin. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-297-85068-7}}</ref>\n\nStalin put Lenin in five different hiding places, the last being the Alliluyev family apartment. Convinced Lenin would be killed if caught, Stalin persuaded him not to surrender and smuggled him to [[Finland]]{{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. He shaved off Lenin's beard and moustache, took him to Primorsky station then to a shack north of Petrograd, then to a barn in Finland.<ref>AlliluyevaSimon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 281</ref> In Lenin's absence, Stalin assumed leadership of the Bolsheviks{{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. At the [[6th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)|Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party]], held secretly in [[Petrograd]], Stalin gave the main report, was chosen to be the chief editor of the Party press and a member of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], and was re-elected to the Central Committee.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\"/>\n\n===The coup of General Lavr Kornilov, August 1917===\nIn {{OldStyleDate|September|1917|August}}, [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] suspected his newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, General [[Lavr Kornilov]], of planning a coup and dismissed him ({{OldStyleDate|10 September|1917|27 August}}). Believing that Kerensky had acted under Bolshevik pressure, Kornilov decided to [[Kornilov affair | march his troops]] on [[Petrograd]]. In desperation, Kerensky turned to the [[Petrograd Soviet]] for help and released the Bolsheviks, who raised a small army to defend the capital. In the end, Kerensky convinced Kornilov's army to stand down and to disband without violence.\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nThe Bolsheviks now found themselves free, rearmed, swelling with new recruits and under Stalin's firm control, whilst Kerensky had few troops loyal to him in the capital. Lenin decided that the time for a coup had arrived. [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] proposed a coalition with the Mensheviks, but Stalin and [[Trotsky]] backed Lenin's wish for an exclusively Bolshevik government. [[Lenin]] returned to [[Petrograd]] in October. On October 23, the Central Committee voted 10-2 in favor of an insurrection; Kamenev and Zinoviev voted in opposition.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\"/>\n\nOn the morning of {{OldStyleDate| 6 November|1917|25 October}} Kerensky's troops raided Stalin's press headquarters and smashed his printing presses. While he worked to restore his presses, Stalin missed a Central Committee meeting where assignments for the coup were being issued. Stalin instead spent the afternoon briefing Bolshevik delegates and passing communications to and from [[Lenin]], who was in hiding.<ref name=\"Young Stalin\"/>\n\nEarly the next day, Stalin went to the [[Smolny Institute]] from where he, [[Lenin]] and the rest of the Central Committee coordinated the coup. Kerensky left the capital to rally the Imperial troops at the German front. By {{OldStyleDate| 8 November|1917|27 October}}, the Bolsheviks had \"stormed\" the [[Winter Palace]] and arrested most of the members of Kerensky's cabinet.\n\n==Establishing government==\n\nOn 7 November (O.S. 26 October) 1917, Lenin officially proclaimed the existence of the new Bolshevik government,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=349}} which became known as \"Sovnarkom\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=354}} Stalin was not yet well known to the Russian public, but was included on a list of new People's Commissars\u2014effectively government ministers\u2014under the name of \"J. V. Djugashvili-Stalin\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=349}} Stalin moved into the Smolny Institute, where Sovnarkom was then based.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}} It was probably Lenin who had proposed Stalin for the position of People's Commissar of Nationalities, and while Stalin had initially turned down the post, he ultimately relented.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=343}} He and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] were also tasked with ensuring that Petrograd was defended from Kerensky's Cossack forces which had rallied in the [[Pulkovo Heights]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}}\n\nDuring the first few months of the new government, Lenin, Stalin, and Trotsky formed what the historian [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] described as an \"inseparable troika\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}} Lenin recognised both Stalin and Trotsky as \"men of action\" who stood out in this regard from many of the other senior Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=350}} On 29 November, the Bolshevik Central Committee established a four-man [[Chetverka]] to lead the country; it consisted of Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=351}}\n\nOn 7 December, Lenin's government formed the [[Cheka]], a political police force.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}} On 27 October, they banned opposition press.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=351}}\nStalin supported the use of terror from the beginning;{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}} in response to a message from Estonian Bolsheviks suggesting how they could deal with opponents, he stated that \"the idea of a concentration camp is excellent\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}}\n\n==Role in the Russian Civil War, 1917\u20131919==\n{{Further|Russian Civil War}}\n\nUpon seizing [[Petrograd]], the Bolsheviks formed the new revolutionary authority, the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Council of People's Commissars]]. Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs; his job was to establish an institution to win over non-Russian citizens of the former Russian Empire. He was relieved of his post as editor of ''Pravda'' so that he could devote himself fully to his new role.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\">Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-330-41913-0}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1918, the Menshevik leader [[Julius Martov]] published an article exposing Bolshevik crimes committed before the revolution. Martov wrote that Stalin had organized bank robberies and had been expelled from his own party for doing so (the latter part is untrue). Stalin sued Martov for libel and won.\n\nAfter seizing Petrograd, civil war broke out in Russia, pitting [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] Red Army against the [[White Army]], a loose alliance of anti-Bolshevik forces. Lenin formed an eight-member [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] which included Stalin and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]. During this time, only Stalin and Trotsky were allowed to see Lenin without an appointment.\n\nIn May 1918, Lenin dispatched Stalin to the city of [[Tsaritsyn]] (later known as Stalingrad, now Volgograd). Situated on the [[Volga River|Lower Volga]], it was a key supply route to the oil and grain of the North Caucasus. There was a critical shortage of food in Russia, and Stalin was assigned to procure any he could find according to [[Prodrazvyorstka]] policy. The city was also in danger of falling to the [[White Army]]. He opposed the \u201c[[military specialist]]s\u201d\u2014 former [[Tsar]]ist professional military officers\u2014 and formed the \"Tsaritsyn group,\" a loose group of like-minded [[Bolshevik]] military leaders and party members personally loyal to Stalin. In doing so, he first met and befriended [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Semyon Budyonny]], both of whom would become two of Stalin's key supporters in the military. Through his new allies, he imposed his influence on the military; in July [[Lenin]] granted his request for official control over military operations in the region to fight the [[Battle for Tsaritsyn]].<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\nStalin challenged many of the decisions of [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], who at this time was Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and thus his military superior. He ordered the killings of many former Tsarist officers in the Red Army; Trotsky, in agreement with the Central Committee, had hired them for their expertise, but Stalin distrusted them, seizing documents which showed many were agents for the White Army.<ref>Ian Grey, Stalin: Man of History (New York: Doubleday & Co, 1979).</ref> This created friction between Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin even wrote to Lenin asking that Trotsky be relieved of his post.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\nStalin ordered the executions of any suspected counter-revolutionaries.<ref name=\"RedTsar\">Simon Sebag Montefiore. ''Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar'', Knopf, 2004 ({{ISBN|1-4000-4230-5}}).</ref> In the countryside, he burned villages to intimidate the peasantry into submission and discourage bandit raids on food shipments.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\nIn May 1919, Stalin was dispatched to the Western Front, near [[Petrograd]]. To stem mass desertions and defections of Red Army soldiers, Stalin had deserters and renegades rounded up and publicly executed as traitors.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\n==Role in the Polish-Soviet War, 1919\u20131920==\n{{Further|Soviet-Polish War}}\n\nAfter the Bolsheviks turned the tide and were winning the civil war in late 1919, Lenin and many others wanted to expand the revolution westwards into Europe, starting with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was fighting the Red Army in Byelorussia and the [[Ukraine]]. Stalin, in Ukraine at the time, argued these ambitions were unrealistic, but lost. He was briefly transferred to the Caucasus in February 1920, but managed to get transferred back to Ukraine in May where he accepted the position of the [[Political commissar|Comissar]] of the South-West Front (commander [[Alexander Ilyich Yegorov|Alexander Yegorov]]).<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/><ref name=\" Adam Bruno Ulam\">''Stalin: The Man and His Era'', Beacon Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-8070-7005-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A1eYKftgwgYC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&sig=_e0xasWyvPEw8iaZgY9EL8v_6yg Google Print, p.189]</ref>\n\nIn late July 1920, Yegorov moved against the then-Polish city of [[Lw\u00f3w]], which conflicted with the general strategy set by Lenin and Trotsky by drawing his troops further away from the forces advancing on [[Warsaw]]. In mid-August the Commander-in-Chief [[Sergei Kamenev]] ordered the transfer of troops ([[1st Cavalry Army]], commanded by [[Semyon Budyonny]] and [[Kliment Voroshilov]]) from Yegorov's forces to reinforce the attack on Warsaw led by [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]. Stalin refused to counter-sign the order because it did not have the requisite two signatures on it, a reasonable response.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> In the end, the battles for both Lw\u00f3w and Warsaw were lost, and Stalin's actions were held partly to blame.\n\n[[Richard Pipes]] suggested Lenin was more to blame, for ordering Soviet troops south to spread revolution to Romania, and north to secure the Polish corridor for Germany (this would win over German nationalists). Both these diversions weakened the Soviet assault. Much blame must be laid on the overall commander, Kamenev, for permitting insubordination from both front commanders and conflicting and ever changing strategic orders during the critical phase in the attack on Warsaw.\n\nStalin returned to Moscow in August 1920, where he defended himself before the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] by attacking the whole campaign strategy. Although this tactic worked, he nonetheless resigned his military commission, something he had repeatedly threatened to do when he didn't get his way.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/> At the Ninth Party Conference on September 22, Trotsky openly criticized Stalin's war record. Stalin was accused of insubordination, personal ambition, military incompetence and seeking to build his own reputation by victories on his own front at the expense of operations elsewhere. Neither he nor anybody else challenged these attacks; he only briefly reaffirmed his position that the war itself was a mistake, something which everybody agreed on by this point.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Joseph Stalin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stalin, Joseph}}\n[[Category:Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin]]\n", "name_user": "98.24.177.147", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin_in_the_Russian_Revolution,_Russian_Civil_War,_and_Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War"}
