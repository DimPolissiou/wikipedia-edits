With the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] both water supply and sanitation stagnated\u2014or regressed\u2014for well over 1,000 years.  Improvement was very slow, with little effective progress made until the growth of modern densely populated cities in the 1800s. During this period, [[public health]] authorities began pressing for better waste disposal systems to be installed, to prevent or control [[epidemic]]s of disease. Earlier, the waste disposal system had consisted of collecting waste and dumping it on the ground or into a river. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems eliminated open sewage ditches and [[cesspit|cesspools]].\n\nMost large cities today pipe solid wastes to [[sewage treatment]] plants in order to separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, [[galvanized iron]] piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with flared fittings, then with rigid copper tubing utilizing soldered fittings.\n\nThe use of lead for potable water declined sharply after [[World War II]] because of increased awareness of the dangers of [[lead poisoning]]. At this time, copper piping was introduced as a better and safer alternative to lead pipes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Public Notice .Lead Contamination Informative City Ok Moscow Water System|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&dat=19880812&id=EZUrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AdEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3819,1428737|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 12, 1988}}</ref>\n\n== Systems ==\n[[File:Cu pipe leonard.jpg|thumb|[[Copper]] piping system in a building]]\nThe major categories of plumbing systems or subsystems are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Plumbing System|url=http://www.slideshare.net/haroldtaylor1113/10-basic-plumbing-system|accessdate=4 January 2016|date=January 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* potable cold and hot [[tap water]] supply\n* [[plumbing drainage venting]]\n* [[sewage system]]s and [[septic system]]s with or without [[hot water heat recycling]] and [[graywater]] recovery and treatment systems\n* Rainwater, surface, and subsurface water drainage\n* [[fuel gas]] piping\n* [[hydronics]], i.e. heating and cooling systems utilizing water to transport thermal energy, as in [[district heating]] systems, like for example the [[New York City steam system]].\n\n==Water pipes==\n{{distinguish|Hookah|Bong}}\n[[File:Waterpipes.jpeg|thumb|200px|A system of [[copper]] water [[Tubing (material)|tubes]] used in a [[radiator]] heating system.]]\n\nA ''water pipe'' is a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] or [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]], frequently made of plastic or metal,{{efn|Materials used to make water pipes are [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], [[ductile iron]], [[cast iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and formerly [[lead]].}} that carries [[Pressure|pressurized]] and [[Water purification|treated]] [[fresh water]] to a building (as part of a [[municipal water system]]), as well as inside the building.\n\n===History===\n{{Main|History of water supply and sanitation}}\n[[File:Canalisation machine de Marly.jpg|thumb|Old water pipe, remnant of the [[Machine de Marly]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], France]]\n\n[[Lead]] was the favoured material for water pipes for many centuries because its [[ductility|malleability]] made it practical to [[metalsmith|work]] into the desired shape. Such use was so common that the word \"plumbing\" derives from ''plumbum'', the [[Latin]] word for lead. This was a source of lead-related health problems in the years before the [[lead poisoning|health hazards of ingesting lead]] were fully understood; among these were [[stillbirth]]s and high rates of [[infant mortality]]. Lead water pipes were still widely used in the early 20th century and remain in many households. Lead-tin [[alloy]] [[solder]] was commonly used to join [[copper pipe]]s, but modern practice uses tin-antimony alloy solder instead in order to eliminate lead hazards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lead in Drinking Water|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/lead/|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=22 January 2014|date=February 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Romans' common use of lead pipes, [[Roman aqueduct|their aqueducts]] rarely poisoned people.

Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.\n\n[[Cast iron pipe|Cast iron]] and [[ductile iron pipe]] was long a lower-cost alternative to copper before the advent of durable plastic materials but special non-conductive fittings must be used where transitions are to be made to other metallic pipes (except for terminal fittings) in order to avoid corrosion owing to electrochemical reactions between dissimilar metals (see [[galvanic cell]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Types of Pipe Material|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/material.html|publisher=Virginia's Community Colleges|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Bronze]] fittings and short pipe segments are commonly used in combination with various materials.<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/232263/market-for-water-equipment/ Worldwide Market for Industrial and Domestic Water Equipment as of 2010].

Retrieved January 28, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Difference between pipes and tubes==\n[[File:Watermain.jpg|thumb|Typical PVC municipal water main being installed in Ontario, Canada]]\n[[File:FlexibleRainPipe.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A plastic water pipe being installed. Note that the inner tube is actually transporting the water, while the outer tube only serves as a protective casing]]\n\nThe difference between pipes and tubes is a matter of sizing. For instance, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe for plumbing applications and galvanized steel pipe are measured in [[iron pipe size]] (IPS). Copper tube, [[CPVC]], [[PEX|PeX]] and other tubing is measured nominally, basically an average diameter. These sizing schemes allow for universal adaptation of transitional fittings. For instance, 1/2\" PeX tubing is the same size as 1/2\" copper tubing. 1/2\" PVC on the other hand is not the same size as 1/2\" tubing, and therefore requires either a threaded male or female adapter to connect them.  When used in agricultural irrigation, the singular form \"pipe\" is often used as a plural.<ref name=\"etb\">{{cite web|title=Difference between Pipes and Tubes|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pipes-tubes-d_347.html|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nPipe is available in rigid ''joints'', which come in various lengths depending on the material. Tubing, in particular copper, comes in rigid hard tempered joints or soft tempered (annealed) rolls. PeX and CPVC tubing also comes in rigid joints or flexible rolls. The temper of the copper, whether it is a rigid joint or flexible roll, does not affect the sizing.<ref name=\"etb\" />\n\nThe thicknesses of the water pipe and tube walls can vary. Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the [[Standard Dimension Ratio]] (SDR), defined as the ratio of the pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter).\n\nWall thickness does not affect pipe or tubing size.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wall thickness does not affect pipe o|url=http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903072809/http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|archivedate=September 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 1/2\" L copper has the same outer diameter as 1/2\" K or M copper. The same applies to pipe schedules. As a result, a slight increase in pressure losses is realized due to a decrease in flowpath as wall thickness is increased. In other words, 1 foot of 1/2\" L copper has slightly less volume than 1 foot of 1/2 M copper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Materials ===\nWater systems of ancient times relied on gravity for the supply of water, using pipes or channels usually made of [[clay]], [[lead]], bamboo, wood, or stone. Hollowed wooden logs wrapped in steel banding were used for plumbing pipes, particularly water mains. Logs were used for water distribution in England close to 500 years ago. US cities began using hollowed logs in the late 1700s through the 1800s.  Today, most plumbing supply pipe is made out of steel, copper, and plastic; most waste (also known as \"soil\")<ref name=cispi>http://www.cispi.org/products/types.aspx{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute</ref> out of steel, copper, plastic, and cast iron.<ref name=cispi />\n\nThe straight sections of plumbing systems are called \"pipes\" or \"tubes\". A pipe is typically formed via [[casting]] or [[welding]], whereas a tube is made through [[extrusion]]. Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as [[brazing]], [[compression fitting]], [[crimp (joining)|crimping]], or for plastics, [[solvent welding]].  These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the [[piping and plumbing fittings]] article.\n\n==== Steel ====\n{{Main|Galvanized pipe}}\n[[Galvanized steel]] potable water supply and distribution [[pipe (material)|pipes]] are commonly found with [[nominal pipe size]]s from {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} to {{convert|2|in|mm}}. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has [[National Pipe Thread]] (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, [[valve]]s, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as \"'''galv'''\" or \"'''iron'''\" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a [[pipe threader]]. It remains in common use for repair of existing \"galv\" systems and to satisfy [[building code]] non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse.  Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for [[fire sprinkler]]s and natural gas.\n\nMost typical single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than {{convert|3/4|in|mm}} due to expense as well as steel piping's tendency to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.\n\n==== Copper ====\n{{Main|Copper tubing}}\n\nCopper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the latter half of the twentieth century. Demand for copper products has fallen due to the dramatic increase in the price of copper, resulting in increased demand for alternative products including [[PEX]] and [[stainless steel]].\n\n==== Plastic ====\n{{Main|Plastic pipework}}\n[[File:SinkPlumbing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Plastic hot and cold supply piping for a sink]]\nPlastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) pipe. Principal types include:\n[[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when [[Waldo Semon]] of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) pipe. The method for producing [[cross-linked polyethylene]] (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.\n* [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]/[[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride|CPVC]] \u2013 rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it has become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's the difference between PVC and CPVC pipe?|url=http://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/resource-center/whats-the-difference-between-pvc-and-cpvc-pipe/|date=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Polypropylene|PP]] \u2013 The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|title=Polypropylene Properties and Uses|author=Bidisha Mukherjee|work=Buzzle|access-date=February 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208001734/http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water.

With the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] both water supply and sanitation stagnated\u2014or regressed\u2014for well over 1,000 years.  Improvement was very slow, with little effective progress made until the growth of modern densely populated cities in the 1800s. During this period, [[public health]] authorities began pressing for better waste disposal systems to be installed, to prevent or control [[epidemic]]s of disease. Earlier, the waste disposal system had consisted of collecting waste and dumping it on the ground or into a river. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems eliminated open sewage ditches and [[cesspit|cesspools]].\n\nMost large cities today pipe solid wastes to [[sewage treatment]] plants in order to separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, [[galvanized iron]] piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with flared fittings, then with rigid copper tubing utilizing soldered fittings.\n\nThe use of lead for potable water declined sharply after [[World War II]] because of increased awareness of the dangers of [[lead poisoning]]. At this time, copper piping was introduced as a better and safer alternative to lead pipes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Public Notice .Lead Contamination Informative City Ok Moscow Water System|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&dat=19880812&id=EZUrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AdEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3819,1428737|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 12, 1988}}</ref>\n\n== Systems ==\n[[File:Cu pipe leonard.jpg|thumb|[[Copper]] piping system in a building]]\nThe major categories of plumbing systems or subsystems are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Plumbing System|url=http://www.slideshare.net/haroldtaylor1113/10-basic-plumbing-system|accessdate=4 January 2016|date=January 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* potable cold and hot [[tap water]] supply\n* [[plumbing drainage venting]]\n* [[sewage system]]s and [[septic system]]s with or without [[hot water heat recycling]] and [[graywater]] recovery and treatment systems\n* Rainwater, surface, and subsurface water drainage\n* [[fuel gas]] piping\n* [[hydronics]], i.e. heating and cooling systems utilizing water to transport thermal energy, as in [[district heating]] systems, like for example the [[New York City steam system]].\n\n==Water pipes==\n{{distinguish|Hookah|Bong}}\n[[File:Waterpipes.jpeg|thumb|200px|A system of [[copper]] water [[Tubing (material)|tubes]] used in a [[radiator]] heating system.]]\n\nA ''water pipe'' is a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] or [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]], frequently made of plastic or metal,{{efn|Materials used to make water pipes are [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], [[ductile iron]], [[cast iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and formerly [[lead]].}} that carries [[Pressure|pressurized]] and [[Water purification|treated]] [[fresh water]] to a building (as part of a [[municipal water system]]), as well as inside the building.\n\n===History===\n{{Main|History of water supply and sanitation}}\n[[File:Canalisation machine de Marly.jpg|thumb|Old water pipe, remnant of the [[Machine de Marly]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], France]]\n\n[[Lead]] was the favoured material for water pipes for many centuries because its [[ductility|malleability]] made it practical to [[metalsmith|work]] into the desired shape.

This was a source of lead-related health problems in the years before the [[lead poisoning|health hazards of ingesting lead]] were fully understood; among these were [[stillbirth]]s and high rates of [[infant mortality]].

Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.

Note that the inner tube is actually transporting the water, while the outer tube only serves as a protective casing]]\n\nThe difference between pipes and tubes is a matter of sizing. For instance, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe for plumbing applications and galvanized steel pipe are measured in [[iron pipe size]] (IPS). Copper tube, [[CPVC]], [[PEX|PeX]] and other tubing is measured nominally, basically an average diameter. These sizing schemes allow for universal adaptation of transitional fittings. For instance, 1/2\" PeX tubing is the same size as 1/2\" copper tubing. 1/2\" PVC on the other hand is not the same size as 1/2\" tubing, and therefore requires either a threaded male or female adapter to connect them.  When used in agricultural irrigation, the singular form \"pipe\" is often used as a plural.<ref name=\"etb\">{{cite web|title=Difference between Pipes and Tubes|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pipes-tubes-d_347.html|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nPipe is available in rigid ''joints'', which come in various lengths depending on the material. Tubing, in particular copper, comes in rigid hard tempered joints or soft tempered (annealed) rolls. PeX and CPVC tubing also comes in rigid joints or flexible rolls. The temper of the copper, whether it is a rigid joint or flexible roll, does not affect the sizing.<ref name=\"etb\" />\n\nThe thicknesses of the water pipe and tube walls can vary. Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the [[Standard Dimension Ratio]] (SDR), defined as the ratio of the pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter).\n\nWall thickness does not affect pipe or tubing size.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wall thickness does not affect pipe o|url=http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903072809/http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|archivedate=September 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 1/2\" L copper has the same outer diameter as 1/2\" K or M copper. The same applies to pipe schedules. As a result, a slight increase in pressure losses is realized due to a decrease in flowpath as wall thickness is increased. In other words, 1 foot of 1/2\" L copper has slightly less volume than 1 foot of 1/2 M copper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Materials ===\nWater systems of ancient times relied on gravity for the supply of water, using pipes or channels usually made of [[clay]], [[lead]], bamboo, wood, or stone. Hollowed wooden logs wrapped in steel banding were used for plumbing pipes, particularly water mains. Logs were used for water distribution in England close to 500 years ago. US cities began using hollowed logs in the late 1700s through the 1800s.  Today, most plumbing supply pipe is made out of steel, copper, and plastic; most waste (also known as \"soil\")<ref name=cispi>http://www.cispi.org/products/types.aspx{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute</ref> out of steel, copper, plastic, and cast iron.<ref name=cispi />\n\nThe straight sections of plumbing systems are called \"pipes\" or \"tubes\". A pipe is typically formed via [[casting]] or [[welding]], whereas a tube is made through [[extrusion]]. Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as [[brazing]], [[compression fitting]], [[crimp (joining)|crimping]], or for plastics, [[solvent welding]].  These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the [[piping and plumbing fittings]] article.\n\n==== Steel ====\n{{Main|Galvanized pipe}}\n[[Galvanized steel]] potable water supply and distribution [[pipe (material)|pipes]] are commonly found with [[nominal pipe size]]s from {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} to {{convert|2|in|mm}}. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has [[National Pipe Thread]] (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, [[valve]]s, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as \"'''galv'''\" or \"'''iron'''\" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a [[pipe threader]]. It remains in common use for repair of existing \"galv\" systems and to satisfy [[building code]] non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse.  Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for [[fire sprinkler]]s and natural gas.\n\nMost typical single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than {{convert|3/4|in|mm}} due to expense as well as steel piping's tendency to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.\n\n==== Copper ====\n{{Main|Copper tubing}}\n\nCopper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the latter half of the twentieth century. Demand for copper products has fallen due to the dramatic increase in the price of copper, resulting in increased demand for alternative products including [[PEX]] and [[stainless steel]].\n\n==== Plastic ====\n{{Main|Plastic pipework}}\n[[File:SinkPlumbing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Plastic hot and cold supply piping for a sink]]\nPlastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) pipe. Principal types include:\n[[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when [[Waldo Semon]] of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) pipe. The method for producing [[cross-linked polyethylene]] (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.\n* [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]/[[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride|CPVC]] \u2013 rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it has become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's the difference between PVC and CPVC pipe?|url=http://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/resource-center/whats-the-difference-between-pvc-and-cpvc-pipe/|date=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Polypropylene|PP]] \u2013 The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|title=Polypropylene Properties and Uses|author=Bidisha Mukherjee|work=Buzzle|access-date=February 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208001734/http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water.

New tools have been developed to help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or other problems; they also use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.\n\nFlooding from excessive rain or clogged sewers may require specialized equipment, such as a heavy duty pumper truck designed to vacuum raw sewage.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Problems ==\nBacteria have been shown to live in \"premises plumbing systems\".

It stars [[Winona Ryder]], [[Ethan Hawke]] and Stiller, with supporting roles by [[Janeane Garofalo]] and [[Steve Zahn]]. The plot follows Lelaina (Ryder), an aspiring [[videography|videographer]] working on a documentary called ''Reality Bites'' about the disenfranchised lives of her friends and roommates. Their challenges exemplify some of the career and lifestyle choices faced by [[Generation&nbsp;X]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing $33.4 million worldwide against an $11.5 million budget. Critics highlighted the performances of Ryder, Hawke and Garofalo in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-02-18/entertainment/25860369_1_helen-childress-reality-bites-troy|title=A Generation X Quartet Sinks Its Teeth Into Life|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-10-17/entertainment/9910180191_1_lelaina-reality-bites-structure-of-reality|title='Reality' Is A Gen-x Film With Satirical Bite|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=October 17, 1999|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the years since the initial release of the film, it has achieved [[Cult film|cult status]] and has been singled out as one of the films that captured the zeitgeist of the early 1990s [[grunge]] scene among young adults, while also bringing attention to various issues that plagued young Americans at the time.\n\n==Plot==\nFour friends who recently graduated from college live together in Houston, Texas. Coffee-house guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings except for one brief, drunken encounter. Troy is floundering, having lost several minimum wage jobs\u2014the last of which he loses early in the film for stealing a candy bar from his employer. Lelaina was valedictorian of her university and has aspirations to become a documentarian, although initially having to settle for a position as production-assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.\n\nLelaina meets Michael Grates when she throws a cigarette into his [[convertible]], causing him to crash into her car. The two soon begin to date. He works at an [[MTV]]-like cable channel called \"In Your Face\" as an executive, and after learning about a documentary she's been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.\n\nLelaina's roommate Vickie has a series of [[one-night stand]]s and short relationships with dozens of guys; her promiscuity leads her to confront a very real risk of contracting [[HIV]] after a former fling tests positive for the virus. Vickie works as a sales associate for [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], and is later promoted to manager and seems content with her new job. Her friend Sammy Gray is gay; he remains [[Celibacy|celibate]], not because of a fear of AIDS, but because forming a relationship would force him to [[Coming out|come out]] to his conservative parents.\n\nAfter an impulsive act of retribution, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates. Eventually, Vickie's HIV test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Lelaina's relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that she feels compromises her artistic vision. Lelaina and Troy have a heart-to-heart which leads to them sleeping together and confess their love. The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town. After Troy's father dies, he forces himself to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.\n\nTroy and Lelaina reunite and make amends after Troy returns from his father's funeral in Chicago. While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, \"Elaina\" and \"Roy\", who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship. As the \"show's\" credits roll, Michael's name is revealed as the creator, implying that he has turned the relationship between Lelaina and Troy into the subject of a new show on his network.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Lelaina Pierce\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Troy Dyer\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Michael Grates\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Vickie Miner\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Sammy Gray\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Charlane McGregor\n* Harry O'Reilly as Wes McGregor\n* [[Barry Sherman]] as Grant's producer\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Louise\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Rock\n* [[Keith David]] as Roger\n* [[David Pirner]] as Phineas\n* [[Evan Dando]] as Actor \"Roy\"\n* [[Karen Duffy]] as Actor \"Elaina\"\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Tom Pierce\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Grant Gubler\n}}\n\nIn addition to Garofalo, director Stiller gave cameos to [[Andy Dick]] (as a sleazy boss) and [[John F.

Stiller also cast fellow [[Saturday Night Live cast members|''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus]] [[David Spade]] in an uncredited appearance as the manager during Lelaina's brief employment at [[Wienerschnitzel]]. Stiller's then-girlfriend [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] also makes an uncredited appearance, parodying [[Cindy Crawford]] and MTV's show ''[[House of Style]]''.

Coffee-house guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings except for one brief, drunken encounter. Troy is floundering, having lost several minimum wage jobs\u2014the last of which he loses early in the film for stealing a candy bar from his employer. Lelaina was valedictorian of her university and has aspirations to become a documentarian, although initially having to settle for a position as production-assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.\n\nLelaina meets Michael Grates when she throws a cigarette into his [[convertible]], causing him to crash into her car. The two soon begin to date. He works at an [[MTV]]-like cable channel called \"In Your Face\" as an executive, and after learning about a documentary she's been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.\n\nLelaina's roommate Vickie has a series of [[one-night stand]]s and short relationships with dozens of guys; her promiscuity leads her to confront a very real risk of contracting [[HIV]] after a former fling tests positive for the virus. Vickie works as a sales associate for [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], and is later promoted to manager and seems content with her new job. Her friend Sammy Gray is gay; he remains [[Celibacy|celibate]], not because of a fear of AIDS, but because forming a relationship would force him to [[Coming out|come out]] to his conservative parents.\n\nAfter an impulsive act of retribution, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates. Eventually, Vickie's HIV test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Lelaina's relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that she feels compromises her artistic vision. Lelaina and Troy have a heart-to-heart which leads to them sleeping together and confess their love. The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town. After Troy's father dies, he forces himself to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.\n\nTroy and Lelaina reunite and make amends after Troy returns from his father's funeral in Chicago. While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, \"Elaina\" and \"Roy\", who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship. As the \"show's\" credits roll, Michael's name is revealed as the creator, implying that he has turned the relationship between Lelaina and Troy into the subject of a new show on his network.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Lelaina Pierce\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Troy Dyer\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Michael Grates\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Vickie Miner\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Sammy Gray\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Charlane McGregor\n* Harry O'Reilly as Wes McGregor\n* [[Barry Sherman]] as Grant's producer\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Louise\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Rock\n* [[Keith David]] as Roger\n* [[David Pirner]] as Phineas\n* [[Evan Dando]] as Actor \"Roy\"\n* [[Karen Duffy]] as Actor \"Elaina\"\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Tom Pierce\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Grant Gubler\n}}\n\nIn addition to Garofalo, director Stiller gave cameos to [[Andy Dick]] (as a sleazy boss) and [[John F.

Romero and Birman along with Matt Manjourides and Justin Martell will produce the film. Birman was the second unit director on ''Land of the Dead'', ''Diary of the Dead'' and ''Survival of the Dead''. Birman pitched the idea to Romero ten years earlier, saying the movie is like ''[[The Road Warrior]]'' meets ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'' at a [[NASCAR]] race, with significant inspiration from ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and that \"the story is set on an island where zombie prisoners race cars in a modern-day Coliseum for the entertainment of wealthy humans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/07/george-a-romero-says-road-of-the-dead-is-the-fast-and-the-furious-with-zombies/|title=George A.

{"title_page": "Medical genetics", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Clinical genetics|the journal|Clinical Genetics (journal)}}\n{{For|a non-technical introduction to the topic|Introduction to genetics}}\n{{Genetics sidebar}}\n\n'''Medical genetics''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that involves the diagnosis and management of [[hereditary disorder]]s.  Medical genetics differs from [[human genetics]] in that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not apply to medicine, while medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to medical care.  For example, research on the causes and inheritance of [[genetic disorders]] would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics, while the diagnosis, management, and counselling people with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\n\nIn contrast, the study of typically non-medical [[phenotype]]s such as the genetics of eye color would be considered part of human genetics, but not necessarily relevant to medical genetics (except in situations such as [[albinism]]).  ''Genetic medicine'' is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as [[gene therapy]], [[personalized medicine]], and the rapidly emerging new medical specialty, [[predictive medicine]].\n\n== Scope ==\n'''Medical genetics''' encompasses many different areas, including clinical practice of physicians, genetic counselors, and nutritionists, clinical diagnostic laboratory activities, and research into the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders.  Examples of conditions that fall within the scope of medical genetics include [[birth defects]] and [[dysmorphology]], [[mental retardation]], [[autism]], [[mitochondrial]] disorders, [[skeletal dysplasia]], [[connective tissue disorder]]s, [[cancer]] genetics, [[teratogens]], and [[prenatal diagnosis]].  Medical genetics is increasingly becoming relevant to many common diseases.  Overlaps with other medical specialties are beginning to emerge, as recent advances in [[genetics]] are revealing etiologies for [[neurology|neurologic]], [[endocrinology|endocrine]], [[cardiology|cardiovascular]], [[pulmonology|pulmonary]], [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]], [[nephrology|renal]], [[psychiatry|psychiatric]], and [[dermatology|dermatologic]] conditions. The medical genetics community is increasingly involved with individuals who have undertaken [[elective genetic and genomic testing]].\n\n=== Subspecialties ===\nIn some ways, many of the individual fields within medical genetics are hybrids between clinical care and research.  This is due in part to recent advances in science and technology (for example, see the [[Human genome project]]) that have enabled an unprecedented understanding of [[genetic disorders]].\n\n==== Clinical genetics ====\nClinical genetics is the practice of clinical medicine with particular attention to [[hereditary disorder]]s.  Referrals are made to genetics clinics for a variety of reasons, including [[birth defects]], [[developmental delay]], [[autism]], [[epilepsy]], [[short stature]], and many others.  Examples of genetic syndromes that are commonly seen in the genetics clinic include [[chromosome abnormality|chromosomal rearrangements]], [[Down syndrome]], [[DiGeorge syndrome]] (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome), [[Fragile X syndrome]], [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Neurofibromatosis]], [[Turner syndrome]], and [[Williams syndrome]].\n\nIn the United States, Doctors who practice clinical genetics are accredited by the American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abmgg.org/|title=American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics|author=|date=|website=abmgg.org}}</ref> In order to become a board-certified practitioner of Clinical Genetics, a physician must complete a minimum of 24 months of training in a program accredited by the ABMGG. Individuals seeking acceptance into clinical genetics training programs must hold an M.D. or D.O. degree (or their equivalent) and have completed a minimum of 24 months of training in an [[ACGME]]-accredited [[residency (medicine)|residency]] program in [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], or other medical specialty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abmgg.org/pages/training_options.shtml|title=Training Options - ABMGG|author=|date=|website=abmgg.org}}</ref>\n\n==== Metabolic/biochemical genetics ====\nMetabolic (or biochemical) genetics involves the diagnosis and management of [[inborn errors of metabolism]] in which patients have enzymatic deficiencies that perturb [[biochemistry|biochemical]] pathways involved in metabolism of [[carbohydrates]], [[amino acids]], and [[lipids]].  Examples of metabolic disorders include [[galactosemia]], [[glycogen storage disease]], [[lysosomal storage disorder]]s, [[metabolic acidosis]], [[peroxisomal disorders]], [[phenylketonuria]], and [[urea cycle disorder]]s.\n\n==== Cytogenetics ====\nCytogenetics is the study of [[chromosomes]] and [[chromosome abnormalities]].  While cytogenetics historically relied on [[microscopy]] to analyze chromosomes, new molecular technologies such as [[array comparative genomic hybridization]] are now becoming widely used.  Examples of chromosome abnormalities include [[aneuploidy]], [[chromosome abnormality|chromosomal rearrangements]], and genomic deletion/duplication disorders.\n\n==== Molecular genetics ====\nMolecular genetics involves the discovery of and laboratory testing for [[DNA]] mutations that underlie many [[genetic disorders|single gene disorders]].  Examples of single gene disorders include [[achondroplasia]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], hereditary [[breast cancer]] (BRCA1/2), [[Huntington disease]], [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Noonan syndrome]], and [[Rett syndrome]].  Molecular tests are also used in the diagnosis of syndromes involving [[epigenetic]] abnormalities, such as [[Angelman syndrome]], [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]], [[Prader-willi syndrome]], and [[uniparental disomy]].\n\n==== Mitochondrial genetics ====\nMitochondrial genetics concerns the diagnosis and management of [[mitochondrial]] disorders, which have a molecular basis but often result in biochemical abnormalities due to deficient energy production.\n\nThere exists some overlap between medical genetic diagnostic laboratories and [[molecular pathology]].\n\n== Genetic counseling ==\nGenetic counseling is the process of providing information about genetic conditions, diagnostic testing, and risks in other family members, within the framework of nondirective counseling. [[Genetic counselor]]s are non-physician members of the medical genetics team who specialize in family risk assessment and counseling of patients regarding genetic disorders. The precise role of the genetic counselor varies somewhat depending on the disorder.\nWhen working alongside geneticists, genetic counselors normally specialize in pediatric genetics which focuses on developmental abnormalities present in newborns, infants or children. The major goal of pediatric counseling is attempting to explain the genetic basis behind the child's developmental concerns in a compassionate and articulated manner that allows the potentially distressed or frustrated parents to easily understand the information. As well, genetic counselors normally take a family pedigree, which summarizes the medical history of the patient's family. This then aids the clinical geneticist in the differential diagnosis process and help determine which further steps should be taken to help the patient. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Resta |first1=Robert |title=A new definition of genetic counseling: national society of genetic counselors' task force report |journal=Journal of Genetic Counseling |date=19 May 2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201383 |doi=10.1007/s10897-005-9014-3 |pmid=16761103 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough genetics has its roots back in the 19th century with the work of the Bohemian monk [[Gregor Mendel]] and other pioneering scientists, human genetics emerged later. It started to develop, albeit slowly, during the first half of the 20th century. Mendelian (single-gene) inheritance was studied in a number of important disorders such as albinism, [[brachydactyly]] (short fingers and toes), and [[hemophilia]]. Mathematical approaches were also devised and applied to human genetics. [[Population genetics]] was created.\n\nMedical genetics was a late developer, emerging largely after the close of [[World War II]]  (1945) when the [[eugenics]] movement had fallen into disrepute. The Nazi misuse of eugenics sounded its death knell. Shorn of eugenics, a scientific approach could be used and was applied to human and medical genetics. Medical genetics saw an increasingly rapid rise in the second half of the 20th century and continues in the 21st century.\n\n== Current practice ==\nThe clinical setting in which patients are evaluated determines the scope of practice, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions.  For the purposes of general discussion, the typical encounters between patients and genetic practitioners may involve:\n* Referral to an out-patient genetics clinic (pediatric, adult, or combined) or an in-hospital consultation, most often for diagnostic evaluation.\n* Specialty genetics clinics focusing on management of [[inborn errors of metabolism]], [[skeletal dysplasia]], or [[lysosomal storage diseases]].\n* Referral for counseling in a prenatal genetics clinic to discuss risks to the pregnancy ([[advanced maternal age]], teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for prenatal diagnosis (typically non-invasive prenatal screening, diagnostic amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling).\n* Multidisciplinary specialty clinics that include a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor (cancer genetics, cardiovascular genetics, craniofacial or cleft lip/palate, hearing loss clinics, muscular dystrophy/neurodegenerative disorder clinics).\n\n=== Diagnostic evaluation ===\nEach patient will undergo a diagnostic evaluation tailored to their own particular presenting signs and symptoms.  The geneticist will establish a [[differential diagnosis]] and recommend appropriate testing. These tests might evaluate for [[chromosomes|chromosomal]] disorders, [[inborn errors of metabolism]], or single gene disorders.\n\n==== Chromosome studies ====\nChromosome studies are used in the general genetics clinic to determine a cause for developmental delay/mental retardation, birth defects, dysmorphic features, and/or autism.  Chromosome analysis is also performed in the prenatal setting to determine whether a fetus is affected with aneuploidy or other chromosome rearrangements.  Finally, chromosome abnormalities are often detected in cancer samples.  A large number of different methods have been developed for chromosome analysis:\n* Chromosome analysis using a [[karyotype]] involves special stains that generate light and dark bands, allowing identification of each chromosome under a microscope.\n* [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) involves fluorescent labeling of probes that bind to specific DNA sequences, used for identifying aneuploidy, genomic deletions or duplications, characterizing chromosomal translocations and determining the origin of [[ring chromosome]]s.\n* Chromosome painting is a technique that uses fluorescent probes specific for each chromosome to differentially label each chromosome.  This technique is more often used in cancer cytogenetics, where complex chromosome rearrangements can occur.\n* [[Array comparative genomic hybridization]] is a newer molecular technique that involves hybridization of an individual DNA sample to a glass slide or microarray chip containing molecular probes (ranging from large ~200kb [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s to small oligonucleotides) that represent unique regions of the genome.  This method is particularly sensitive for detection of genomic gains or losses across the genome but does not detect balanced translocations or distinguish the location of duplicated genetic material (for example, a tandem duplication versus an insertional duplication).\n\n==== Basic metabolic studies ====\nBiochemical studies are performed to screen for imbalances of metabolites in the bodily fluid, usually the blood (plasma/serum) or urine, but also in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  Specific tests of enzyme function (either in leukocytes, skin fibroblasts, liver, or muscle) are also employed under certain circumstances.  In the US, the [[newborn screening|newborn screen]] incorporates biochemical tests to screen for treatable conditions such as [[galactosemia]] and [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU).  Patients suspected to have a metabolic condition might undergo the following tests:\n* Quantitative amino acid analysis is typically performed using the ninhydrin reaction, followed by [[liquid chromatography]] to measure the amount of amino acid in the sample (either urine, plasma/serum, or CSF).  Measurement of amino acids in plasma or serum is used in the evaluation of [[List of amino acid metabolism disorders|disorders of amino acid metabolism]] such as [[urea cycle disorders]], [[maple syrup urine disease]], and [[phenylketonuria|PKU]].  Measurement of amino acids in urine can be useful in the diagnosis of [[cystinuria]] or renal [[Fanconi syndrome]] as can be seen in [[cystinosis]].\n* Urine organic acid analysis can be either performed using quantitative or qualitative methods, but in either case the test is used to detect the excretion of abnormal [[organic aciduria|organic acids]].  These compounds are normally produced during bodily metabolism of amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids, but accumulate in patients with certain [[inborn error of metabolism|metabolic conditions]].\n* The acylcarnitine combination profile detects compounds such as organic acids and fatty acids conjugated to carnitine.  The test is used for detection of disorders involving fatty acid metabolism, including [[Medium chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency|MCAD]].\n* Pyruvate and lactate are byproducts of normal metabolism, particularly during [[Lactic acid fermentation|anaerobic metabolism]].  These compounds normally accumulate during exercise or ischemia, but are also elevated in patients with disorders of pyruvate metabolism or mitochondrial disorders.\n* [[Ammonia]] is an end product of amino acid metabolism and is converted in the liver to [[urea]] through a series of enzymatic reactions termed the [[urea cycle]].  Elevated ammonia can therefore be detected in patients with [[urea cycle disorders]], as well as other conditions involving [[liver failure]].\n* Enzyme testing is performed for a wide range of metabolic disorders to confirm a diagnosis suspected based on screening tests.\n\n==== Molecular studies ====\n* [[DNA sequencing]] is used to directly analyze the genomic DNA sequence of a particular gene.  In general, only the parts of the gene that code for the expressed protein ([[exons]]) and small amounts of the flanking untranslated regions and [[introns]] are analyzed.  Therefore, although these tests are highly specific and sensitive, they do not routinely identify all of the mutations that could cause disease.\n* [[DNA methylation]] analysis is used to diagnose certain genetic disorders that are caused by disruptions of [[epigenetic]] mechanisms such as [[genomic imprinting]] and [[uniparental disomy]].\n* [[Southern blotting]] is an early technique basic on detection of fragments of DNA separated by size through [[gel electrophoresis]] and detected using radiolabeled probes.  This test was routinely used to detect deletions or duplications in conditions such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] but is being replaced by high-resolution [[array comparative genomic hybridization]] techniques.  Southern blotting is still useful in the diagnosis of disorders caused by [[trinucleotide repeat]]s.\n\n=== Treatments ===\nEach cell of the body contains the hereditary information ([[DNA]]) wrapped up in structures called [[chromosomes]].  Since genetic syndromes are typically the result of alterations of the chromosomes or genes, there is no treatment currently available that can correct the genetic alterations in every cell of the body.  Therefore, there is currently no \"cure\" for genetic disorders.  However, for many genetic syndromes there is treatment available to manage the symptoms.  In some cases, particularly [[inborn errors of metabolism]], the mechanism of disease is well understood and offers the potential for dietary and medical management to prevent or reduce the long-term complications.  In other cases, [[infusion therapy]] is used to replace the missing enzyme.  Current research is actively seeking to use [[gene therapy]] or other new medications to treat specific genetic disorders.\n\n==== Management of metabolic disorders ====\nIn general, metabolic disorders arise from enzyme deficiencies that disrupt normal metabolic pathways.  For instance, in the hypothetical example:\n\n     A ---> B ---> C ---> D         AAAA ---> BBBBBB ---> CCCCCCCCCC ---> (no D)\n        X      Y      Z                   X           Y       |      (no or insufficient Z)\n                                                            EEEEE\n\nCompound \"A\" is metabolized to \"B\" by enzyme \"X\", compound \"B\" is metabolized to \"C\" by enzyme \"Y\", and compound \"C\" is metabolized to \"D\" by enzyme \"Z\".\nIf enzyme \"Z\" is missing, compound \"D\" will be missing, while compounds \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" will build up.  The pathogenesis of this particular condition could result from lack of compound \"D\", if it is critical for some cellular function, or from toxicity due to excess \"A\", \"B\", and/or \"C\", or from toxicity due to the excess of \"E\" which is normally only present in small amounts and only accumulates when \"C\" is in excess.  Treatment of the metabolic disorder could be achieved through dietary supplementation of compound \"D\" and dietary restriction of compounds \"A\", \"B\", and/or \"C\" or by treatment with a medication that promoted disposal of excess \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"E\".  Another approach that can be taken is enzyme replacement therapy, in which a patient is given an infusion of the missing enzyme \"Z\" or cofactor therapy to increase the efficacy of any residual \"Z\" activity.\n\n* Diet\nDietary restriction and supplementation are key measures taken in several well-known metabolic disorders, including [[galactosemia]], [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), [[maple syrup urine disease]], organic acidurias and [[urea cycle disorders]].  Such restrictive diets can be difficult for the patient and family to maintain, and require close consultation with a nutritionist who has special experience in metabolic disorders.  The composition of the diet will change depending on the caloric needs of the growing child and special attention is needed during a pregnancy if a woman is affected with one of these disorders.\n\n* Medication\nMedical approaches include enhancement of residual enzyme activity (in cases where the enzyme is made but is not functioning properly), inhibition of other enzymes in the biochemical pathway to prevent buildup of a toxic compound, or diversion of a toxic compound to another form that can be excreted.  Examples include the use of high doses of [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B6) in some patients with [[homocystinuria]] to boost the activity of the residual cystathione synthase enzyme, administration of [[biotin]] to restore activity of several enzymes affected by deficiency of [[biotinidase]], treatment with [[Nitisinone|NTBC]] in [[Tyrosinemia]] to inhibit the production of succinylacetone which causes liver toxicity, and the use of [[sodium benzoate]] to decrease [[ammonia]] build-up in [[urea cycle disorders]].\n\n* [[Enzyme replacement therapy]]\nCertain [[lysosomal storage diseases]] are treated with infusions of a recombinant enzyme (produced in a laboratory), which can reduce the accumulation of the compounds in various tissues.  Examples include  [[Gaucher disease]], [[Fabry disease]], [[Mucopolysaccharidoses]] and [[Pompe's disease|Glycogen storage disease type II]].  Such treatments are limited by the ability of the enzyme to reach the affected areas (the [[blood brain barrier]] prevents enzyme from reaching the brain, for example), and can sometimes be associated with allergic reactions.  The long-term clinical effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapies vary widely among different disorders.\n\n==== Other examples ====\n* Angiotensin receptor blockers in Marfan syndrome & Loeys-Dietz\n* Bone marrow transplantation\n* Gene therapy\n\n== Career paths and training ==xxc\n\n\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2015}}\n[[File:ScientistPedigree.JPG|thumb|Geneticist working with a pedigree]]There are a variety of career paths within the field of medical genetics, and naturally the training required for each area differs considerably.

Medical genetics differs from [[human genetics]] in that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not apply to medicine, while medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to medical care.  For example, research on the causes and inheritance of [[genetic disorders]] would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics, while the diagnosis, management, and counselling people with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\n\nIn contrast, the study of typically non-medical [[phenotype]]s such as the genetics of eye color would be considered part of human genetics, but not necessarily relevant to medical genetics (except in situations such as [[albinism]]).  ''Genetic medicine'' is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as [[gene therapy]], [[personalized medicine]], and the rapidly emerging new medical specialty, [[predictive medicine]].\n\n== Scope ==\n'''Medical genetics''' encompasses many different areas, including clinical practice of physicians, genetic counselors, and nutritionists, clinical diagnostic laboratory activities, and research into the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders.  Examples of conditions that fall within the scope of medical genetics include [[birth defects]] and [[dysmorphology]], [[mental retardation]], [[autism]], [[mitochondrial]] disorders, [[skeletal dysplasia]], [[connective tissue disorder]]s, [[cancer]] genetics, [[teratogens]], and [[prenatal diagnosis]].  Medical genetics is increasingly becoming relevant to many common diseases.  Overlaps with other medical specialties are beginning to emerge, as recent advances in [[genetics]] are revealing etiologies for [[neurology|neurologic]], [[endocrinology|endocrine]], [[cardiology|cardiovascular]], [[pulmonology|pulmonary]], [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]], [[nephrology|renal]], [[psychiatry|psychiatric]], and [[dermatology|dermatologic]] conditions. The medical genetics community is increasingly involved with individuals who have undertaken [[elective genetic and genomic testing]].\n\n=== Subspecialties ===\nIn some ways, many of the individual fields within medical genetics are hybrids between clinical care and research.  This is due in part to recent advances in science and technology (for example, see the [[Human genome project]]) that have enabled an unprecedented understanding of [[genetic disorders]].\n\n==== Clinical genetics ====\nClinical genetics is the practice of clinical medicine with particular attention to [[hereditary disorder]]s.  Referrals are made to genetics clinics for a variety of reasons, including [[birth defects]], [[developmental delay]], [[autism]], [[epilepsy]], [[short stature]], and many others.  Examples of genetic syndromes that are commonly seen in the genetics clinic include [[chromosome abnormality|chromosomal rearrangements]], [[Down syndrome]], [[DiGeorge syndrome]] (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome), [[Fragile X syndrome]], [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Neurofibromatosis]], [[Turner syndrome]], and [[Williams syndrome]].\n\nIn the United States, Doctors who practice clinical genetics are accredited by the American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abmgg.org/|title=American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics|author=|date=|website=abmgg.org}}</ref> In order to become a board-certified practitioner of Clinical Genetics, a physician must complete a minimum of 24 months of training in a program accredited by the ABMGG. Individuals seeking acceptance into clinical genetics training programs must hold an M.D. or D.O. degree (or their equivalent) and have completed a minimum of 24 months of training in an [[ACGME]]-accredited [[residency (medicine)|residency]] program in [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], or other medical specialty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abmgg.org/pages/training_options.shtml|title=Training Options - ABMGG|author=|date=|website=abmgg.org}}</ref>\n\n==== Metabolic/biochemical genetics ====\nMetabolic (or biochemical) genetics involves the diagnosis and management of [[inborn errors of metabolism]] in which patients have enzymatic deficiencies that perturb [[biochemistry|biochemical]] pathways involved in metabolism of [[carbohydrates]], [[amino acids]], and [[lipids]].  Examples of metabolic disorders include [[galactosemia]], [[glycogen storage disease]], [[lysosomal storage disorder]]s, [[metabolic acidosis]], [[peroxisomal disorders]], [[phenylketonuria]], and [[urea cycle disorder]]s.\n\n==== Cytogenetics ====\nCytogenetics is the study of [[chromosomes]] and [[chromosome abnormalities]].  While cytogenetics historically relied on [[microscopy]] to analyze chromosomes, new molecular technologies such as [[array comparative genomic hybridization]] are now becoming widely used.  Examples of chromosome abnormalities include [[aneuploidy]], [[chromosome abnormality|chromosomal rearrangements]], and genomic deletion/duplication disorders.\n\n==== Molecular genetics ====\nMolecular genetics involves the discovery of and laboratory testing for [[DNA]] mutations that underlie many [[genetic disorders|single gene disorders]].  Examples of single gene disorders include [[achondroplasia]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], hereditary [[breast cancer]] (BRCA1/2), [[Huntington disease]], [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Noonan syndrome]], and [[Rett syndrome]].  Molecular tests are also used in the diagnosis of syndromes involving [[epigenetic]] abnormalities, such as [[Angelman syndrome]], [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]], [[Prader-willi syndrome]], and [[uniparental disomy]].\n\n==== Mitochondrial genetics ====\nMitochondrial genetics concerns the diagnosis and management of [[mitochondrial]] disorders, which have a molecular basis but often result in biochemical abnormalities due to deficient energy production.\n\nThere exists some overlap between medical genetic diagnostic laboratories and [[molecular pathology]].\n\n== Genetic counseling ==\nGenetic counseling is the process of providing information about genetic conditions, diagnostic testing, and risks in other family members, within the framework of nondirective counseling. [[Genetic counselor]]s are non-physician members of the medical genetics team who specialize in family risk assessment and counseling of patients regarding genetic disorders. The precise role of the genetic counselor varies somewhat depending on the disorder.\nWhen working alongside geneticists, genetic counselors normally specialize in pediatric genetics which focuses on developmental abnormalities present in newborns, infants or children. The major goal of pediatric counseling is attempting to explain the genetic basis behind the child's developmental concerns in a compassionate and articulated manner that allows the potentially distressed or frustrated parents to easily understand the information. As well, genetic counselors normally take a family pedigree, which summarizes the medical history of the patient's family. This then aids the clinical geneticist in the differential diagnosis process and help determine which further steps should be taken to help the patient. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Resta |first1=Robert |title=A new definition of genetic counseling: national society of genetic counselors' task force report |journal=Journal of Genetic Counseling |date=19 May 2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201383 |doi=10.1007/s10897-005-9014-3 |pmid=16761103 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough genetics has its roots back in the 19th century with the work of the Bohemian monk [[Gregor Mendel]] and other pioneering scientists, human genetics emerged later. It started to develop, albeit slowly, during the first half of the 20th century. Mendelian (single-gene) inheritance was studied in a number of important disorders such as albinism, [[brachydactyly]] (short fingers and toes), and [[hemophilia]]. Mathematical approaches were also devised and applied to human genetics. [[Population genetics]] was created.\n\nMedical genetics was a late developer, emerging largely after the close of [[World War II]]  (1945) when the [[eugenics]] movement had fallen into disrepute. The Nazi misuse of eugenics sounded its death knell. Shorn of eugenics, a scientific approach could be used and was applied to human and medical genetics. Medical genetics saw an increasingly rapid rise in the second half of the 20th century and continues in the 21st century.\n\n== Current practice ==\nThe clinical setting in which patients are evaluated determines the scope of practice, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions.  For the purposes of general discussion, the typical encounters between patients and genetic practitioners may involve:\n* Referral to an out-patient genetics clinic (pediatric, adult, or combined) or an in-hospital consultation, most often for diagnostic evaluation.\n* Specialty genetics clinics focusing on management of [[inborn errors of metabolism]], [[skeletal dysplasia]], or [[lysosomal storage diseases]].\n* Referral for counseling in a prenatal genetics clinic to discuss risks to the pregnancy ([[advanced maternal age]], teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for prenatal diagnosis (typically non-invasive prenatal screening, diagnostic amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling).\n* Multidisciplinary specialty clinics that include a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor (cancer genetics, cardiovascular genetics, craniofacial or cleft lip/palate, hearing loss clinics, muscular dystrophy/neurodegenerative disorder clinics).\n\n=== Diagnostic evaluation ===\nEach patient will undergo a diagnostic evaluation tailored to their own particular presenting signs and symptoms.  The geneticist will establish a [[differential diagnosis]] and recommend appropriate testing. These tests might evaluate for [[chromosomes|chromosomal]] disorders, [[inborn errors of metabolism]], or single gene disorders.\n\n==== Chromosome studies ====\nChromosome studies are used in the general genetics clinic to determine a cause for developmental delay/mental retardation, birth defects, dysmorphic features, and/or autism.  Chromosome analysis is also performed in the prenatal setting to determine whether a fetus is affected with aneuploidy or other chromosome rearrangements.  Finally, chromosome abnormalities are often detected in cancer samples.  A large number of different methods have been developed for chromosome analysis:\n* Chromosome analysis using a [[karyotype]] involves special stains that generate light and dark bands, allowing identification of each chromosome under a microscope.\n* [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) involves fluorescent labeling of probes that bind to specific DNA sequences, used for identifying aneuploidy, genomic deletions or duplications, characterizing chromosomal translocations and determining the origin of [[ring chromosome]]s.\n* Chromosome painting is a technique that uses fluorescent probes specific for each chromosome to differentially label each chromosome.  This technique is more often used in cancer cytogenetics, where complex chromosome rearrangements can occur.\n* [[Array comparative genomic hybridization]] is a newer molecular technique that involves hybridization of an individual DNA sample to a glass slide or microarray chip containing molecular probes (ranging from large ~200kb [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s to small oligonucleotides) that represent unique regions of the genome.  This method is particularly sensitive for detection of genomic gains or losses across the genome but does not detect balanced translocations or distinguish the location of duplicated genetic material (for example, a tandem duplication versus an insertional duplication).\n\n==== Basic metabolic studies ====\nBiochemical studies are performed to screen for imbalances of metabolites in the bodily fluid, usually the blood (plasma/serum) or urine, but also in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  Specific tests of enzyme function (either in leukocytes, skin fibroblasts, liver, or muscle) are also employed under certain circumstances.  In the US, the [[newborn screening|newborn screen]] incorporates biochemical tests to screen for treatable conditions such as [[galactosemia]] and [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU).  Patients suspected to have a metabolic condition might undergo the following tests:\n* Quantitative amino acid analysis is typically performed using the ninhydrin reaction, followed by [[liquid chromatography]] to measure the amount of amino acid in the sample (either urine, plasma/serum, or CSF).  Measurement of amino acids in plasma or serum is used in the evaluation of [[List of amino acid metabolism disorders|disorders of amino acid metabolism]] such as [[urea cycle disorders]], [[maple syrup urine disease]], and [[phenylketonuria|PKU]].  Measurement of amino acids in urine can be useful in the diagnosis of [[cystinuria]] or renal [[Fanconi syndrome]] as can be seen in [[cystinosis]].\n* Urine organic acid analysis can be either performed using quantitative or qualitative methods, but in either case the test is used to detect the excretion of abnormal [[organic aciduria|organic acids]].  These compounds are normally produced during bodily metabolism of amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids, but accumulate in patients with certain [[inborn error of metabolism|metabolic conditions]].\n* The acylcarnitine combination profile detects compounds such as organic acids and fatty acids conjugated to carnitine.  The test is used for detection of disorders involving fatty acid metabolism, including [[Medium chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency|MCAD]].\n* Pyruvate and lactate are byproducts of normal metabolism, particularly during [[Lactic acid fermentation|anaerobic metabolism]].  These compounds normally accumulate during exercise or ischemia, but are also elevated in patients with disorders of pyruvate metabolism or mitochondrial disorders.\n* [[Ammonia]] is an end product of amino acid metabolism and is converted in the liver to [[urea]] through a series of enzymatic reactions termed the [[urea cycle]].  Elevated ammonia can therefore be detected in patients with [[urea cycle disorders]], as well as other conditions involving [[liver failure]].\n* Enzyme testing is performed for a wide range of metabolic disorders to confirm a diagnosis suspected based on screening tests.\n\n==== Molecular studies ====\n* [[DNA sequencing]] is used to directly analyze the genomic DNA sequence of a particular gene.  In general, only the parts of the gene that code for the expressed protein ([[exons]]) and small amounts of the flanking untranslated regions and [[introns]] are analyzed.  Therefore, although these tests are highly specific and sensitive, they do not routinely identify all of the mutations that could cause disease.\n* [[DNA methylation]] analysis is used to diagnose certain genetic disorders that are caused by disruptions of [[epigenetic]] mechanisms such as [[genomic imprinting]] and [[uniparental disomy]].\n* [[Southern blotting]] is an early technique basic on detection of fragments of DNA separated by size through [[gel electrophoresis]] and detected using radiolabeled probes.  This test was routinely used to detect deletions or duplications in conditions such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] but is being replaced by high-resolution [[array comparative genomic hybridization]] techniques.  Southern blotting is still useful in the diagnosis of disorders caused by [[trinucleotide repeat]]s.\n\n=== Treatments ===\nEach cell of the body contains the hereditary information ([[DNA]]) wrapped up in structures called [[chromosomes]].  Since genetic syndromes are typically the result of alterations of the chromosomes or genes, there is no treatment currently available that can correct the genetic alterations in every cell of the body.  Therefore, there is currently no \"cure\" for genetic disorders.  However, for many genetic syndromes there is treatment available to manage the symptoms.  In some cases, particularly [[inborn errors of metabolism]], the mechanism of disease is well understood and offers the potential for dietary and medical management to prevent or reduce the long-term complications.  In other cases, [[infusion therapy]] is used to replace the missing enzyme.  Current research is actively seeking to use [[gene therapy]] or other new medications to treat specific genetic disorders.\n\n==== Management of metabolic disorders ====\nIn general, metabolic disorders arise from enzyme deficiencies that disrupt normal metabolic pathways.  For instance, in the hypothetical example:\n\n     A ---> B ---> C ---> D         AAAA ---> BBBBBB ---> CCCCCCCCCC ---> (no D)\n        X      Y      Z                   X           Y       |      (no or insufficient Z)\n                                                            EEEEE\n\nCompound \"A\" is metabolized to \"B\" by enzyme \"X\", compound \"B\" is metabolized to \"C\" by enzyme \"Y\", and compound \"C\" is metabolized to \"D\" by enzyme \"Z\".\nIf enzyme \"Z\" is missing, compound \"D\" will be missing, while compounds \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" will build up.  The pathogenesis of this particular condition could result from lack of compound \"D\", if it is critical for some cellular function, or from toxicity due to excess \"A\", \"B\", and/or \"C\", or from toxicity due to the excess of \"E\" which is normally only present in small amounts and only accumulates when \"C\" is in excess.  Treatment of the metabolic disorder could be achieved through dietary supplementation of compound \"D\" and dietary restriction of compounds \"A\", \"B\", and/or \"C\" or by treatment with a medication that promoted disposal of excess \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"E\".  Another approach that can be taken is enzyme replacement therapy, in which a patient is given an infusion of the missing enzyme \"Z\" or cofactor therapy to increase the efficacy of any residual \"Z\" activity.\n\n* Diet\nDietary restriction and supplementation are key measures taken in several well-known metabolic disorders, including [[galactosemia]], [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), [[maple syrup urine disease]], organic acidurias and [[urea cycle disorders]].  Such restrictive diets can be difficult for the patient and family to maintain, and require close consultation with a nutritionist who has special experience in metabolic disorders.  The composition of the diet will change depending on the caloric needs of the growing child and special attention is needed during a pregnancy if a woman is affected with one of these disorders.\n\n* Medication\nMedical approaches include enhancement of residual enzyme activity (in cases where the enzyme is made but is not functioning properly), inhibition of other enzymes in the biochemical pathway to prevent buildup of a toxic compound, or diversion of a toxic compound to another form that can be excreted.  Examples include the use of high doses of [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B6) in some patients with [[homocystinuria]] to boost the activity of the residual cystathione synthase enzyme, administration of [[biotin]] to restore activity of several enzymes affected by deficiency of [[biotinidase]], treatment with [[Nitisinone|NTBC]] in [[Tyrosinemia]] to inhibit the production of succinylacetone which causes liver toxicity, and the use of [[sodium benzoate]] to decrease [[ammonia]] build-up in [[urea cycle disorders]].\n\n* [[Enzyme replacement therapy]]\nCertain [[lysosomal storage diseases]] are treated with infusions of a recombinant enzyme (produced in a laboratory), which can reduce the accumulation of the compounds in various tissues.  Examples include  [[Gaucher disease]], [[Fabry disease]], [[Mucopolysaccharidoses]] and [[Pompe's disease|Glycogen storage disease type II]].  Such treatments are limited by the ability of the enzyme to reach the affected areas (the [[blood brain barrier]] prevents enzyme from reaching the brain, for example), and can sometimes be associated with allergic reactions.  The long-term clinical effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapies vary widely among different disorders.\n\n==== Other examples ====\n* Angiotensin receptor blockers in Marfan syndrome & Loeys-Dietz\n* Bone marrow transplantation\n* Gene therapy\n\n== Career paths and training ==\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2015}}\n[[File:ScientistPedigree.JPG|thumb|Geneticist working with a pedigree]]There are a variety of career paths within the field of medical genetics, and naturally the training required for each area differs considerably.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]].

At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

it.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=51}} Migot states that it is significant that \u015a\u0101riputra has a continuity in Mahayana texts, as most of the Buddha's great disciples are usually absent from Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=537}} Migot credits the importance of \u015a\u0101riputra in the early ''Vatsiputriya'' Buddhist school with why \u015a\u0101riputra often appeared in Mahayana texts.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=538}}\n\nIn the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalak\u012brti S\u016btra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is depicted as being unable to grasp [[Mahayana]] doctrines such as [[Nondualism|non-duality]] and [[Emptiness (Buddhism)|emptiness]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} In the sutra, a goddess listening to [[Vimalakirti|Vimalak\u012brti]] scatters flowers which fall onto \u015a\u0101riputra's robes.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} Not wanting to break the monastic rules, which forbid decorating oneself with flowers, he tries to remove them but is unable to.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} The goddess then accuses \u015a\u0101riputra of being attached to the duality of what is proper and improper.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} Later in the sutra, \u015a\u0101riputra asks that if the goddess is so spiritually advanced, why doesn't she transform out of her female state, indicative of cultural sexism.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} The goddess responds by using her powers to switch bodies with \u015a\u0101riputra to demonstrate that male and female is just an illusion because, according to Mahayana doctrine, all things are empty and so male and female don't really exist.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}\n\nIn the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'', \u015a\u0101riputra is portrayed as being unable to understand the ultimate meaning of ''[[prajnaparamita]]'' and instead must be instructed by the disciple [[Subh\u016bti]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} According to Buddhist scholar [[Edward Conze]], the sutra depicts \u015a\u0101riputra as being preoccupied with dualities, making him unable to grasp the true meaning of ''prajnaparamita''.{{sfn|Conze|1983|p=5}} In the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=17,25,28,29}} Conze states that \u015a\u0101riputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, ''prajnaparamita'' doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=56}} The ''[[Da zhidu lun]]'' commentary to the sutra describes \u015a\u0101riputra as someone who pursued the [[bodhisattva]] path in a past life but gave up and turned to the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka]]'' path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}[[File:Lotus Sutra (Chokokan).jpg|thumb|Japanese depiction of the Lotus Sutra, where \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the Buddha to preach.|alt=|left]]\u015a\u0101riputra plays a major role in the [[Heart Sutra]], where the teaching is directed at him. \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana bodhisattva [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] how to practice [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom]].{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=52}} Avalokite\u015bvara's response to \u015a\u0101riputra, then makes up the body of the sutra.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=49}} When Avalokite\u015bvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and \u015a\u0101riputra, Avalokite\u015bvara, and the audience then rejoice.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=121}} In the [[Saddharmapundarika|Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of [[buddhas]] and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: [[Up\u0101ya|''up\u0101ya'']]) to teach the Dharma, which leaves the arhats in the assembly confused.{{sfn|Lopez|2016|p=12-13}} \u015a\u0101riputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the ''Lotus Sutra''.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=38}}  Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that \u015a\u0101riputra had followed the [[bodhisattva]] path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the ''\u015ar\u0101vaka'' path in this life.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=46}} The Buddha then assures \u015a\u0101riputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that \u015a\u0101riputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=47}} In the listing of the great arhats in the assembly at the beginning of the [[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], \u015a\u0101riputra is mentioned as the fifteenth of the great arhats, while in the [[Shorter Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]] he is placed as the first.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=491}}\n\n== Relics ==\n{{Main|Relics of Sariputta and Moggallana}}\n[[File:003 Front View (33709016166).jpg|thumb|One of the [[Sanchi]] stupas, where relics of \u015a\u0101riputra were excavated.]]\nAccording to accounts from 7th century Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]], \u015a\u0101riputra's as well as Maudgaly\u0101yana's relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by King [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports have confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the [[Sanchi Stupa|stupas]] in the city of [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], with \u015a\u0101riputra's and Maudgaly\u0101yana's names inscribed on them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} \u015a\u0101riputra's casket contained pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was part of \u015a\u0101riputra's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at st\u016bpas in the nearby town of [[Satdh\u0101ra]] found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have redistributed the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. The British government conceded and transferred the relics to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India before being enshrined in Sanchi in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister [[Nehru]] agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:BACC - Bangkok - 2017-11-02 (008).jpg|thumb|Image of the Buddha with his chief disciples at [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]]. \u015a\u0101riputra is traditionally depicted on the right side of the Buddha while Maudgaly\u0101yana is traditionally depicted on the left.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} |alt=]]\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the [[Theravada]] tradition. According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]].

At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

true meaning of ''prajnaparamita''.{{sfn|Conze|1983|p=5}} In the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=17,25,28,29}} Conze states that \u015a\u0101riputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, ''prajnaparamita'' doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=56}} The ''[[Da zhidu lun]]'' commentary to the sutra describes \u015a\u0101riputra as someone who pursued the [[bodhisattva]] path in a past life but gave up and turned to the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka]]'' path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}[[File:Lotus Sutra (Chokokan).jpg|thumb|Japanese depiction of the Lotus Sutra, where \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the Buddha to preach.|alt=|left]]\u015a\u0101riputra plays a major role in the [[Heart Sutra]], where the teaching is directed at him. \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana bodhisattva [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] how to practice [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom]].{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=52}} Avalokite\u015bvara's response to \u015a\u0101riputra, then makes up the body of the sutra.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=49}} When Avalokite\u015bvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and \u015a\u0101riputra, Avalokite\u015bvara, and the audience then rejoice.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=121}} In the [[Saddharmapundarika|Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of [[buddhas]] and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: [[Up\u0101ya|''up\u0101ya'']]) to teach the Dharma, which leaves the arhats in the assembly confused.{{sfn|Lopez|2016|p=12-13}} \u015a\u0101riputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the ''Lotus Sutra''.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=38}}  Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that \u015a\u0101riputra had followed the [[bodhisattva]] path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the ''\u015ar\u0101vaka'' path in this life.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=46}} The Buddha then assures \u015a\u0101riputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that \u015a\u0101riputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=47}} In the listing of the great arhats in the assembly at the beginning of the [[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], \u015a\u0101riputra is mentioned as the fifteenth of the great arhats, while in the [[Shorter Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]] he is placed as the first.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=491}}\n\n== Relics ==\n{{Main|Relics of Sariputta and Moggallana}}\n[[File:003 Front View (33709016166).jpg|thumb|One of the [[Sanchi]] stupas, where relics of \u015a\u0101riputra were excavated.]]\nAccording to accounts from 7th century Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]], \u015a\u0101riputra's as well as Maudgaly\u0101yana's relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by King [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports have confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the [[Sanchi Stupa|stupas]] in the city of [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], with \u015a\u0101riputra's and Maudgaly\u0101yana's names inscribed on them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} \u015a\u0101riputra's casket contained pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was part of \u015a\u0101riputra's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at st\u016bpas in the nearby town of [[Satdh\u0101ra]] found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have redistributed the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. The British government conceded and transferred the relics to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India before being enshrined in Sanchi in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister [[Nehru]] agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:BACC - Bangkok - 2017-11-02 (008).jpg|thumb|Image of the Buddha with his chief disciples at [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]]. \u015a\u0101riputra is traditionally depicted on the right side of the Buddha while Maudgaly\u0101yana is traditionally depicted on the left.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} |alt=]]\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the [[Theravada]] tradition. According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.
