Munawar Hasan joined the [[National Students Federation]], a student group, and was elected its president in 1959. The real change appeared in his life when he came closer to the activists of [[Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba]] Pakistan and studied the writings of [[Abul Ala Maududi|Mawlana Syed Abul Ala Maududi]] and Maulana [[Naeem Siddiqui]]. As a result, he joined Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba in 1960 and was elected president of its [[University of Karachi]] unit, Karachi City Unit, and a member of its Central Executive Council. He became its national president in 1964 and served in that capacity for three consecutive terms.

He became its secretary general in 1969. Under his supervision, the academy published 70 scholarly books. He also served as managing editor of ''The Criterion'' and ''The Universal Message'', [[Karachi]].\n\nMunawar Hasan became a member of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jama'at-e-Islami Pakistan]] in 1967. He served the Karachi unit as Assistant Secretary, Secretary, Deputy Ameer and Ameer of the city. He was then elected to the Central Shura and the Executive Council of the Jama'at. He represented the group at several platforms, including [[United Democratic Front (Pakistan)|United Democratic Front]] and the [[Pakistan National Alliance]] formed by many Pakistani political parties. He ran for the seat of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] in 1977 and secured the highest vote tally in Pakistan.

The war began when the French and Spanish armies [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invaded and occupied Portugal]] in 1807, and escalated in 1808 after [[Napoleonic France]] took over Spain, previously its ally, and installed [[Joseph Bonaparte]] on the Spanish throne. The war on the peninsula lasted until the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] defeated Napoleon in 1814, and is regarded as one of the first [[wars of national liberation]], significant for the emergence of large-scale [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nThe Peninsular War overlaps with what the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]] calls the ''Guerra de la Independencia Espa\u00f1ola'' ('''Spanish War of Independence'''), which began with the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]] on 2 May 1808 and ended on 17 April 1814. The French occupation destroyed the [[Government of Spain|Spanish administration]], which fragmented into quarrelling [[Junta (Peninsular War)|provincial ''juntas'']]. The episode remains one of the bloodiest events in Spain's history.\n\nA reconstituted national government, the [[Cortes of C\u00e1diz]]\u2014in effect a [[government-in-exile]]\u2014fortified itself in [[C\u00e1diz]] in 1810, but could not raise effective armies because it was [[Siege of C\u00e1diz|besieged]] by 70,000 French troops. British and Portuguese forces eventually secured Portugal, using it as a safe position from which to launch campaigns against the French army and provide whatever supplies they could get to the Spanish, while the Spanish armies and guerrillas tied down vast numbers of Napoleon's troops.{{efn|By 1813, Spanish guerrillas tied down over 75% of the French occupying army, leaving only a small fraction free to concentrate and face the conventional allied forces under Wellington.{{harv|Fraser|2008|p=365}}}} These combined regular and irregular allied forces, by restricting French control of territory, prevented Napoleon's [[Marshal of France#French Empire|marshals]] from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces, and the war continued through years of stalemate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=David |title=The Art of Warfare on Land |page=164}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2014|needs date of publication, publisher etc}}</ref>\n\nThe [[British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|British Army]], under then Lt.

In the following year Wellington scored a decisive victory over King [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s army in the [[Battle of Vitoria]]. Pursued by the armies of Britain, Spain and Portugal, Marshal [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult]], no longer able to get sufficient support from a depleted France, led the exhausted and demoralized French forces in a fighting withdrawal across the [[Pyrenees]] during the winter of 1813\u20131814.\n\nThe years of fighting in Spain were a heavy burden on France's [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]. While the French were victorious in battle, their communications and supplies were severely tested and their units were frequently isolated, harassed or overwhelmed by partisans fighting an intense guerrilla war of raids and ambushes. The Spanish armies were repeatedly beaten and driven to the peripheries, but they would regroup and relentlessly hound the French. This drain on French resources led Napoleon, who had unwittingly provoked a [[total war]], to call the conflict the \"Spanish Ulcer\".{{sfn|Hindley|2010}}<ref>{{harv|Ellis|2014|p=100}} cites Owen Connelly (ed), \"peninsular War\", ''Historical dictionary'', p. 387.</ref>\n\nWar and revolution against Napoleon's occupation led to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], later a cornerstone of European liberalism.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=432\u2013433}} The burden of war destroyed the social and economic fabric of Portugal and Spain, and ushered in an era of social turbulence, political instability and economic stagnation.

The Emperor sent orders on 19 July 1807 to his Foreign Minister, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], to order Portugal to declare war on Britain, close its ports to British ships, detain British subjects on a provisional basis and sequester their goods. After a few days, a large force started concentrating at [[Bayonne]].<ref>Chandler (1966), 597.</ref> Meanwhile, the Portuguese government's resolve was stiffening, and shortly afterward Napoleon was once again told that Portugal would not go beyond its original agreements. Napoleon now had all the pretext that he needed, while his force, the First Corps of Observation of the Gironde with [[divisional general]] [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] in command, was prepared to march on Lisbon.

Townsfolk and peasants all over the country, who had been forced to bury family members in new municipal cemeteries, took back their bodies at night and tried to restore them to their old resting-places. In [[Madrid]], the growing numbers of ''[[afrancesado|''afrancesados'']]'' (Francophiles) at court were opposed by the ''majos'': shopkeepers, artisans, taverners and labourers who dressed in traditional style, and took pleasure in picking fights with ''petimetres'', the young class who styled themselves with French fashion and manners.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=22}}\n\nSpain was an ally of Napoleon's First French Empire; however, defeat at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in October 1805 had removed the reason for alliance with France. Godoy\u2014who was a favourite of King [[Charles IV of Spain]]\u2014began to seek some form of escape. At the start of the War of the Fourth Coalition, which pitted the Kingdom of Prussia against Napoleon, Godoy issued a proclamation that was obviously aimed at France, even though it did not specify an enemy. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt]], Godoy quickly withdrew the proclamation. However, it was too late to avert the Emperor's suspicions. Napoleon planned from that moment to deal with his inconstant ally at some future time. In the meantime, the Emperor dragooned Godoy and Charles IV into providing a division of Spanish troops to serve in northern Europe.<ref>Gates (2002), 6\u20137.</ref> The [[Division of the North]] spent the winter of 1807\u20131808 in [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Mecklenburg]] and towns of the old [[Hanseatic League]].

Wellesley withdrew from Talavera on 4 August to avoid being cut off by Soult's converging army, which defeated a Spanish blocking force in an assault crossing at the River Tagus near [[Battle of Arzobispo|Puente del Arzobispo]]. Lack of supplies and the threat of French reinforcement in the spring led Wellington to retreat into Portugal.

Kellermann marched on Del Parque's position at Salamanca, who promptly abandoned it and retreated south. In the meantime, the guerrillas in the [[Province of Le\u00f3n]] increased their activity.

After much preparation and debate, on 2 July 1809 Spain was divided into 38 new provinces, each headed by an [[Intendent]] appointed by King Joseph, and on 17 April 1810 these provinces were converted into French-style [[prefecture]]s and [[sub-prefecture]]s.\n\nThe French obtained a measure of acquiescence among the propertied classes. [[Francisco de Goya]], who remained in Madrid throughout the French occupation, painted Joseph's picture and documented the war in a series of 82 prints called ''[[The Disasters of War|Los Desastres de la Guerra]]'' (''The Disasters of War''). For many imperial officers, life could be comfortable.{{sf|Brandt|1999|p=87}} Among the liberal, republican and radical segments of the Spanish and Portuguese populations there was much support for a potential French invasion. The term ''[[afrancesado]]'' (\"turned French\") was used to denote those who supported the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Secularism|secular ideals]], and the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|McLynn|1997|pp=396\u2013406}} Napoleon relied on support from these ''afrancesados'' both in the conduct of the war and administration of the country. Napoleon removed all feudal and clerical privileges but most Spanish liberals soon came to oppose the occupation because of the violence and brutality it brought.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|pp=396\u2013406}} Marxians wrote that there was a positive identification on the part of the people with the Napoleonic revolution, but this is probably impossible to substantiate by the reasons for collaboration being practical rather than ideological.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=239}}\n\n===Emergence of the guerrilla===\n[[File:Juan Mart\u00edn D\u00edez.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Mart\u00edn D\u00edez]], ''El Empecinado'', a key guerrilla leader]]\n\nThe Peninsular War is regarded as one of the first people's wars, significant for the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare.

Later in the war the authorities tried to make the guerrillas reliable, and many of them formed regular army units such as [[Francisco Espoz y Mina|Espoz y Mina]]'s \"Cazadores de Navarra\". The French believed that [[enlightened absolutism]] had made less progress in Spain and Portugal than elsewhere, and that resistance was the product of a century's worth of what the French perceived as backwardness in knowledge and social habits, Catholic [[obscurantism]], superstition and counter-revolution.{{sfn|Rocca|Rocca|1815|p={{page needed|date=September 2015}} }}\n\nThe guerrilla style of fighting was the Spanish military's single most effective tactic. Most organized attempts by regular Spanish forces to take on the French ended in defeat. Once a battle was lost and the soldiers reverted to their guerrilla roles, they tied down large numbers of French troops over a wide area with a much lower expenditure of men, energy, and supplies{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and facilitated the conventional victories of Wellington and his Anglo-Portuguese army and the subsequent liberation of Portugal and Spain.{{sfn|Glover|2001|p=10}} Mass resistance by the people of Spain inspired the war efforts of Austria, Russia and Prussia against Napoleon.{{sfn|Chandler|1995|p=746}}\n\nHatred of the French and devotion to ''[[dios, rey y patria|God, King and Fatherland]]'' were not the only reason to join the Partisans.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=270}} The French imposed restrictions on movement and on many traditional aspects of street life, so opportunities to find alternative sources of income were limited{{mdash}}industry was at a standstill and many ''se\u00f1ores'' were unable to pay their existing retainers and domestic servants, and could not take on new staff. Hunger and despair reigned on all sides.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=271}} Because the military record was so dismal, many Spanish politicians and publicists exaggerated the activities of the guerrillas.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=280}}\n\n===Revolution under siege===\n{{details|Siege of C\u00e1diz}}\n[[File:SitiodeCadiz.jpg|thumb|Map of C\u00e1diz in 1813]]\nThe French invaded Andalusia on 19 January 1810. 60,000 French troops{{mdash}}the corps of Victor, Mortier and Sebastiani together with other formations{{mdash}}advanced southwards to assault the Spanish positions.

[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Cueva, 14th Duke of Alburquerque|Alburquerque's]] army and the Voluntarios Distinguidos had been reinforced by 3,000 soldiers who had fled Seville, and a strong Anglo-Portuguese brigade commanded by General William Stewart. Shaken by their experiences, the Spaniards had abandoned their earlier scruples about a British garrison.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=282}} Victor's French troops camped at the shoreline and tried to bombard the city into surrender. Thanks to British naval supremacy, a naval blockade of the city was impossible. The French bombardment was ineffectual and the confidence of the ''[[gaditanos]]'' grew and persuaded them that they were heroes. With food abundant and falling in price, the bombardment was hopeless despite both hurricane and epidemic{{mdash}}a storm destroyed many ships in the spring of 1810 and the city was ravaged by yellow fever.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=283}}\n\nOnce C\u00e1diz was secured, attention turned to the political situation. The Junta Central announced that the ''cortes'' would open on 1 March 1810. Suffrage was to be extended to all male householders over 25. After public voting, representatives from district-level assemblies would choose deputies to send to the provincial meetings that would be the bodies from which the members of the ''cortes'' would emerge.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=284}} From 1 February 1810, the implementation of these decrees had been in the hands of the new regency council selected by the Junta Central.{{sfn|Arg\u00fcelles|1970|p=90}} The viceroyalties and independent captaincies general of the overseas territories would each send one representative. This scheme was resented in America for providing unequal representation to the overseas territories. Unrest erupted in [[Quito]] and [[Sucre|Charcas]], which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms and resented being subsumed in the larger \"kingdom\" of [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]]. The revolts were suppressed (See [[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]] and [[Bolivian War of Independence]]).

To further hamper the enemy, the areas in front of the lines were subjected to a [[scorched earth]] policy: they were denuded of food, forage and shelter. 200,000 inhabitants of neighbouring districts were relocated inside the lines.

Unable to resist the oncoming Russians, the French had to evacuate [[East Prussia]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw]]. With both the [[Austrian Empire]] and the Kingdom of Prussia joining his opponents, Napoleon withdrew more troops from Spain,{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=428}} including some foreign units and three battalions of sailors sent to assist with the Siege of C\u00e1diz. In total, 20,000 men were withdrawn; the numbers were not overwhelming, but the occupying forces were left in a difficult position. In much of the area under French control\u2014the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] provinces, [[Navarre]], Aragon, Old Castile, [[La Mancha]], the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]], and parts of [[Catalonia]] and [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]]\u2014the remaining presence was a few scattered garrisons. Trying to hold a front line in an arc from [[Bilbao]] to Valencia, they were still vulnerable to assault, and had abandoned hopes of victory. According to Esdaile, the best policy would have been to have fallen back to the Ebro, but the political situation in 1813 made this impossible; Napoleon wanted to avoid being seen as weak by the German princes, who were watching the advancing Russians and wondering whether they should change sides.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=429}} French prestige suffered another blow when on 17 March ''el rey intruso'' (the ''Intrusive King'', a nickname many Spanish had for King Joseph) left Madrid in the company of another vast caravan of refugees.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=429}}\n\nIn 1813, Wellington marched 121,000 troops (53,749 British, 39,608 Spanish, and 27,569 Portuguese){{sfn|Gates|2002|p=521}} from northern Portugal across the mountains of northern Spain and the Esla River, skirting Jourdan's army of 68,000 strung out between the Douro and the Tagus. Wellington shortened his communications by shifting his base of operations to the northern Spanish coast, and the Anglo-Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos, outflanking the French army and forcing Joseph Bonaparte into the Zadorra valley.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vitoria]] on 21 June, Joseph's 65,000-man army were defeated decisively by Wellington's army of 57,000 British, 16,000 Portuguese and 8,000 Spanish.{{sfn|Gates|2002|p=521}} Wellington split his army into four attacking \"columns\" and attacked the French defensive position from south, west and north while the last column cut down across the French rear. The French were forced back from their prepared positions, and despite attempts to regroup and hold were driven into a rout. This led to the abandonment of all of the French artillery as well as King Joseph's extensive baggage train and personal belongings. The latter led to many Anglo-Allied soldiers abandoning the pursuit of the fleeing troops, to instead loot the wagons. This delay, along with the French managing to hold the east road out of Vitoria towards Salvatierra, allowed the French to partially recover. The Allies chased the retreating French, reaching the Pyrenees in early July, and began operations against [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] and [[Pamplona]]. On 11 July, Soult was given command of all French troops in Spain and in consequence Wellington decided to halt his army to regroup at the Pyrenees.\n\nThe war was not over. Although Bonapartist Spain had effectively collapsed, most of France's troops had retreated in order and fresh troops were soon gathering beyond the Pyrenees. By themselves, such forces were unlikely to score more than a few local victories, but French troop losses elsewhere in Europe could not be taken for granted. Napoleon might yet inflict defeats on Austria, Russia and Prussia, and with the divisions between the allies there was no guarantee that one power would not make a separate peace. It was a major victory and gave Britain more credibility on the continent, but the thought of Napoleon descending on the Pyrenees with the ''grande arm\u00e9e'' was not regarded with equanimity.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=454}}\n\n===End of the war in Spain===\n====Campaign in the eastern Atlantic region====\nIn August 1813, British headquarters still had misgivings about the eastern powers moving into France. Austria had now joined the Allies, but the Allied armies had suffered a significant defeat at the [[Battle of Dresden]]. They had recovered somewhat, but the situation was still precarious.

Sickness was widespread\u2014at one point a third of Wellington's British troops were ''[[hors de combat]]''\u2014and fears about the army's discipline and general reliability grew. By 9 July, Wellington reported that 12,500 men were absent without leave, while plundering was rife. Major General Sir [[Frederick Philipse Robinson|Frederick Robinson]] wrote, \"We paint the conduct of the French in this country in very&nbsp;...&nbsp;harsh colours, but be assured we injure the people much more than they do&nbsp;...&nbsp;Wherever we move devastation marks our steps\".{{sfn|Robinson|1956|p=165}} With the army poised on the borders of France, desertion had become a problem.

Wellington wrote, \"The desertion is terrible, and is unaccountable among the British troops.

This reduced Suchet's French Catalonian army from 87,000 to 60,000 of whom 10,000 were on garrison duty. By the end of January through redeployment and wastage (through disease and desertion) the number had fallen to 52,000 of whom only 28,000 were available for field operations; the others were either on garrison duties or guarding the lines of communication back into France.{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=308\u2013311, 402}}\n\nSuchet thought that the armies under the command of the Spanish General [[Francisco Copons y Navia|Copons]] and the British General [[Henry Clinton (Napoleonic Wars)|Clinton]] amounted to 70,000 men (in fact they only had about as many as he did), so Suchet remained on the defensive.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=406}}\n\nOn 10 January 1814 Suchet received orders from the French War Ministry that he withdraw his field force to the foothills of the Pyrenees and to make a phased withdraw from the outlying garrisons.

Suchet had not yet started the process of sending more men back to France and was able to stop the Sicilians (and a small contingent of British artillery in support) at the [[Battle of Molins de Rey (1814)|Battle of Molins de Rey]] because he still had a local preponderance of men. The allies suffered 68 casualties; the French, 30 killed and about 150 wounded.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=411}}\n\nAfter Suchet sent many men to Lyons, he left an isolated garrison in Barcelona and concentrated his forces on the town of Gerona calling in [[flying column]]s and evacuating some minor outposts. However his field army was now down to 15,000 cavalry and infantry (and excluding the garrisons in northern Catalonia).{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=415}}\n\nThe last actions in this theatre happened at the [[Siege of Barcelona (1808)|siege of Barcelona]] on 23 February; the French sallied out of Barcelona to test the besiegers' lines, as they thought (wrongly) that the Anglo-Sicilian forces had departed. They failed to break through the lines, and forces under the command of the Spanish General [[Pedro Sarsfield]] stopped them. The French General [[Pierre-Joseph Habert]] tried another sortie on 16 April (several days after Napoleon had abdicated) and the French were again stopped with about 300 of them killed.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=431}} Habert eventually surrendered on 25 April.{{sfn|Gates|2002|p=459}}\n\nOn 1 March Suchet received orders to send 10,000 more men to Lyons. On 7 March Beurmann's division of 9,661 men left for Lyons. With the exception of [[Figueras]], Suchet abandoned all the remaining fortresses in Catalonia that the French garrisoned (and that were not closely besieged by Allied forces), and in doing so was able to create a new field force of about 14,000 men, which were concentrated in front of Figueras in early April.{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=424\u2013425, 431}}{{efn|There were a further 13,000 French troops besieged in Barcelona, Tortosa, Saguntun and other fortresses, who were under siege and not able to extract themselves to join Suchet at Figueras {{harv|Oman|1930|p=425}}.}}\n\nIn the meantime, because the Allies underestimated the size of Suchet's force and believed that 3,000 more men had left for Lyon and that Suchet, with the remnant of his army, was crossing the Pyrenees to join Soult in the Atlantic theatre, the Allies began to redeploy their forces. The best of the British forces in Catalonia were ordered to join Wellington's army on the river [[Garonne]] in France.{{efn|The Anglo-Italian battalions, the Calabrians and the Sicilian \"Estero\" regiment were sent to Sicily {{harv|Oman|1930|p=429}}.}} They left to do so on 31 March, leaving the Spanish to mop up the remaining French garrisons in Catalonia.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=431}}\n\nIn fact, Suchet remained in Figueras with his army until after the amnesty signed by Wellington and Soult. He spent his time arguing with Soult that he had only 4,000 troops available to march (although his army numbered around 14,000) and that they could not march with artillery, so he could not assist Soult in his battles with Wellington.{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=431\u2013432}} The military historian Sir Charles Oman puts this refusal to help Soult down to Suchet's personal animosity rather than strong strategic reasons.{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=432, 500}}\n\n==Invasion of France==\n{{main|Campaign in south-west France (1814)}}\n{{See also |Campaign in north-east France (1814)}}\n\n===Battles of the Nivelle and the Nive, November\u2013December 1813===\n[[File:Bataille de la Nivelle.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Nivelle]]\n\nOn the night of 9 November 1813 Wellington brought up his right from the Pyrenean passes to the northward of [[Maya, Baztan|Maya]] and towards the [[Nivelle (river)|Nivelle]].

The French officer going his rounds on the other side of the brook then turned up, and explained that he had caught his sentry, without arms and carrying two bottles, a long way to the rear.

The Portuguese and Spanish authorities were neglecting the payment and supply of their troops. Wellington had also difficulties of a similar kind with his own government, and also the Spanish soldiers, in revenge for many French outrages, had become guilty of grave excesses in France, so that Wellington took the extreme step of sending 25,000 of them back to Spain and resigning the command of their army (though his resignation was subsequently withdrawn). So great was the tension at this crisis that a rupture with Spain seemed possible, but this did not happen.{{sfn|Robinson|1911|p=96}}{{efn|On 11 December, Napoleon, beleaguered and desperate, agreed to a separate peace with Spain under the [[Treaty of Valen\u00e7ay]], under which he would release and recognize Ferdinand in exchange for a complete cessation of hostilities.

The war began when the French and Spanish armies [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invaded and occupied Portugal]] in 1807, and escalated in 1808 after [[Napoleonic France]] took over Spain, previously its ally, and installed [[Joseph Bonaparte]] on the Spanish throne. The war on the peninsula lasted until the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] defeated Napoleon in 1814, and is regarded as one of the first [[wars of national liberation]], significant for the emergence of large-scale [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nThe Peninsular War overlaps with what the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]] calls the ''Guerra de la Independencia Espa\u00f1ola'' ('''Spanish War of Independence'''), which began with the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]] on 2 May 1808 and ended on 17 April 1814.

After Napoleon's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt]], Godoy quickly withdrew the proclamation. However, it was too late to avert the Emperor's suspicions. Napoleon planned from that moment to deal with his inconstant ally at some future time.

Wellesley withdrew from Talavera on 4 August to avoid being cut off by Soult's converging army, which defeated a Spanish blocking force in an assault crossing at the River Tagus near [[Battle of Arzobispo|Puente del Arzobispo]]. Lack of supplies and the threat of French reinforcement in the spring led Wellington to retreat into Portugal.

The Junta came up with what it hoped would be a war-winning strategy, a two-pronged offensive to recapture Madrid, involving over 100,000 troops in three armies under the [[Vicente Ca\u00f1as y Portocarrero|Duke del Parque]], [[Juan Carlos de Ar\u00e9izaga]] and the [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Cueva, 14th Duke of Alburquerque|Duke of Alburquerque]].{{sfn|Gates|2002|p=94}}{{sfn|Gates|2002|pp=194\u2013196}}{{sfn|Gates|2002|p=494}} Del Parque defeated [[Jean Gabriel Marchand]]'s [[VI Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|VI Corps]] at the [[Battle of Tamames]] on 18 October 1809.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1998|pp=333\u2013334|ps=: This source listed Ballesteros' division in the Spanish order of battle.}}</ref> and occupied Salamanca on 25 October.{{sfn|Gates|2002|pp=197\u2013199}} Marchand was replaced by [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Kellermann]], who brought up reinforcements in the form of his own men as well as General of Brigade [[Nicolas Godinot]]'s force. Kellermann marched on Del Parque's position at Salamanca, who promptly abandoned it and retreated south. In the meantime, the guerrillas in the [[Province of Le\u00f3n]] increased their activity.

After much preparation and debate, on 2 July 1809 Spain was divided into 38 new provinces, each headed by an [[Intendent]] appointed by King Joseph, and on 17 April 1810 these provinces were converted into French-style [[prefecture]]s and [[sub-prefecture]]s.\n\nThe French obtained a measure of acquiescence among the propertied classes. [[Francisco de Goya]], who remained in Madrid throughout the French occupation, painted Joseph's picture and documented the war in a series of 82 prints called ''[[The Disasters of War|Los Desastres de la Guerra]]'' (''The Disasters of War''). For many imperial officers, life could be comfortable.{{sf|Brandt|1999|p=87}} Among the liberal, republican and radical segments of the Spanish and Portuguese populations there was much support for a potential French invasion. The term ''[[afrancesado]]'' (\"turned French\") was used to denote those who supported the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Secularism|secular ideals]], and the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|McLynn|1997|pp=396\u2013406}} Napoleon relied on support from these ''afrancesados'' both in the conduct of the war and administration of the country. Napoleon removed all feudal and clerical privileges but most Spanish liberals soon came to oppose the occupation because of the violence and brutality it brought.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|pp=396\u2013406}} Marxians wrote that there was a positive identification on the part of the people with the Napoleonic revolution, but this is probably impossible to substantiate by the reasons for collaboration being practical rather than ideological.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=239}}\n\n===Emergence of the guerrilla===\n[[File:Juan Mart\u00edn D\u00edez.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Mart\u00edn D\u00edez]], ''El Empecinado'', a key guerrilla leader]]\n\nThe Peninsular War is regarded as one of the first people's wars, significant for the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare.

Later in the war the authorities tried to make the guerrillas reliable, and many of them formed regular army units such as [[Francisco Espoz y Mina|Espoz y Mina]]'s \"Cazadores de Navarra\". The French believed that [[enlightened absolutism]] had made less progress in Spain and Portugal than elsewhere, and that resistance was the product of a century's worth of what the French perceived as backwardness in knowledge and social habits, Catholic [[obscurantism]], superstition and counter-revolution.{{sfn|Rocca|Rocca|1815|p={{page needed|date=September 2015}} }}\n\nThe guerrilla style of fighting was the Spanish military's single most effective tactic. Most organized attempts by regular Spanish forces to take on the French ended in defeat. Once a battle was lost and the soldiers reverted to their guerrilla roles, they tied down large numbers of French troops over a wide area with a much lower expenditure of men, energy, and supplies{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and facilitated the conventional victories of Wellington and his Anglo-Portuguese army and the subsequent liberation of Portugal and Spain.{{sfn|Glover|2001|p=10}} Mass resistance by the people of Spain inspired the war efforts of Austria, Russia and Prussia against Napoleon.{{sfn|Chandler|1995|p=746}}\n\nHatred of the French and devotion to ''[[dios, rey y patria|God, King and Fatherland]]'' were not the only reason to join the Partisans.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=270}} The French imposed restrictions on movement and on many traditional aspects of street life, so opportunities to find alternative sources of income were limited{{mdash}}industry was at a standstill and many ''se\u00f1ores'' were unable to pay their existing retainers and domestic servants, and could not take on new staff. Hunger and despair reigned on all sides.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=271}} Because the military record was so dismal, many Spanish politicians and publicists exaggerated the activities of the guerrillas.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=280}}\n\n===Revolution under siege===\n{{details|Siege of C\u00e1diz}}\n[[File:SitiodeCadiz.jpg|thumb|Map of C\u00e1diz in 1813]]\nThe French invaded Andalusia on 19 January 1810. 60,000 French troops{{mdash}}the corps of Victor, Mortier and Sebastiani together with other formations{{mdash}}advanced southwards to assault the Spanish positions.

[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Cueva, 14th Duke of Alburquerque|Alburquerque's]] army and the Voluntarios Distinguidos had been reinforced by 3,000 soldiers who had fled Seville, and a strong Anglo-Portuguese brigade commanded by General William Stewart. Shaken by their experiences, the Spaniards had abandoned their earlier scruples about a British garrison.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=282}} Victor's French troops camped at the shoreline and tried to bombard the city into surrender. Thanks to British naval supremacy, a naval blockade of the city was impossible. The French bombardment was ineffectual and the confidence of the ''[[gaditanos]]'' grew and persuaded them that they were heroes. With food abundant and falling in price, the bombardment was hopeless despite both hurricane and epidemic{{mdash}}a storm destroyed many ships in the spring of 1810 and the city was ravaged by yellow fever.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=283}}\n\nOnce C\u00e1diz was secured, attention turned to the political situation. The Junta Central announced that the ''cortes'' would open on 1 March 1810. Suffrage was to be extended to all male householders over 25. After public voting, representatives from district-level assemblies would choose deputies to send to the provincial meetings that would be the bodies from which the members of the ''cortes'' would emerge.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=284}} From 1 February 1810, the implementation of these decrees had been in the hands of the new regency council selected by the Junta Central.{{sfn|Arg\u00fcelles|1970|p=90}} The viceroyalties and independent captaincies general of the overseas territories would each send one representative. This scheme was resented in America for providing unequal representation to the overseas territories. Unrest erupted in [[Quito]] and [[Sucre|Charcas]], which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms and resented being subsumed in the larger \"kingdom\" of [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]]. The revolts were suppressed (See [[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]] and [[Bolivian War of Independence]]). Throughout early 1809 the governments of the capitals of the viceroyalties and captaincies general elected representatives to the Junta, but none arrived in time to serve on it.\n\n===Third Portuguese campaign===\n{{details|Lines of Torres Vedras}}\n[[File:Battle of Chiclana.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Battle of Chiclana]], 5th March 1811'' (1824) captures the fight between British redcoats and the French troops for Barrosa Ridge.{{sfn|Hindley|2010}}]]\n\nConvinced by intelligence that a new French assault on Portugal was imminent, Wellington created a powerful defensive position near Lisbon, to which he could fall back if necessary.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=217}}<ref>Grehan, John.

To further hamper the enemy, the areas in front of the lines were subjected to a [[scorched earth]] policy: they were denuded of food, forage and shelter. 200,000 inhabitants of neighbouring districts were relocated inside the lines. Wellington exploited the facts that the French could conquer Portugal only by conquering Lisbon, and that they could in practice reach Lisbon only from the north.

The French [[Army of Catalonia]] under MacDonald [[Siege of Figueras (1811)|blockaded]] the city to starve the defenders into surrender. With the help of a relief operation on 3 May, the fortress held out until 17 August, when lack of food prompted a surrender after a last-ditch breakout attempt failed.{{sfn|Rousset|1892|p=21}}\n\nOn 5 May, Suchet besieged the vital city of [[Tarragona]], which functioned as a port, a fortress, and a resource base that sustained the Spanish field forces in Catalonia. Suchet was given a third of the Army of Catalonia and the city fell to a surprise attack on 29 June.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=360}} Suchet's troops massacred 2,000 civilians. Napoleon rewarded Suchet with a Marshal's baton. On 25 July, Suchet [[Battle of Montserrat|drove]] the Spanish out of their positions on the [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] mountain range. In October, the Spanish launched a [[Battle of Cervera (1811)|counterattack]] that recaptured Montserrat and took 1,000 prisoners from scattered French garrisons in the area. In September, Suchet launched an invasion of the province of Valencia. He besieged the castle of [[Sagunto]] and [[Battle of Saguntum|defeated]] Blake's relief attempt. The Spanish defenders capitulated on 25 October. Suchet [[Siege of Valencia (1812)|trapped]] Blake's entire army of 28,044 men in the city of Valencia on 26 December and forced it to surrender on 9 January 1812 after a brief siege. Blake lost 20,281 men dead or captured. Suchet advanced south, capturing the port town of [[D\u00e9nia]]. The redeployment of a substantial part of his troops for the invasion of Russia ground Suchet's operations to a halt. The victorious Marshal had established a secure base in Aragon and was ennobled by Napoleon as the Duke of Albufera, after a [[lagoon]] south of Valencia.\n\nThe war now fell into a temporary lull, with the superior French unable to find an advantage and coming under increasing pressure from Spanish guerrillas. The French had over 350,000 soldiers in ''L'Arm\u00e9e de l'Espagne'', but over 200,000 were deployed to protect the French lines of supply, rather than as substantial fighting units.\n\n==1812==\n===Allied campaign in Spain===\n[[File:Battle of Badajoz.jpg|thumb|British infantry attempt to scale the walls of [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz]], 1812]]\n[[File:Battle of Salamanca.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Salamanca]]]]\n[[File:Cortes de cadiz.jpg|thumb|''The Proclamation of the Constitution of 1812'' by [[Salvador Viniegra]]]]\n\n[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] renewed the allied advance into Spain in early 1812, besieging and capturing the border fortress town of [[Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1812)|Ciudad Rodrigo]] by assault on 19 January and opening up the northern invasion corridor from Portugal into Spain.

Unable to resist the oncoming Russians, the French had to evacuate [[East Prussia]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Warsaw]]. With both the [[Austrian Empire]] and the Kingdom of Prussia joining his opponents, Napoleon withdrew more troops from Spain,{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=428}} including some foreign units and three battalions of sailors sent to assist with the Siege of C\u00e1diz. In total, 20,000 men were withdrawn; the numbers were not overwhelming, but the occupying forces were left in a difficult position. In much of the area under French control\u2014the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] provinces, [[Navarre]], Aragon, Old Castile, [[La Mancha]], the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]], and parts of [[Catalonia]] and [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]]\u2014the remaining presence was a few scattered garrisons. Trying to hold a front line in an arc from [[Bilbao]] to Valencia, they were still vulnerable to assault, and had abandoned hopes of victory. According to Esdaile, the best policy would have been to have fallen back to the Ebro, but the political situation in 1813 made this impossible; Napoleon wanted to avoid being seen as weak by the German princes, who were watching the advancing Russians and wondering whether they should change sides.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=429}} French prestige suffered another blow when on 17 March ''el rey intruso'' (the ''Intrusive King'', a nickname many Spanish had for King Joseph) left Madrid in the company of another vast caravan of refugees.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=429}}\n\nIn 1813, Wellington marched 121,000 troops (53,749 British, 39,608 Spanish, and 27,569 Portuguese){{sfn|Gates|2002|p=521}} from northern Portugal across the mountains of northern Spain and the Esla River, skirting Jourdan's army of 68,000 strung out between the Douro and the Tagus. Wellington shortened his communications by shifting his base of operations to the northern Spanish coast, and the Anglo-Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos, outflanking the French army and forcing Joseph Bonaparte into the Zadorra valley.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vitoria]] on 21 June, Joseph's 65,000-man army were defeated decisively by Wellington's army of 57,000 British, 16,000 Portuguese and 8,000 Spanish.{{sfn|Gates|2002|p=521}} Wellington split his army into four attacking \"columns\" and attacked the French defensive position from south, west and north while the last column cut down across the French rear. The French were forced back from their prepared positions, and despite attempts to regroup and hold were driven into a rout. This led to the abandonment of all of the French artillery as well as King Joseph's extensive baggage train and personal belongings. The latter led to many Anglo-Allied soldiers abandoning the pursuit of the fleeing troops, to instead loot the wagons. This delay, along with the French managing to hold the east road out of Vitoria towards Salvatierra, allowed the French to partially recover. The Allies chased the retreating French, reaching the Pyrenees in early July, and began operations against [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] and [[Pamplona]]. On 11 July, Soult was given command of all French troops in Spain and in consequence Wellington decided to halt his army to regroup at the Pyrenees.\n\nThe war was not over. Although Bonapartist Spain had effectively collapsed, most of France's troops had retreated in order and fresh troops were soon gathering beyond the Pyrenees. By themselves, such forces were unlikely to score more than a few local victories, but French troop losses elsewhere in Europe could not be taken for granted. Napoleon might yet inflict defeats on Austria, Russia and Prussia, and with the divisions between the allies there was no guarantee that one power would not make a separate peace. It was a major victory and gave Britain more credibility on the continent, but the thought of Napoleon descending on the Pyrenees with the ''grande arm\u00e9e'' was not regarded with equanimity.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=454}}\n\n===End of the war in Spain===\n====Campaign in the eastern Atlantic region====\nIn August 1813, British headquarters still had misgivings about the eastern powers moving into France. Austria had now joined the Allies, but the Allied armies had suffered a significant defeat at the [[Battle of Dresden]]. They had recovered somewhat, but the situation was still precarious. Wellington's brother-in-law [[Edward Pakenham]] wrote, \"I should think that much must depend upon proceedings in the north: I begin to apprehend&nbsp;...&nbsp;that Boney may avail himself of the jealousy of the Allies to the material injury of the cause.\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Edward Michael |last1=Pakenham |first2=Thomas |last2=Pakenham Longford |title=Pakenham Letters: 1800\u20131815 |publisher=Ken Trotman Publishing |year=2009 |page=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pakenham_Letters.html?id=WSEEfAEACAAJ|isbn=9781905074969 }}</ref> But the defeat or defection of Austria, Russia and Prussia was not the only danger. It was also uncertain that Wellington could continue to count on Spanish support.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=455}}\n\nThe summer of 1813 in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] provinces and [[Navarre]] was a wet one, with the army drenched by incessant rain, and the decision to strip the men of their greatcoats was looking unwise. Sickness was widespread\u2014at one point a third of Wellington's British troops were ''[[hors de combat]]''\u2014and fears about the army's discipline and general reliability grew. By 9 July, Wellington reported that 12,500 men were absent without leave, while plundering was rife. Major General Sir [[Frederick Philipse Robinson|Frederick Robinson]] wrote, \"We paint the conduct of the French in this country in very&nbsp;...&nbsp;harsh colours, but be assured we injure the people much more than they do&nbsp;...&nbsp;Wherever we move devastation marks our steps\".{{sfn|Robinson|1956|p=165}} With the army poised on the borders of France, desertion had become a problem. The [[Chasseurs Britanniques]]\u2014recruited mainly from French deserters\u2014lost 150 men in a single night. Wellington wrote, \"The desertion is terrible, and is unaccountable among the British troops. I am not astonished that the foreigners should go&nbsp;...&nbsp;but, unless they entice away the British soldiers, there is no accounting for their going away in such numbers as they do.\"<ref>Wellington to Bathurst, 18 August 1813, WD, vol.

Suchet, after the [[Battle of Vitoria]], evacuated Tarragona (17 August) but defeated Bentinck in the [[battle of Ordal]] (13 September).{{sfn|Robinson|1911|p=96}}\n\nThe military historian Sir [[Charles Oman]] wrote that because of \"[Napoleon's]<!--not a broken link but replacement of \"the Emperor\"--> absurdly optimistic reliance on\" the [[Treaty of Valen\u00e7ay]] (11 December 1813),{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=310}} during the last month of 1813 and the early months of 1814 Suchet was ordered by the French War office to relinquish command of many of his infantry and cavalry regiments for use in the [[campaign in north-east France (1814)|campaign in north-east France]] where Napoleon was greatly outnumbered. This reduced Suchet's French Catalonian army from 87,000 to 60,000 of whom 10,000 were on garrison duty. By the end of January through redeployment and wastage (through disease and desertion) the number had fallen to 52,000 of whom only 28,000 were available for field operations; the others were either on garrison duties or guarding the lines of communication back into France.{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=308\u2013311, 402}}\n\nSuchet thought that the armies under the command of the Spanish General [[Francisco Copons y Navia|Copons]] and the British General [[Henry Clinton (Napoleonic Wars)|Clinton]] amounted to 70,000 men (in fact they only had about as many as he did), so Suchet remained on the defensive.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=406}}\n\nOn 10 January 1814 Suchet received orders from the French War Ministry that he withdraw his field force to the foothills of the Pyrenees and to make a phased withdraw from the outlying garrisons. On ratification of the Treaty of Valen\u00e7ay he was to move his force to the French city of [[Lyons]].{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=411}} On 14 January he received further orders that because the situation was so grave on the eastern front he was to immediately send further forces to the east, even though ratification of the Treaty of Valen\u00e7ay had not been received. This would reduce the size of Suchet's field army to 18,000 men.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=412}}\n\nThe Allies heard that Suchet was hemorrhaging men and mistakenly thought that his army was smaller than it was, so on 16 January they attacked. Suchet had not yet started the process of sending more men back to France and was able to stop the Sicilians (and a small contingent of British artillery in support) at the [[Battle of Molins de Rey (1814)|Battle of Molins de Rey]] because he still had a local preponderance of men. The allies suffered 68 casualties; the French, 30 killed and about 150 wounded.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=411}}\n\nAfter Suchet sent many men to Lyons, he left an isolated garrison in Barcelona and concentrated his forces on the town of Gerona calling in [[flying column]]s and evacuating some minor outposts. However his field army was now down to 15,000 cavalry and infantry (and excluding the garrisons in northern Catalonia).{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=415}}\n\nThe last actions in this theatre happened at the [[Siege of Barcelona (1808)|siege of Barcelona]] on 23 February; the French sallied out of Barcelona to test the besiegers' lines, as they thought (wrongly) that the Anglo-Sicilian forces had departed. They failed to break through the lines, and forces under the command of the Spanish General [[Pedro Sarsfield]] stopped them. The French General [[Pierre-Joseph Habert]] tried another sortie on 16 April (several days after Napoleon had abdicated) and the French were again stopped with about 300 of them killed.{{sfn|Oman|1930|p=431}} Habert eventually surrendered on 25 April.{{sfn|Gates|2002|p=459}}\n\nOn 1 March Suchet received orders to send 10,000 more men to Lyons. On 7 March Beurmann's division of 9,661 men left for Lyons. With the exception of [[Figueras]], Suchet abandoned all the remaining fortresses in Catalonia that the French garrisoned (and that were not closely besieged by Allied forces), and in doing so was able to create a new field force of about 14,000 men, which were concentrated in front of Figueras in early April.{{sfn|Oman|1930|pp=424\u2013425, 431}}{{efn|There were a further 13,000 French troops besieged in Barcelona, Tortosa, Saguntun and other fortresses, who were under siege and not able to extract themselves to join Suchet at Figueras {{harv|Oman|1930|p=425}}.}}\n\nIn the meantime, because the Allies underestimated the size of Suchet's force and believed that 3,000 more men had left for Lyon and that Suchet, with the remnant of his army, was crossing the Pyrenees to join Soult in the Atlantic theatre, the Allies began to redeploy their forces.

The Portuguese and Spanish authorities were neglecting the payment and supply of their troops. Wellington had also difficulties of a similar kind with his own government, and also the Spanish soldiers, in revenge for many French outrages, had become guilty of grave excesses in France, so that Wellington took the extreme step of sending 25,000 of them back to Spain and resigning the command of their army (though his resignation was subsequently withdrawn). So great was the tension at this crisis that a rupture with Spain seemed possible, but this did not happen.{{sfn|Robinson|1911|p=96}}{{efn|On 11 December, Napoleon, beleaguered and desperate, agreed to a separate peace with Spain under the [[Treaty of Valen\u00e7ay]], under which he would release and recognize Ferdinand in exchange for a complete cessation of hostilities.

The blocks located closer to the interior of the district tend to be mostly residential, while those located beside the Persian Gulf coastline have a great deal of commercial and up-scale residential real estate. The interior residential areas boast a huge population of foreigners consisting mainly of those from the Indian sub-continent and other Arabs who are not native to the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]] area.\n\n==Facilities==\n\nSalmiya is host to numerous [[mosques]], an [[aquarium]], a Scientific Center, an [[IMAX]] movie theater, football stadium, medical centers, a Roman Catholic Chapel, the district passport office (\"Jawazat\") and a well-equipped park beside the 5th Ring Road. Notable malls include the Salmiya Souq Mega-mall which was the first mall in the nation, Marina Mall in the Marina World shopping and entertainment district, and the [[Omniya mall|Omariya mall]]. The Gulf Road is coveted for its amazing sea vistas and is the main hub for new construction of future buildings and renovations.

It is notable to point out that the more eastward away from the capital one moves along the strip, the fancier and pricier the shops are in general. There are many [[gold]] and fabric shops in the \"Old [[Souk]]\" area located onwards from the intersection of the 4th Ring Road and the strip.kuwait is very epic\n\n==History==\nSalmiya has been a model district in the context of modernization. It has undertaken a major face lift in recent times primarily due to ever-expanding commercial real estate on the Gulf Road. The popular Salem Al-Mubarak Shopping strip is in relative close proximity to the capital. The boom in real estate in Salmiya has seen its demographics being constantly on the move. Increasing rental prices have gradually pushed out its working class expatriate community towards the interior districts of Kuwait.\n\nThe influx of foreigners to Salmiya is of historical importance dating as far back as the 1960s. During the [[Gulf War]] Salmiya was destroyed by invading Iraqi occupation, but from 1993 onward it was gradually rebuilt and re-populated. The old rugged 3-storied buildings and open fields, which Salmiya was famous for, have given way to high density layouts of high-rise apartments and complexes. The beach front, once a hub and harbor for the fishing and [[pearl diving]] community, has been transformed into a well-developed and modern bustling commercial avenue. Salmiya is also one of the most expensive area for real estate in the country.\n\n== Sister Cities ==\nSouth Park - Colorado\n\n== Education ==\nThere are several educational institutions located in Salmiya. The [[American University of Kuwait]] which is only walking-distance from the heart of Salmiya Centre. Also nearby is the [[Gulf English School of Kuwait|Gulf English School]] and [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Kowe\u00eft|The French School of Kuwait]]. The [[American International School of Kuwait]] is also located in Salmiya. There is a large number of schools catering to different nationalities. Notably among these are the Indian, Arab, and Pakistani schools present in the area serving their respective communities. The [[Pakistan School and College]] is the oldest school in Kuwait. The [[Indian Community School]], and [[Indian English Academy School]] (a branch of Don Bosco Schools, India) and Indian Public School are notable schools that largely cater to the Indian community in Salmiya.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
