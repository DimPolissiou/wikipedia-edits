Retrieved January 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nWith six ''Mario Kart'' games released on home consoles, three on portable handheld consoles, four arcade games co-developed with [[Namco]] and one for mobile phones, the ''Mario Kart'' series includes a total of fourteen entries. The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters.

The ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' series features [[Bandai Namco]] characters such as [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mario Kart Arcade GP |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/games/triforce/mario_kart_arcade_gp |website=Nintendo Life |accessdate=April 5, 2019|date=December 2011 }}</ref> The [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' added [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and Villager and [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]] from ''[[Animal Crossing]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matulef |first1=Jeffrey |title=Mario Kart 8 getting Zelda and Animal Crossing DLC |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-26-mario-kart-8-is-getting-zelda-and-animal-crossing-dlc |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=April 5, 2019 |date=August 27, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' features 42 characters, including the Inklings from ''[[Splatoon]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bashore |first1=Nicholas |title=Here's Every New Character in 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe' |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/30945-mario-kart-8-deluxe-all-new-characters-gold-mario-unlock |website=Inverse |accessdate=April 5, 2019 |language=en |date=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Courses===\nMany course themes recur throughout the series. Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced. Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.\n\n==List of ''Mario Kart'' games==\n{{VG timeline\n|range1 = 1992-\n|range1_color = #6cbe45 #218800\n| 1992 = ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[VB Mario Kart]]'' (Cancelled)\n| 1996 = ''[[Mario Kart 64]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]''\n| 2005b = ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' \n| 2007 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]''\n| 2019 = ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''\n}}\n\n===Console games=== <!-- includes home and handheld; shortened for brevity -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em; text-align: center\"\n! rowspan = \"2\" | Year !! rowspan=\"2\" | Game !! rowspan=\"2\" | Platform !! colspan=\"5\" |[[Virtual Console]]/<br />[[Nintendo Switch Online]] re-release\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii U !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | New 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Switch\n|-\n| 1992 || ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' || [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}}\n|-\n| 1996 ||''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' || [[Nintendo 64|N64]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' || [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2003 || ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' || [[GameCube|GCN]] || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' || [[Nintendo DS|DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2008 || ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' || [[Wii]] || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2011 || ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' || [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2014 ||''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' || [[Wii U]]|| {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2017 ||''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' || [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}}\n|}\n{{legend|#D2FFD2|text=[[File:Green check.svg|13px]]|Available on Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online}}\n{{legend|#FFB|text={{Dagger}}|Available by using backwards compatibility}}\n{{legend|#DDFBFF|text={{Double-dagger}}|Available natively on the console}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\">''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'' can be played on Nintendo 3DS systems that feature the Nintendo 3DS Ambassadors program.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Arcade games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP|Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' (2005, [[Arcade game|Arcade]]) (Co-developed by [[Namco]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP 2|Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007, Arcade) (Co-developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP DX|Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]'' (2013, Arcade) (Co-developed by Namco Bandai Games)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2013/02/05/namco-formally-announces-mario-kart-arcade-grand-prix-dx/|title=Namco Formally Announces Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix DX - Arcade Heroes|date=February 5, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP VR|Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]'' (2017, Arcade) (by [[Bandai Namco Studios]])<ref name=VRZone>{{cite web|url=http://vrzone-pic.com/en/activity/mariocart.html|title=MARIO KART ARCADE GP VR - VR ZONE SHINJUKU|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-arcade-gp-vr-announced-for-bandai-namcos-virtual-reality-arcade-played-with-htc-vive/|title=Mario Kart Arcade GP VR announced for Bandai Namco's virtual reality arcade, played with HTC Vive - Nintendo Everything|date=June 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' (2019)\n\n===Canceled games===\n* ''VB Mario Kart'' was scheduled for the [[Virtual Boy]] in 1995.

The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

Alternate outfits for certain characters are also available as rare items. This is the first ''Mario Kart'' game to be released for a non-Nintendo device and introduces [[Gacha game|gacha]] and [[loot box]] mechanics, as well as continuously-renewing character outfits and karts. Character-specific items and increased item probabilities have been re-added. The Mega Mushroom also makes its return after an eleven-year absence. The game also added Frenzy Mode, which happens when the character receives three of the same item during the race.\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\n''Mario Kart'' mainly features [[List of Mario franchise characters|characters from the ''Mario'' franchise]].

Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced. Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle.

{"title_page": "Dungeon Hills", "text_new": "[[File:Dungeon Hills.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\nThe '''Dungeon Hills''' are a range of hills in the [[Galloway Hills]] range, part of the [[Southern Uplands]] of [[Scotland]]. The central of three parallel ridges, they are neighboured by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] to the west and the [[Rhinns of Kells]] to the east. The range is also perpendicular to the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range, immediately south. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the lowest and craggiest of the Galloway Hills with the highest, Mullwharchar, reaching 692m. They are split between [[East Ayrshire]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] along the Mullwharchar-Dungeon Hill col, following the Pulskaig Burn. Often regarded as the roughest hills in the Southern Uplands, walks can frequently take longer than anticipated due to the underfoot conditions of tussocks and bog. The range is the most remote of the Galloway Hills as the nearest road link to the north is approximately 2 miles away at Craigmalloch on the banks of Loch Doon, requiring an approach along an unclassified road. <ref>https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/loch-doon-castle/getting-here/</ref> As a result, many hillwalkers begin their walk at the Glentrool Visitor Centre to the southwest and follow the path past [[Loch Trool]] to then ascend opposite the Gairland Burn and eventually to [[Loch Valley]] and [[Loch Neldricken]]. A longer but initially easier path can be followed from the same start point, following the path to the [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]], but cutting right at Culsharg bothy and following the Buchan Burn to Loch Enoch for a clockwise round instead.\n\nFrom north to south the hills are: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The central of three parallel ridges, they are neighboured by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] to the west and the [[Rhinns of Kells]] to the east. The range is also perpendicular to the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range, immediately south. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the lowest and craggiest of the Galloway Hills with the highest, Mullwharchar, reaching 692m. They are split between [[East Ayrshire]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] along the Mullwharchar-Dungeon Hill col, following the Pulskaig Burn. Often regarded as the roughest hills in the Southern Uplands, walks can frequently take longer than anticipated due to the underfoot conditions of tussocks and bog. The range is the most remote of the Galloway Hills as the nearest road link to the north is approximately 2 miles away at Craigmalloch on the banks of Loch Doon, requiring an approach along an unclassified road. <ref>https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/loch-doon-castle/getting-here/</ref> As a result, many hillwalkers begin their walk at the Glentrool Visitor Centre to the southwest and follow the path past [[Loch Trool]] to then ascend opposite the Gairland Burn and eventually to [[Loch Valley]] and [[Loch Neldricken]]. A longer but initially easier path can be followed from the same start point, following the path to the [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]], but cutting right at Culsharg bothy and following the Buchan Burn to Loch Enoch for a clockwise round instead.\n\nFrom north to south the hills are: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He was most active in film in the late 1960s through the 1970s, most notably in [[Yu Hyun-mok]]'s ''[[Bun-Rye's Story]]''. As he grew older, Lee shifted to a primarily TV career in the 1990s, receiving acclaim for his roles in the [[Korean drama|television dramas]] ''Live As I Please'' (written by Yoo Ho), ''Pungwoon (Crisis)'', ''What is Love'' (written by [[Kim Soo-hyun (writer)|Kim Soo-hyun]]) and ''[[Hur Jun (TV series)|Hur Jun]]''.<ref name=\"KMDb Korean\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kmdb.or.kr/actor/mm_basic.asp?person_id=00004082|script-title=ko:\uc774\uc21c\uc7ac|trans-title=Lee Soon-jae|work=[[Korean Movie Database]]|accessdate=2010-02-09|language=Korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Park|first=Jin-hai|title=Culture minister hails elderly entertainers|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/05/386_135397.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=9 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Lee Soon-jae (September 5, 2007), who plays the role of King Young-jo in Lee San, Wind of the Palace|url=http://content.mbc.co.kr/english/interview/1673260_56322.html|website=MBC Global Media|accessdate=2014-06-13|date=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1992 to 1996, Lee served as a member of the 14th [[National Assembly of South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Yoon|first=Won-sup|title=''Politainers'' Speak Out Again in 2007 Election|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/09/160_14541.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=28 November 2007}}</ref> He quit politics after one term after finding the political climate \"too barren\" for his taste.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Eun-joo|title=Serious politicians or image-builders?|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2889013|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-06|date=24 April 2008}}</ref> Lee remains active in his various advocacies, such as the Korea Broadcasting Actors Union.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Bo-ra|title=KBS actors protest against non-payment|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20121121000725|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=21 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jeong-yoon|last2=Kim|first2=Sung-mi|title=World Traditional Medicine EXPO to be held in Sancheong in 2013|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120224001067|work=Korea IT Times|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=9 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ji|first=Yong-jin|title=Organizing Committee Meeting for 5th DMZ Docs Held|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=2512|work=Korean Film Council|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe is also a professor of Film Arts at [[Sejong University]], a [[professor emeritus]] of Performing Arts at [[Gachon University]], and the director of the SG Academy.

One particular scene became a huge hit among young audiences: when his stern grandfather character discovers [[porn]] while browsing through a family member's computer files, then embarrassingly gets caught watching. It went viral, giving rise to numerous parodies in which \"Yadong (Porn) Soon-jae\" is involved in R-rated hijinks. Lee was surprised that even his granddaughter asked for his autograph for her friends, adding, \"Even during my best years, my daughter never asked me for that.\" Despite having no superstars in the cast, the sitcom received high ratings, which Lee attributed to successfully building comic tension. He said, \"For an actor to be funny, he's got to play things straight. [...] It's about finding the comedy in something serious.\"<ref name=\"pretv\" /> But Lee also lamented the recent trend of casting inexperienced actors in leading roles on TV, saying, \"It's important to know the basics, like the language. How can you act, when you don't even know how to pronounce? Acting is not a simple thing, and this I can say from experience.\" He later returned as the family patriarch in ''[[High Kick Through the Roof]]'', which shares the same concept as the previous sitcom, but with a different cast and characters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Network to Bring New Sitcom, Dramas|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51066.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=1 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Experienced Actors Stealing Spotlight|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51915.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=16 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Good Morning President====\nIn 2009, Lee made his big screen comeback after 20 years in television, in [[Jang Jin]]'s comedy ''[[Good Morning President]]''. The movie tells the story of three fictional Korean presidents, and in the first segment, Lee played a well-respected elderly president nearing the end of his term who espouses frugality and charity, but then agonizes whether to take the money when he unexpectedly wins the lottery. Lee said, \"I was impressed with how much times have changed; before it would have been impossible to parody the president. The film tries to show that heads of state are only human, just like you and me, which I think makes the movie distinctive, as well as fresh and fun for viewers.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Actor Jang Dong-kun Returns as President|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/141_52271.html|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=22 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Park|first=Sun-young|title=Korean stars take turns playing president|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2910496|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Late Blossom====\nIn 2011, Lee, Yoon So-jung, [[Song Jae-ho]] and [[Kim Soo-mi]] starred in ''[[Late Blossom]]'', a tearjerker romance about two elderly couples, based on the popular [[webtoon]] ''I Love You'' by [[Kang Full]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cha|first=Hyo-jin|title=''I Love You'', The Most Beautiful Confession|url=http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|work=Worldyan News|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=14 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214250/http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|archive-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee said the movie was a rare chance for him and other senior actors to play leading roles on the big screen. He added that Korea's senior citizen population had surpassed five million, and \"not understanding their feelings would be a failure of television dramas, movies and even elections. Young people might be under the illusion that life is over after turning 60, but the heart doesn't change despite getting old.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kwon|first=Mee-yoo|title=Blossom portrays love in twilight years|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/03/141_80850.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> Initially difficult to finance due to [[ageism]], ''Late Blossom'' had a small shooting and marketing budget compared to most Korean mainstream films. But it became a [[sleeper hit]], recouping four times its cost in just a few weeks. Lee also won Best Actor under the international film category at the China [[Golden Rooster Awards|Golden Rooster]] and [[Hundred Flowers Awards|Hundred Flowers]] Film Festival, becoming its oldest recipient. Lee said, \"I never thought I'd win. What a surprise. It feels great to know that ''Late Blossom'' has been received well overseas. I thought it would be hard for an actor from television dramas to be awarded a prize at film awards, not to mention the unexpected pleasure of winning at a foreign film festival. I have received the best entertainer award and achievement award before, but receiving this makes me happier and more thrilled.\" It was his first best actor award for a film in 34 years since the 1977 [[Baeksang Arts Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Min-ji|title=Lee Soon Jae Wins Best Actor Award at Major Chinese Film Awards|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/article/1254|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=enewsWorld|date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=Lee Soon-jae wins best actor award at Chinese film fest|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2011102810401935785|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=10Asia|date=28 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Theater====\nLee returned to the stage in 2012 in ''Father'', a Korean adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. This was his third time to play the character [[Willy Loman]]. Lee said, \"When I first played this role in 1978, some parts were rather incomprehensible. But now, as our society developed, we can finally fully understand what those lines mean. That is the beauty of working on masterpieces like Arthur Miller's. I feel a satisfaction and regret at the same time, for I have reached a new comprehension, and for the perspective that I have yet to discover.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=So-young|title=What ''Father'' Means to us|url=http://www.dgupost.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1324|work=The [[Dongguk University|Dongguk]] Post|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=An interview with Lee Soon Jae, currently headlining the play ''Father''|url=http://lsgfan.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/lee-soon-jae-talks-his-play-father-and-acting-shows-love-for-the-likes-of-kim-myung-min-lee-seung-gi-ha-ji-won/|work=LSGfan|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=6 September 2012}}</ref> He reprised the role in 2013, under the direction of [[Kim Myung-gon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Touching and Healing Drama ''Father''|url=http://www.k-popculture.com/?p=2349|work=K-PopCulture|accessdate=2013-07-08|date=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Grandpas Over Flowers====\nIn 2013, cable channel [[TVN (South Korea)|tvN]] launched the [[travel documentary|travel]]-[[reality show]] ''[[Grandpas Over Flowers]]'' (the title [[parody|parodies]] the [[manga]] ''[[Boys Over Flowers]]'') directed by Na Young-seok (previously of ''[[1 Night 2 Days]]'').<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woo|first1=Jae-yeon|title=Golden Guys Get Good Ratings|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/07/19/golden-guys-get-good-ratings/|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2014-09-11|date=19 July 2014}}</ref> Defying a youth-centered entertainment industry, the hit show stars four veteran actors in their 70s, Lee, [[Shin Goo]], [[Park Geun-hyung]] and [[Baek Il-seob]], as they go on a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking tour]] of [[France]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Senior actors lead TV show, defying youth-centered industry|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130612001034|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=12 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Sun-min|title=Grandpa actors get own show|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2973778|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=29 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Grandpas' Flowery Youth|url=http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/vod/special_list_view.asp?idx=365|work=[[Korean Movie Database]]|accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref>\n\n====Idol School====\nIn 2017, he joined [[Idol School (2017 TV series)|Idol School]] as principal and narrator.

One particular scene became a huge hit among young audiences: when his stern grandfather character discovers [[porn]] while browsing through a family member's computer files, then embarrassingly gets caught watching. It went viral, giving rise to numerous parodies in which \"Yadong (Porn) Soon-jae\" is involved in R-rated hijinks. Lee was surprised that even his granddaughter asked for his autograph for her friends, adding, \"Even during my best years, my daughter never asked me for that.\" Despite having no superstars in the cast, the sitcom received high ratings, which Lee attributed to successfully building comic tension. He said, \"For an actor to be funny, he's got to play things straight. [...] It's about finding the comedy in something serious.\"<ref name=\"pretv\" /> But Lee also lamented the recent trend of casting inexperienced actors in leading roles on TV, saying, \"It's important to know the basics, like the language. How can you act, when you don't even know how to pronounce? Acting is not a simple thing, and this I can say from experience.\" He later returned as the family patriarch in ''[[High Kick Through the Roof]]'', which shares the same concept as the previous sitcom, but with a different cast and characters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Network to Bring New Sitcom, Dramas|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51066.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=1 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Experienced Actors Stealing Spotlight|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/201_51915.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=16 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Good Morning President====\nIn 2009, Lee made his big screen comeback after 20 years in television, in [[Jang Jin]]'s comedy ''[[Good Morning President]]''. The movie tells the story of three fictional Korean presidents, and in the first segment, Lee played a well-respected elderly president nearing the end of his term who espouses frugality and charity, but then agonizes whether to take the money when he unexpectedly wins the lottery. Lee said, \"I was impressed with how much times have changed; before it would have been impossible to parody the president. The film tries to show that heads of state are only human, just like you and me, which I think makes the movie distinctive, as well as fresh and fun for viewers.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Actor Jang Dong-kun Returns as President|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/09/141_52271.html|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=22 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Park|first=Sun-young|title=Korean stars take turns playing president|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2910496|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Late Blossom====\nIn 2011, Lee, Yoon So-jung, [[Song Jae-ho]] and [[Kim Soo-mi]] starred in ''[[Late Blossom]]'', a tearjerker romance about two elderly couples, based on the popular [[webtoon]] ''I Love You'' by [[Kang Full]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cha|first=Hyo-jin|title=''I Love You'', The Most Beautiful Confession|url=http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|work=Worldyan News|accessdate=2013-07-05|date=14 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214250/http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1384|archive-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee said the movie was a rare chance for him and other senior actors to play leading roles on the big screen. He added that Korea's senior citizen population had surpassed five million, and \"not understanding their feelings would be a failure of television dramas, movies and even elections. Young people might be under the illusion that life is over after turning 60, but the heart doesn't change despite getting old.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kwon|first=Mee-yoo|title=Blossom portrays love in twilight years|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/03/141_80850.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-04|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> Initially difficult to finance due to [[ageism]], ''Late Blossom'' had a small shooting and marketing budget compared to most Korean mainstream films. But it became a [[sleeper hit]], recouping four times its cost in just a few weeks. Lee also won Best Actor under the international film category at the China [[Golden Rooster Awards|Golden Rooster]] and [[Hundred Flowers Awards|Hundred Flowers]] Film Festival, becoming its oldest recipient. Lee said, \"I never thought I'd win. What a surprise. It feels great to know that ''Late Blossom'' has been received well overseas. I thought it would be hard for an actor from television dramas to be awarded a prize at film awards, not to mention the unexpected pleasure of winning at a foreign film festival. I have received the best entertainer award and achievement award before, but receiving this makes me happier and more thrilled.\" It was his first best actor award for a film in 34 years since the 1977 [[Baeksang Arts Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Min-ji|title=Lee Soon Jae Wins Best Actor Award at Major Chinese Film Awards|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/article/1254|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=enewsWorld|date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Lucia|title=Lee Soon-jae wins best actor award at Chinese film fest|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2011102810401935785|accessdate=2013-07-04|work=10Asia|date=28 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Theater====\nLee returned to the stage in 2012 in ''Father'', a Korean adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. This was his third time to play the character [[Willy Loman]]. Lee said, \"When I first played this role in 1978, some parts were rather incomprehensible. But now, as our society developed, we can finally fully understand what those lines mean. That is the beauty of working on masterpieces like Arthur Miller's.
