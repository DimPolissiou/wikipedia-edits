(Great Britain)|A1(M)]], between [[Letchworth Garden City]] to the north and [[Welwyn Garden City]] to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].\n\n==Etymology==\nStevenage may derive from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''sti\u00feen \u0101c'' / ''sti\u00f0en \u0101c'' / ''stithen ac'' (various [[Old English language|Old English]] dialects cited here) meaning '(place at) the stiff [[oak]]'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes|first=H.G.|year=1948|chapter=A Land of Woods and Water|title=English Place-Names|location=Edinburgh|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd.|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe name was recorded as ''Stithen\u00e6ce'', c.1060 and ''Stigenace'' in 1086 in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\n==History==\nStevenage lies near the line of the [[Roman road]] from [[Verulamium]] to [[Baldock]]. Some [[Romano-British]] remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered in 1986 during new house building in the Chells Manor area. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is ''[[Six Hills]]'', six [[tumulus|tumuli]] by the side of the old [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] \u2013 presumably the burial places of a local family.\n\nA little to the east of the Roman sites the first [[Saxon people|Saxon]] camp was made in a clearing in the woods where the church, [[manor house]] and the first [[village]] were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall (though before the New Town Shephall was a separate parish and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth).\n\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] the [[Lord of the Manor]] was the [[Abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road and in 1281 it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to hold a weekly market and annual fair (still held in the High Street).\n\nThe earliest part of [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]] dates from the 12th century but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The known list of priests or rectors is relatively complete from 1213.\n\nThe remains of a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] moated homestead in Whomerley Wood is an 80-yard-square trench almost 5 feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle, and both Roman and later pottery has been found there.\n\nAround 1500 the Church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a [[clerestory]].\n\nIn 1558 [[Thomas Alleyne]], a rector of the town, founded a free [[grammar school]] for boys, [[The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School]], which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring [[Hitchin]]) until 1989 when it merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. [[Francis Cammaerts]] was headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed [[comprehensive school]] and is now an [[Academy]] as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to [[Great Ashby]], but the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010\u201315)]] proposed scrapping the move owing to [[Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts]].\n\nStevenage's prosperity came in part from the North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century. Many inns in the High Street served the [[stage coach]]es, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800.\n\nIn 1857 the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed, and the era of the stage coach had ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, \"The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.\"\n\nIn 1928 Philip Vincent bought the [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]] out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]]. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.\n\n==Stevenage New Town==\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square building works in 1959.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Square under development in 1959]]\n[[File:Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\n[[File:Stevenage Old Town - Middle Row.jpg|alt=Middle Row in Stevenage Old Town|thumb|Middle Row, Stevenage Old Town]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square CGI.jpg|alt=|thumb|CGI of Stevenage Town Square]]\n[[File:Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way - Stevenage.jpg|alt=|thumb|Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way, Stevenage]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\nSlow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the [[Second World War]], when the [[County of London Plan|Abercrombie Plan]] called for the establishment of a ring of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around London. On 1 August 1946, Stevenage was designated the first New Town under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-37826783|title=The town that aimed for Utopia|first=Jodie|last=Halford|date=11 November 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe plan was not popular and local people protested at a meeting held in the town hall before [[Lewis Silkin]], minister in the Labour Government of Clement Attlee. As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs 'Stevenage' to 'Silkingrad'. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town's residents): \"It's no good your jeering, it's going to be done.\" Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) 'entirely against' the expansion, the plan went ahead.<ref name=Austerity>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|author=David Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=161, 162|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed.\n\nIn 1949 the radical town planner Dr [[Monica Felton]] became Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the [[Korean War]] (for which she was later awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]) sullied her reputation.<ref>Mark Clapson, ''The rise and fall of Dr Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist'' on [http://www.fau.usp.br/iphs/abstractsAndPapersFiles/IPHS_miolo_20120711.pdf]</ref>\nFelton was replaced first by [[Allan Duff]] and later [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], who carried the project to completion.<ref>Stephen Ward, ''Peaceful Path: Building Garden Cities and New Towns'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2016</ref> [[Gordon Stephenson]] was the planner, [[Peter Shepheard]] the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer.<ref>Stevenage Museum, [http://www.talkingnewtowns.org.uk/content/topics/developing-a-new-town/eric-claxton-creating-safe-town Eric Claxton about creating a safe town] (interview transcript), 18 April 1986</ref> Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible.\n\nIn keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods. The first two of these to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood 'Estates', in 1951. The ''Twin Foxes'' pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage's first 'new' public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin [[poaching|poachers]] ([[Albert and Ebenezer Fox]]). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The \"Edward the Confessor\" pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary's Church in nearby [[Walkern]] as [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward]] reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern's church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the \"Our Mutual Friend\" in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of [[Our Mutual Friend|a novel]] by [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens was an occasional guest of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in nearby [[Knebworth House]] and knew Stevenage very well.\n\nNext to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and [[Symonds Green]]. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. {{As of|2014}} it was still under construction. The Government gave almost \u00a32 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 2 July 2013  (pt 0003)}}</ref>\n\nThe pedestrianized town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in [[UK|Britain]], taking its inspiration from the [[Lijnbaan]] in Rotterdam,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pedestrian and the City |last=Hass-Klau |first=Carmen |year=2014 |publisher= Routledge |page=87 }}</ref> and was officially opened in 1959 by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Architectural guide to Cambridge and East Anglia since 1920 |last=McKean |first=Charles |year=1982 |publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects|ERA Publications Board, RIBA Eastern Region]] |isbn=978-0-907598-01-5 |page=174 }}</ref> By the [[clock tower]] and ornamental pool is ''Joyride'', a mother and child sculpture by [[Franta Belsky]].  Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.\n\nNext to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a cathedral-like Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban's, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, 'The Urban Elephant' by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.\n\nAdjacent to yet separate from the residential parts of the town is the Industrial Area. For many years [[British Aerospace]] (now [[MBDA]]) was the largest employer in the town but now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] has a large pharmaceutical research laboratory complex (which is known as 'The Palace' to many of its inhabitants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|title=Peter's weather website|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234840/http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref> A smaller but interesting enterprise is [[Astrium]], which for some decades (as part of British Aerospace and its predecessors) has manufactured spacecraft, both as prime contractor and as equipment supplier.\n\nThere are many small- to medium-size firms as well.

He was so adamant about roundabouts that he had a house built for himself on the gyratory system in the Old Town.\n\nStevenage is served by the [[A1(M) motorway]]. The old [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] passes through the centre of the town, and the High Street in the Old Town has several pubs that were [[coaching inn]]s on this road; it is mostly now classified as the [[B197 road|B197]]. Stevenage is also served by the [[A602 road|A602]], connecting the town to [[Hitchin]], [[Watton-at-Stone]], Hertford and [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]].\n\nBuses within and to outside the town are provided by several operators, the main within the town being [[Arriva Shires & Essex#Hitchin/Stevenage|Arriva The Shires]]. Other operators include [[Centrebus]], [[Uno (bus company)|Uno]], Cozy Travel and Trusty Bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|title=About us|date=21 January 2016|website=TrustyBus|access-date=14 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115132524/http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date=15 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe town is served by [[Stevenage railway station]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and has regular commuter services to London and Cambridge, as well as connections to the North and Scotland.\n\n==Education==\nMany schools were built in the 1950s/60s due to an influx of Londoners to affordable terraced housing in areas such as Shephall, Broadwater, Chells and St Nicholas. The town has around 23 primary schools (see below). Some go to the surrounding villages of [[Aston, Hertfordshire|Aston]], [[Benington, Hertfordshire|Benington]], [[Walkern]], [[Datchworth]] for their schooling. Stevenage also has a number of secondary schools and the central campus for North Hertfordshire College.\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Almond Hill Junior<ref>{{cite

(Great Britain)|A1(M)]], between [[Letchworth Garden City]] to the north and [[Welwyn Garden City]] to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].\n\n==Etymology==\nStevenage may derive from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''sti\u00feen \u0101c'' / ''sti\u00f0en \u0101c'' / ''stithen ac'' (various [[Old English language|Old English]] dialects cited here) meaning '(place at) the stiff [[oak]]'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes|first=H.G.|year=1948|chapter=A Land of Woods and Water|title=English Place-Names|location=Edinburgh|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd.|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe name was recorded as ''Stithen\u00e6ce'', c.1060 and ''Stigenace'' in 1086 in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\n==History==\nStevenage lies near the line of the [[Roman road]] from [[Verulamium]] to [[Baldock]]. Some [[Romano-British]] remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered in 1986 during new house building in the Chells Manor area. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is ''[[Six Hills]]'', six [[tumulus|tumuli]] by the side of the old [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] \u2013 presumably the burial places of a local family.\n\nA little to the east of the Roman sites the first [[Saxon people|Saxon]] camp was made in a clearing in the woods where the church, [[manor house]] and the first [[village]] were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall (though before the New Town Shephall was a separate parish and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth).\n\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] the [[Lord of the Manor]] was the [[Abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road and in 1281 it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to hold a weekly market and annual fair (still held in the High Street).\n\nThe earliest part of [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]] dates from the 12th century but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The known list of priests or rectors is relatively complete from 1213.\n\nThe remains of a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] moated homestead in Whomerley Wood is an 80-yard-square trench almost 5 feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle, and both Roman and later pottery has been found there.\n\nAround 1500 the Church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a [[clerestory]].\n\nIn 1558 [[Thomas Alleyne]], a rector of the town, founded a free [[grammar school]] for boys, [[The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School]], which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring [[Hitchin]]) until 1989 when it merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. [[Francis Cammaerts]] was headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed [[comprehensive school]] and is now an [[Academy]] as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to [[Great Ashby]], but the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010\u201315)]] proposed scrapping the move owing to [[Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts]].\n\nStevenage's prosperity came in part from the North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century. Many inns in the High Street served the [[stage coach]]es, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800.\n\nIn 1857 the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed, and the era of the stage coach had ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, \"The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.\"\n\nIn 1928 Philip Vincent bought the [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]] out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]]. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.\n\n==Stevenage New Town==\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square building works in 1959.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Square under development in 1959]]\n[[File:Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\n[[File:Stevenage Old Town - Middle Row.jpg|alt=Middle Row in Stevenage Old Town|thumb|Middle Row, Stevenage Old Town]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square CGI.jpg|alt=|thumb|CGI of Stevenage Town Square]]\n[[File:Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way - Stevenage.jpg|alt=|thumb|Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way, Stevenage]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\nSlow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the [[Second World War]], when the [[County of London Plan|Abercrombie Plan]] called for the establishment of a ring of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around London.

As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs 'Stevenage' to 'Silkingrad'. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town's residents): \"It's no good your jeering, it's going to be done.\" Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) 'entirely against' the expansion, the plan went ahead.<ref name=Austerity>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|author=David Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=161, 162|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed.\n\nIn 1949 the radical town planner Dr [[Monica Felton]] became Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the [[Korean War]] (for which she was later awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]) sullied her reputation.<ref>Mark Clapson, ''The rise and fall of Dr Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist'' on [http://www.fau.usp.br/iphs/abstractsAndPapersFiles/IPHS_miolo_20120711.pdf]</ref>\nFelton was replaced first by [[Allan Duff]] and later [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], who carried the project to completion.<ref>Stephen Ward, ''Peaceful Path: Building Garden Cities and New Towns'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2016</ref> [[Gordon Stephenson]] was the planner, [[Peter Shepheard]] the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer.<ref>Stevenage Museum, [http://www.talkingnewtowns.org.uk/content/topics/developing-a-new-town/eric-claxton-creating-safe-town Eric Claxton about creating a safe town] (interview transcript), 18 April 1986</ref> Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible.\n\nIn keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods. The first two of these to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood 'Estates', in 1951. The ''Twin Foxes'' pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage's first 'new' public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin [[poaching|poachers]] ([[Albert and Ebenezer Fox]]). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The \"Edward the Confessor\" pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary's Church in nearby [[Walkern]] as [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward]] reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern's church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the \"Our Mutual Friend\" in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of [[Our Mutual Friend|a novel]] by [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens was an occasional guest of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in nearby [[Knebworth House]] and knew Stevenage very well.\n\nNext to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and [[Symonds Green]]. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. {{As of|2014}} it was still under construction. The Government gave almost \u00a32 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 2 July 2013  (pt 0003)}}</ref>\n\nThe pedestrianized town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in [[UK|Britain]], taking its inspiration from the [[Lijnbaan]] in Rotterdam,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pedestrian and the City |last=Hass-Klau |first=Carmen |year=2014 |publisher= Routledge |page=87 }}</ref> and was officially opened in 1959 by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Architectural guide to Cambridge and East Anglia since 1920 |last=McKean |first=Charles |year=1982 |publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects|ERA Publications Board, RIBA Eastern Region]] |isbn=978-0-907598-01-5 |page=174 }}</ref> By the [[clock tower]] and ornamental pool is ''Joyride'', a mother and child sculpture by [[Franta Belsky]].  Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.\n\nNext to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a cathedral-like Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban's, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, 'The Urban Elephant' by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.\n\nAdjacent to yet separate from the residential parts of the town is the Industrial Area. For many years [[British Aerospace]] (now [[MBDA]]) was the largest employer in the town but now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] has a large pharmaceutical research laboratory complex (which is known as 'The Palace' to many of its inhabitants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|title=Peter's weather website|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234840/http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref> A smaller but interesting enterprise is [[Astrium]], which for some decades (as part of British Aerospace and its predecessors) has manufactured spacecraft, both as prime contractor and as equipment supplier.\n\nThere are many small- to medium-size firms as well.

The town is a very green town, with avenues of trees (typically Norway Maple) throughout but also large woods such as Monks & Whomerley Wood, which is ancient semi-natural woodland.  Indeed, the [[Woodland Trust]] ranks it as one of the best places in the UK for ease of access to large woodland, with 99.9% of the population having access to woodland over {{convert|2|ha|acre|0}} within {{convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, only slightly behind those living in the [[Forest of Dean]] or [[New Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/mediafile/100083906/space-for-people.pdf|title=2638 Space for People|year=2010|accessdate=3 January 2014|work=[[Woodland Trust]]}}</ref> There are also many playing fields (e.g. St. Nicholas playing fields near Ripon Road). The town's schools all have a substantial amount of ground; key examples are Ashtree Primary School, Moss Bury Primary School, Longmeadow Primary School and Barnwell.\n\nStevenage also has a basketball team: Stevenage Scorpions.\n\nThe town is surrounded by the Stevenage Outer Orbital Path (STOOP), a {{convert|27|mi|km|adj=on}} circuit walk established by the North Herts Ramblers Group in 2008. The circuit provides an informal, active recreational leisure amenity readily available to the residents of Stevenage and the surrounding villages. The STOOP is split into several sections, accessible via a series of links from the town. The route passes through [[Graveley, Hertfordshire|Graveley]], [[Walkern]], [[River Beane|Beane Valley]], [[Datchworth]], [[Woolmer Green]], [[Knebworth Park]], [[St Ippolyts]] and [[Little Wymondley]].

Forster used Rooksnest and the surrounding area as the setting for his novel ''[[Howards End]]''. In the preface to one paperback edition of ''Howards End'' there is a lot to be found about landmarks of Stevenage and their relationship to the story of the novel, such as Stevenage High Street and the [[Six Hills]]. The land north of St Nicholas' Church, known as Forster Country, is the last remaining farmland within the boundary of Stevenage borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forstercountry.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=27|title=Where is Forster Country?|publisher=Friends of the Forster Country|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=23 August 2009}}</ref> Forster was unhappy with the development of new Stevenage, which would, in his words, \"fall out of the blue sky like a meteorite upon the ancient and delicate scenery of Hertfordshire\".<ref name=Austerity/>\n\nAlso close to Stevenage is [[Knebworth House]], a [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic]] stately home and venue of globally renowned rock concerts since 1974. The house was once home to [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], Victorian English novelist and spiritualist.\n\n==Transport==\nA distinctive feature of Stevenage is its urban landscape.

Despite this network, the bike mode share is 2.7%.<ref>{{cite news|title=Build it and they will come?

He was so adamant about roundabouts that he had a house built for himself on the gyratory system in the Old Town.\n\nStevenage is served by the [[A1(M) motorway]]. The old [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] passes through the centre of the town, and the High Street in the Old Town has several pubs that were [[coaching inn]]s on this road; it is mostly now classified as the [[B197 road|B197]]. Stevenage is also served by the [[A602 road|A602]], connecting the town to [[Hitchin]], [[Watton-at-Stone]], Hertford and [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]].\n\nBuses within and to outside the town are provided by several operators, the main within the town being [[Arriva Shires & Essex#Hitchin/Stevenage|Arriva The Shires]]. Other operators include [[Centrebus]], [[Uno (bus company)|Uno]], Cozy Travel and Trusty Bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|title=About us|date=21 January 2016|website=TrustyBus|access-date=14 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115132524/http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date=15 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe town is served by [[Stevenage railway station]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and has regular commuter services to London and Cambridge, as well as connections to the North and Scotland.\n\n==Education==\nMany schools were built in the 1950s/60s due to an influx of Londoners to affordable terraced housing in areas such as Shephall, Broadwater, Chells and St Nicholas. The town has around 23 primary schools (see below). Some go to the surrounding villages of [[Aston, Hertfordshire|Aston]], [[Benington, Hertfordshire|Benington]], [[Walkern]], [[Datchworth]] for their schooling.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he is most notable for his long service as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\nA native of [[Chicago]], Yates graduated from [[Lake View High School (Chicago)|Lake View High School]] in 1928.  He received bachelor's (1931) and law (1933) degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Chicago.  In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.  After an unsuccessful run against [[Everett Dirksen]] for the United States Senate in [[1962 United States Senate election in Illinois|1962]], in 1964 Yates was again elected to Congress.  he served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998.  He was a longtime member of the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], where he became known for staunch U.S. support of [[Israel]], and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts.

He received bachelor's (1931) and law (1933) degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Chicago.  In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.  After an unsuccessful run against [[Everett Dirksen]] for the United States Senate in [[1962 United States Senate election in Illinois|1962]], in 1964 Yates was again elected to Congress.  he served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998.  He was a longtime member of the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], where he became known for staunch U.S. support of [[Israel]], and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts.  Yates was also an advocate for several liberal causes, including opposition to discrimination based on age.  At the time he concluded his service, he was the oldest person to ever serve in the House (age 89), and one of the longest-tenured members in the history of Congress (total House service of 48 years).\n\nYates died in Washington in 2000.

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name=\"soapnet\">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = March 19, 2007 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.<ref>Gilbert, Annie, ''All My Afternoons'', p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Brady and [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera]] families were introduced, and their rivalry quickly cemented their places as core families in Salem beside the Hortons. Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], Shane and Kimberly, and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = \"ratings\"/>\n\n===Best-remembered stories===\n<!-- These were a sampling of the most remembered story lines on Days, as referenced by SOAPnet.

He continued with the show as a storyline consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many changes to the head writer position occurred.

His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap ''[[Passions (TV series)|Passions]]'', when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as [[Sally Sussman Morina]] and [[Tom Langan]], failed to keep the ratings success, and additional head writer turnover continued until Reilly \u2013 who would continue in his role as head writer and consulting producer of ''Passions'' after rejoining ''Days'' \u2013 returned to the series in 2003.\n\nFive-time Daytime Emmy winner [[Hogan Sheffer]] was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008.

However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1968\u201369 television season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader CBS. By 1973, the show \u2013 pitted against CBS's popular ''[[Guiding Light]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/1:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|CT]]) \u2013<ref name=\"daytime\">{{cite web|title=NBC Daytime|url=http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|author=Curt Alliaume|website=Curt Alliaume's Utterly Irrelevant Web Site|accessdate=July 10, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020409024925/http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=April 9, 2002}}</ref> had matched the first-place ratings of ''As the World Turns'' and fellow NBC soap ''Another World''. Due to the success of the program, NBC expanded ''Days'' from a 30-minute timeslot to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975.<ref name=\"dayssummary\"/>  This expansion had followed the lead of ''Another World,'' which became the first hour-long television soap opera 3\u00bd months earlier on January 6. Furthermore, ''Days of Our Lives''{{'}} new starting time of 1:30&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/12:30 (CT)<ref name=\"daytime\"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the rights to the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'') to little to no success.\n\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC's daytime lineup proved to be short-lived, as viewership for ''Days of Our Lives'' began to decline in 1977. Much of this dropoff was associated with ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half-hour of ''Days of Our Lives'' and CBS' ''As The World Turns'' also airing at 1:30PM since it first premiered in April 1956. By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''All My Children'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00&nbsp;p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.\n\nBy 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''Another World'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. Overall though, the entire NBC soap lineup had been experiencing trouble maintaining ratings traction against their competitors on CBS and ABC. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The \"supercouple\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983\u201384 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. As ''Another World'' underwent its final ratings slump during the second half of the 1990s, many affiliates swapped the time slots of ''Another World'' and ''Days of Our Lives'', which usually aired an hour earlier.\nWhile individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of  television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network's direct affiliates.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not \"continue past 2009.\"<ref name=\"zucker\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007 | date=January 17, 2007}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show, which was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous \u2014 ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. \"Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It\". April 17, 2007.</ref>\n\n''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008\u20132009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18\u201349 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009\u20132010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name=\"Days of our Lives Renewed\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC \u2013 Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007|date=January 17, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308095643/http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever starting in 2011, while ABC canceled both ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'', ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18\u201349 women demographic. The cancellation of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again.

Since January 1993, after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' weekdays at 3:00&nbsp;p.m., while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Some [[Central Time Zone]] affiliates carry the program at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. in tandem with NBC's Eastern Time Zone feed; one example is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s [[WGBA-TV]], which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated [[local news]]cast against long-established local competition. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans. [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[KSL-TV]] moved the show to late nights at 1:05&nbsp;a.m. on September 9, 2013 for unknown reasons, though it was rumored to be due to a romantic plot line between gay characters [[Will Horton]] and [[Sonny Kiriakis]]; the station is owned by the [[Bonneville International|broadcasting arm]] of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]].<ref name=\"slt-ksl-gay-daytime-channel\">{{cite web|title=KSL won't be airing 'Days of Our Lives' during day |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002034629/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Nielsen ratings history===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2020}}\nEnd of season number of metered viewers (listed as a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] share in millions) and ranking (against other soap operas) from the first broadcast to the reporting week of August 24 to 28, 2015.\n{{main|List of US daytime soap opera ratings#1960s}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name=\"soapnet\">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = March 19, 2007 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time.

Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], Shane and Kimberly, and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = \"ratings\"/>\n\n===Best-remembered stories===\n<!-- These were a sampling of the most remembered story lines on Days, as referenced by SOAPnet.

Bell]], started writing for ''Days of Our Lives'' in 1966 and continued with the show until 1975, two years after he had created his own successful soap, ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', for rival network CBS. He continued with the show as a storyline consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many changes to the head writer position occurred. In the early 1980s, [[Margaret DePriest]] helped stabilize the show with her serial killer storyline. Later head writers, such as [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], built on that stability and crafted storylines of their own, temporarily helping to bringing up the program's ratings. Many head writer changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and the role would not become stable again until [[James E. Reilly]] joined the show in that role in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap ''[[Passions (TV series)|Passions]]'', when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens.

NBC regularly carried ''Days'' as well as its other daytime shows during the duration of its [[Olympic Games]] coverage from [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] until [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]]. Beginning in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], when NBC expanded its Olympics coverage to include additional events during its daytime schedule, the network began preempting ''Days'' (and then-stablemate ''Passions'') for the duration of the Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"wapo-takingdays\">{{cite news|title=Taking 'Days' From Daytime|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2004/08/13/taking-days-from-daytime/874b1b2f-a229-48ef-9656-74fbccd4a1d2/|author=Frank Ahrens|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnder an agreement reached with Sony Pictures Television in March 2004, cable network [[Soapnet]] began airing same-day rebroadcasts of ''Days of Our Lives'' each weeknight at 7:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (later 8:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. towa) [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] (with classic episodes sometimes filling the slot during NBC-predetermined preemptions), along with a (usually) five-hour-long weekend block of the past week's episodes; ''Days'' aired on the network until its closure in December 2013.<ref name=\"wapo-takingdays\"/> On August 24, 2015, [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]] began airing same-day rebroadcasts of the show as part of an early-prime-time soap opera repeat block that included CBS soaps ''The Young and the Restless'' and ''The Bold and the Beautiful''.

However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1968\u201369 television season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader CBS. By 1973, the show \u2013 pitted against CBS's popular ''[[Guiding Light]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/1:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|CT]]) \u2013<ref name=\"daytime\">{{cite web|title=NBC Daytime|url=http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|author=Curt Alliaume|website=Curt Alliaume's Utterly Irrelevant Web Site|accessdate=July 10, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020409024925/http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=April 9, 2002}}</ref> had matched the first-place ratings of ''As the World Turns'' and fellow NBC soap ''Another World''. Due to the success of the program, NBC expanded ''Days'' from a 30-minute timeslot to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975.<ref name=\"dayssummary\"/>  This expansion had followed the lead of ''Another World,'' which became the first hour-long television soap opera 3\u00bd months earlier on January 6. Furthermore, ''Days of Our Lives''{{'}} new starting time of 1:30&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/12:30 (CT)<ref name=\"daytime\"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the rights to the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'') to little to no success.\n\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC's daytime lineup proved to be short-lived, as viewership for ''Days of Our Lives'' began to decline in 1977. Much of this dropoff was associated with ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half-hour of ''Days of Our Lives'' and CBS' ''As The World Turns'' also airing at 1:30PM since it first premiered in April 1956. By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''All My Children'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00&nbsp;p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.\n\nBy 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''Another World'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. Overall though, the entire NBC soap lineup had been experiencing trouble maintaining ratings traction against their competitors on CBS and ABC. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The \"supercouple\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983\u201384 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. As ''Another World'' underwent its final ratings slump during the second half of the 1990s, many affiliates swapped the time slots of ''Another World'' and ''Days of Our Lives'', which usually aired an hour earlier.\nWhile individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of  television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network's direct affiliates.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not \"continue past 2009.\"<ref name=\"zucker\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007 | date=January 17, 2007}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show, which was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous \u2014 ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. \"Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It\". April 17, 2007.</ref>\n\n''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008\u20132009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18\u201349 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009\u20132010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name=\"Days of our Lives Renewed\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC \u2013 Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007|date=January 17, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308095643/http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever starting in 2011, while ABC canceled both ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'', ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18\u201349 women demographic. The cancellation of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again.

Since January 1993, after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' weekdays at 3:00&nbsp;p.m., while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Some [[Central Time Zone]] affiliates carry the program at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. in tandem with NBC's Eastern Time Zone feed; one example is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s [[WGBA-TV]], which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated [[local news]]cast against long-established local competition. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans.
