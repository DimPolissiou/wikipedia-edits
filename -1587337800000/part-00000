The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set, and the two plays directed by Alan Clarke in the ''Alan Clarke at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 79 surviving in the archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBC's.--> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 182 transmitted.\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the ''[[Radio Times]]''<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles billed as ''The Wednesday Play'' (or ''The Wednesday Play presenting: ...'') in the ''Radio Times'' listings for their first or a subsequent transmission are included, plus an additional two for the reasons given in the notes. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded, as are some additional repeats from ''[[Theatre 625]]'' shown in the Wednesday Play slot during 1968-69 but not billed as such in the ''Radio Times''. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1, with the introduction of colour from November 1969.\n\nThe archival status has been ascertained for almost all productions based on the BFI National Archive<ref>http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/</ref> and TV Brain<ref>https://www.tvbrain.info/</ref> online databases. Most of the extant versions are in the form of 16mm or 35mm black & white telerecordings (prints or negatives), or in a few cases original film versions where that was the original medium used for production. Some of the later plays exist in videotape formats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n! Producer (P) / Director (D)\n! Performers\n! Notes\n!

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B.

Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R.

Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set, and the two plays directed by Alan Clarke in the ''Alan Clarke at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 79 surviving in the archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBC's.--> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 182 transmitted.\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the ''[[Radio Times]]''<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles billed as ''The Wednesday Play'' (or ''The Wednesday Play presenting: ...'') in the ''Radio Times'' listings for their first or a subsequent transmission are included, plus an additional two for the reasons given in the notes. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded, as are some additional repeats from ''[[Theatre 625]]'' shown in the Wednesday Play slot during 1968-69 but not billed as such in the ''Radio Times''. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1, with the introduction of colour from November 1969.\n\nThe archival status has been ascertained for almost all productions based on the BFI National Archive<ref>http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/</ref> and TV Brain<ref>https://www.tvbrain.info/</ref> online databases. Most of the extant versions are in the form of 16mm or 35mm black & white telerecordings (prints or negatives), or in a few cases original film versions where that was the original medium used for production. Some of the later plays exist in videotape formats.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n! Producer (P) / Director (D)\n! Performers\n! Notes\n!

The reverse featured a bald eagle in flight clutching an [[American flag]].<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 66\u201367</ref>\n* '''1923''': Both the one-dollar [[United States Note]] and Silver Certificate were redesigned. Both notes featured the same reverse and an almost identical obverse with the same border design and portrait of George Washington. The only difference between the two notes was the color of ink used for the numeral 1 crossed by the word {{sc|DOLLAR}}, [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], and serial numbers along with the wording of the obligations. These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 59, 64</ref>\n\n===Small size notes===\n[[File:First Small Size Silver Certificate (face, 1928).jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 Silver Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $1 1928 Silver Certificate reverse.jpg|thumb|250px|Common reverse of $1 Silver Certificates (Series of 1928-1934) and $1 United States Notes ([[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]), commonly referred to as \"Funnybacks\"]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1928-Fr.1500.jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 United States Banknote printed.]]\n''(6.14 length \u00d7 2.61 width\u00d7 0.0043 in thickness  = 156 \u00d7 66.3 \u00d7 0.11&nbsp;mm)''\n\nIn 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] under [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 $1 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray {{sc|ONE}} replaced the blue \"{{small|1 DOLLAR}}.\" The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 $1 bill, but the center featured a large ornate {{sc|ONE}} superimposed by {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. These are commonly known as \"Funnybacks\" due to the rather odd-looking \"ONE\" on the reverse. These $1 silver certificates were issued until 1934.\n\nIn 1933, [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]] $1 [[United States Note]]s were issued to supplement the supply of $1 Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these $1 bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcurrencyvalues.com/1928_one_dollar_red_seal/|title=Series of 1928 One Dollar Red Seal United States Note \u2013 Values and Pricing - Sell Old Currency|website=OldCurrencyValues.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the design of the $1 silver certificate was changed.  This occurred with that year's passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2012/05/silver-purchase-act-of-1934-united.html|title=Encyclopedia of Money: Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (United States)|website=encyclopedia-of-money.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>  Under Washington's portrait, {{sc|ONE SILVER DOLLAR}} was changed to {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over {{sc|ONE}}, and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.\n\nA year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray {{sc|ONE}} to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by {{sc|WASHINGTON D.C.}}, and a stylized {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}} was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}.\n\n[[File:US $1 1935A North Africa Silver Certificate.jpg|thumb|250px|Special issue $1 Silver Certificate for Allied troops in North Africa]]\n\n[[World War II]] brought about [[Hawaii overprint note|special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.]]\nSpecial $1 Silver Certificates were issued for [[Hawaii]] in case of a Japanese invasion. {{sc|HAWAII}} was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe. The only difference on these one-dollar bills was a yellow instead of blue seal. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.\n\nThe next change came in 1957 when the $1 bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}; it was added over the word {{sc|ONE}} on the reverse. Initially the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto.\n\nThe final production of $1 Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.\n\nProduction of one-dollar [[Federal Reserve Note]]s was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete $1 Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word \"one,\" which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated.  The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe first change since then came in 1969, when the $1 was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new [[Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], with English wording instead of Latin.<ref>http://www.onedollarbill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nThe $1 bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas FRB]] was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/groups/f1988as.txt |title=data|website=uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n\nThough bill denominations of $5 and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the $1 or $2 bills.\n\n====Experimental issues====\n{{Main|Web notes}}\nSince 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.\n\nIn 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B\u2013B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.\n\nA better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red \"S\" to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red ''R''. Because they have some collector value, fake red S's and R's have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note's serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.\n\nSometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v15n22a21.html|title=THE GILBERT PAPER CO $1 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES, SERIES 1963|website=www.CoinBooks.org|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia FRB]] as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.\n\nIn August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond FRB]], with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (note that many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of $10 star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the $1.\n\nOne-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a [[Offset printing#Web-fed litho|web-fed]] [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/general/webs.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Web Notes|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The image from the dollar bill above shows the subject flipped horizontally for ease of comparison.]]\nThe portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A\u2013L), identifying it among the twelve [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal [[Federal Reserve System]] seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.\n\nTo the right of George Washington is the [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department seal]]\nThe scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n\nBelow the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the [[Treasurer of the United States]], and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s signature. To the left of the Secretary's signature is the [[Series (United States currency)|series]] date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note's appearance such as a new currency design.\n\nOn the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s.  A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If \"FW\" appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] facility in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. No \"FW\" means the bill was made at the main plant in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n==Reverse of current $1 bill==\n\n[[File:1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s conditional approval of the one-dollar bill's design in 1935, requiring that the appearance of the sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] be reversed, and together, captioned.]]\nThe reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to the left and right of the word ''ONE''. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and [[serif]]fed typeface. A smaller image of the word \"ONE\" is superimposed over the numeral \"1\" in each of the four corners of the bill.\n\n\"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" spans the top of the bill, \"ONE DOLLAR\" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central \"ONE\" are the words \"[[In God We Trust|IN GOD WE TRUST]],\" which became the official [[motto]] of the United States in 1956 by an [[Act of Congress]]. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words \"THE GREAT SEAL,\" and below the obverse on the right side are the words \"OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nThe Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill's design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.\n\nThe reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the [[Eye of Providence]] within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of [[American Revolution|American independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, \"[[Annuit c\u0153ptis|ANNUIT COEPTIS]],\" meaning \"He favors our undertaking.\" At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming \"[[Novus ordo seclorum|NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM]]\" meaning \"New Order of the Ages\" that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.\n\nThe obverse of the seal on the right features a [[bald eagle]], the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and symbol of the United States. Above the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a [[six-pointed star]]. The eagle's breast is covered by a [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the [[American flag]]. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"[[E pluribus unum|E PLURIBUS UNUM]]\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a ''de facto'' motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).  Both the phrases \"E Pluribus Unum\" and \"Annuit coeptis\" contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an [[olive branch]] with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.  A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==\nExcept for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (those from others are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value.  However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.\n\nIn 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas.  Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter \"K\", for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number \"11\" and a \"K\" surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot in Dallas in November 1963.  The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Kennedy-bills-have-eerie-connection-with-his-assassination-233045691.html|title=Kennedy bills have eerie connection with his assassination|first=NewsCenter16|last=Staff|website=WNDU.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968\u201369 [[Joseph W. Barr]] was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill.  Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed.  Thus they are very common.<ref>[https://www.papermoneyauction.com/rare-or-not-rare-the-1963-b-1-dollar-barr-note Rare or Not Rare: The 1963-B $1 Dollar Barr Note]</ref>\n\nDollar Bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or \u201cpalindrome\u201c notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same if you read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists.  Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number. The star designates that there was a printing error on one or more of the bills, and it has been replaced by one from a run specifically printed and numbered to be replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/why-do-some-us-bills-have-a-star-instead-of-a-letter-at-the-end-of-the-serial-number.htm|title=Why do some U.S. bills have a star instead of a letter at the end of the serial number?|website=www.howstuffworks.com|access-date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>  Star notes may have some additional value depending on their condition, their year series or if they have an unusual serial number sequence.  To determine the rarity of modern star notes, production tables are maintained.<ref>[http://www.mycurrencycollection.com/reference/star-notes/1 $1 Star Note Tables]</ref>\n\n== Prosecution for the possession of a $1 bill ==\nIn Turkey the possession of a one-dollar bill can lead to a prosecution and sentence for terror related charges because it is seen as evidence for being a member of the [[G\u00fclen movement|G\u00fclen Movement]] founded by [[Fethullah G\u00fclen]], which is seen as a terror organization in Turkey.

The obverse design of the dollar bill seen today debuted in 1963 (the reverse in 1935) when it was first issued as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] (previously, one dollar bills were [[Silver certificate (United States)|Silver Certificates]]).\n\nThe inclusion of the motto, \"[[In God We Trust]],\" on all currency was required by law in 1955, and first appeared on [[Banknote|paper money]] in 1957.\n\nThe [[Federal Reserve]] says the average life of a $1 bill in [[Circulation_(currency)|circulation]] is 5.8 years before it is replaced because of wear.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Federal Reserve|title=How long is the life span of U.S. paper money?|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-span-of-us-paper-money.htm}}</ref> Approximately 42% of all U.S. currency produced in 2009 were one-dollar bills.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing|title=1$ Note|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/small1denom.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216014938/http://www.moneyfactory.gov/small1denom.html|archivedate=2013-02-16}}</ref>\nAs of 2017, there were 12.1 billion one-dollar bills in circulation worldwide <ref>https://monstertubenetwork.com/hidden-facts-that-will-surprise-you-about-the-one-dollar-bill/</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Large size notes===\n\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1862-Fr-16c.jpg|thumb|250px|left|First $1 bill issued in 1862 as a Legal Tender Note]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1880-Fr-29.jpg|thumb|250px|Series 1880 $1 [[United States Note|Legal Tender]]]]\n[[File:US-$1-SC-1886-Fr-217.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Series of 1886 $1 Silver Certificate featuring [[Martha Washington]]]]\n[[File:US-$1-SC-1896-Fr-224-(3923429).jpg|thumb|250px|Famous 1896 \"[[Educational Series]]\" $1 Silver Certificate]]\n''({{small|approximately}} 7\u215c \u00d7 3\u215b in \u2245 187 \u00d7 79 &nbsp;mm)''\n* '''1862''': The first one-dollar bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note ([[United States Note]]) with a portrait of [[Salmon P.

The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of George Washington to the left and wording in the entire center. The reverse featured a bald eagle in flight clutching an [[American flag]].<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 66\u201367</ref>\n* '''1923''': Both the one-dollar [[United States Note]] and Silver Certificate were redesigned. Both notes featured the same reverse and an almost identical obverse with the same border design and portrait of George Washington. The only difference between the two notes was the color of ink used for the numeral 1 crossed by the word {{sc|DOLLAR}}, [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], and serial numbers along with the wording of the obligations. These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 59, 64</ref>\n\n===Small size notes===\n[[File:First Small Size Silver Certificate (face, 1928).jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 Silver Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $1 1928 Silver Certificate reverse.jpg|thumb|250px|Common reverse of $1 Silver Certificates (Series of 1928-1934) and $1 United States Notes ([[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]), commonly referred to as \"Funnybacks\"]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1928-Fr.1500.jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 United States Banknote printed.]]\n''(6.14 length \u00d7 2.61 width\u00d7 0.0043 in thickness  = 156 \u00d7 66.3 \u00d7 0.11&nbsp;mm)''\n\nIn 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] under [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 $1 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray {{sc|ONE}} replaced the blue \"{{small|1 DOLLAR}}.\" The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 $1 bill, but the center featured a large ornate {{sc|ONE}} superimposed by {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. These are commonly known as \"Funnybacks\" due to the rather odd-looking \"ONE\" on the reverse. These $1 silver certificates were issued until 1934.\n\nIn 1933, [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]] $1 [[United States Note]]s were issued to supplement the supply of $1 Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these $1 bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcurrencyvalues.com/1928_one_dollar_red_seal/|title=Series of 1928 One Dollar Red Seal United States Note \u2013 Values and Pricing - Sell Old Currency|website=OldCurrencyValues.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the design of the $1 silver certificate was changed.  This occurred with that year's passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2012/05/silver-purchase-act-of-1934-united.html|title=Encyclopedia of Money: Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (United States)|website=encyclopedia-of-money.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>  Under Washington's portrait, {{sc|ONE SILVER DOLLAR}} was changed to {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over {{sc|ONE}}, and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.\n\nA year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray {{sc|ONE}} to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by {{sc|WASHINGTON D.C.}}, and a stylized {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}} was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}.\n\n[[File:US $1 1935A North Africa Silver Certificate.jpg|thumb|250px|Special issue $1 Silver Certificate for Allied troops in North Africa]]\n\n[[World War II]] brought about [[Hawaii overprint note|special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.]]\nSpecial $1 Silver Certificates were issued for [[Hawaii]] in case of a Japanese invasion. {{sc|HAWAII}} was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe. The only difference on these one-dollar bills was a yellow instead of blue seal. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.\n\nThe next change came in 1957 when the $1 bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}; it was added over the word {{sc|ONE}} on the reverse. Initially the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto.\n\nThe final production of $1 Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.\n\nProduction of one-dollar [[Federal Reserve Note]]s was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete $1 Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word \"one,\" which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated.  The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe first change since then came in 1969, when the $1 was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new [[Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], with English wording instead of Latin.<ref>http://www.onedollarbill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nThe $1 bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas FRB]] was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/groups/f1988as.txt |title=data|website=uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n\nThough bill denominations of $5 and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the $1 or $2 bills.\n\n====Experimental issues====\n{{Main|Web notes}}\nSince 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.\n\nIn 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B\u2013B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.\n\nA better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red \"S\" to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red ''R''. Because they have some collector value, fake red S's and R's have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note's serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.\n\nSometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v15n22a21.html|title=THE GILBERT PAPER CO $1 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES, SERIES 1963|website=www.CoinBooks.org|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia FRB]] as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.\n\nIn August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond FRB]], with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (note that many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of $10 star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the $1.\n\nOne-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a [[Offset printing#Web-fed litho|web-fed]] [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/general/webs.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Web Notes|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The image from the dollar bill above shows the subject flipped horizontally for ease of comparison.]]\nThe portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A\u2013L), identifying it among the twelve [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal [[Federal Reserve System]] seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.\n\nTo the right of George Washington is the [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department seal]]\nThe scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n\nBelow the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the [[Treasurer of the United States]], and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s signature. To the left of the Secretary's signature is the [[Series (United States currency)|series]] date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note's appearance such as a new currency design.\n\nOn the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s.  A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If \"FW\" appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] facility in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. No \"FW\" means the bill was made at the main plant in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n==Reverse of current $1 bill==\n\n[[File:1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s conditional approval of the one-dollar bill's design in 1935, requiring that the appearance of the sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] be reversed, and together, captioned.]]\nThe reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to the left and right of the word ''ONE''. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and [[serif]]fed typeface. A smaller image of the word \"ONE\" is superimposed over the numeral \"1\" in each of the four corners of the bill.\n\n\"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" spans the top of the bill, \"ONE DOLLAR\" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central \"ONE\" are the words \"[[In God We Trust|IN GOD WE TRUST]],\" which became the official [[motto]] of the United States in 1956 by an [[Act of Congress]]. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words \"THE GREAT SEAL,\" and below the obverse on the right side are the words \"OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nThe Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill's design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.\n\nThe reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the [[Eye of Providence]] within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of [[American Revolution|American independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, \"[[Annuit c\u0153ptis|ANNUIT COEPTIS]],\" meaning \"He favors our undertaking.\" At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming \"[[Novus ordo seclorum|NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM]]\" meaning \"New Order of the Ages\" that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.\n\nThe obverse of the seal on the right features a [[bald eagle]], the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and symbol of the United States. Above the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a [[six-pointed star]]. The eagle's breast is covered by a [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the [[American flag]]. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"[[E pluribus unum|E PLURIBUS UNUM]]\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a ''de facto'' motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).  Both the phrases \"E Pluribus Unum\" and \"Annuit coeptis\" contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an [[olive branch]] with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.  A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==\nExcept for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (those from others are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value.  However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.\n\nIn 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas.  Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter \"K\", for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number \"11\" and a \"K\" surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot in Dallas in November 1963.  The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Kennedy-bills-have-eerie-connection-with-his-assassination-233045691.html|title=Kennedy bills have eerie connection with his assassination|first=NewsCenter16|last=Staff|website=WNDU.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968\u201369 [[Joseph W. Barr]] was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill.  Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed.  Thus they are very common.<ref>[https://www.papermoneyauction.com/rare-or-not-rare-the-1963-b-1-dollar-barr-note Rare or Not Rare: The 1963-B $1 Dollar Barr Note]</ref>\n\nDollar Bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or \u201cpalindrome\u201c notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same if you read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists.  Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number. The star designates that there was a printing error on one or more of the bills, and it has been replaced by one from a run specifically printed and numbered to be replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/why-do-some-us-bills-have-a-star-instead-of-a-letter-at-the-end-of-the-serial-number.htm|title=Why do some U.S. bills have a star instead of a letter at the end of the serial number?|website=www.howstuffworks.com|access-date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>  Star notes may have some additional value depending on their condition, their year series or if they have an unusual serial number sequence.  To determine the rarity of modern star notes, production tables are maintained.<ref>[http://www.mycurrencycollection.com/reference/star-notes/1 $1 Star Note Tables]</ref>\n\n== Prosecution for the possession of a $1 bill ==\nIn Turkey the possession of a one-dollar bill can lead to a prosecution and sentence for terror related charges because it is seen as evidence for being a member of the [[G\u00fclen movement|G\u00fclen Movement]] founded by [[Fethullah G\u00fclen]], which is seen as a terror organization in Turkey. Turkish authorities believe that G\u00fclen used to present a one dollar bill to his followers and that they showed it to one another in order to make them recognizable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/news/nasa-scientist-remains-trapped-in-turkish-prison-9645564|title=Over a Single Dollar Bill, a NASA Scientist Remains Trapped in a Turkish Prison|last=Wray|first=Dianna|date=2017-08-01|website=Houston Press|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2019/02/turkeys-war-against-one-dollar-us-bill-deemed-as-evidence-of-crime/|title=Turkey\u2019s war on the US one dollar bill to justify persecution of its critics|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/25/how-did-a-nasa-scientist-get-in-turkish-prison|title=How Did a NASA Scientist Get in Turkish Prison?|last=Snell|first=Lindsey|date=2017-03-25|access-date=2019-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Redesign or replacement of the dollar bill ==\n[[File:Figure 2 Estimated Cumulative Present-Value Net Loss to the Government from Actively and Gradually Replacing $1 Notes with $1 Coins over 30 Years (46756288014).jpg|thumb|[[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] estimated 30-year present-value cost of replacing $1 notes with $1 coins]]\n{{see also|Dollar coin (United States)#Popularity}}\n\nIn modern times, the one dollar bill is used much more than the [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar coin]], despite the U.S. Government's repeated efforts to promote the latter.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=CNN Money | url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/27/pf/new_dollar/ | title=Congress tries again for a dollar coin | first=Gordon T. | last=Anderson | date=April 25, 2005 | access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> There are organizations specifically aimed at either preventing ([[Save the Greenback]])<ref>\"Is U.S. Ready to See the Dollar Bill Pass?\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' June 12, 1995; p. 4</ref> or advocating ([[Coin Coalition]])<ref>Barro, Robert J. and Stevenson, Betsey: [http://home.manhattan.edu/~fiona.maclachlan/mb/coin.htm Do You Want That In Paper, or Metal?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041231164455/http://home.manhattan.edu/~fiona.maclachlan/mb/coin.htm |date=2004-12-31 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', November 6, 1997</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/04/11/pf/q_pennies/|title=Should the penny go? - Apr. 11, 2002|publisher=CNN|access-date=}}</ref> the complete elimination of the one-dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin.\n\nOn November 29, 2012, a [[United States House of Representatives|House]] subcommittee met to consider replacing the dollar bill.

Italian version of the city's name or the French ''Vienne''. The etymology of the city's name is still subject to scholarly dispute. Some claim that the name comes from ''vedunia'', meaning \"forest stream\", which subsequently produced the [[Old High German]] ''uuenia'' (''wenia'' in modern writing), the [[New High German]] ''wien'' and its dialectal variant ''wean''.<ref>Peter Csendes: ''Das Werden Wiens \u2013 Die siedlungsgeschichtlichen Grundlagen,'' in: id. and F.

The Irish monk [[Coloman of Stockerau|Saint Colman]] (or Koloman, Irish ''Colm\u00e1n'', derived from ''colm'' \"dove\") is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil ([[Vergilius of Salzburg|Virgil the Geometer]]) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of Vienna's great [[Schottenstift]] monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks.\n\n[[File:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|''Vienna from Belvedere'' by [[Bernardo Bellotto]], 1758]]\nIn 976 [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold I of Babenberg]] became count of the [[Bavarian Ostmark|Eastern March]], a 60-mile district centering on the [[Danube]] on the eastern frontier of [[Bavaria]]. This initial district grew into the [[Rulers of Austria|duchy of Austria]]. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1145 [[Henry II, Duke of Austria|Duke Henry II Jasomirgott]] moved the Babenberg family residence from [[Klosterneuburg]] in Lower Austria to Vienna. From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.<ref name=\"langelbach\">{{cite book|last= Lingelbach |first= William E. |title= The History of Nations: Austria-Hungary |publisher= P.

The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814/15. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Vienna remained the capital of what became the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The city functioned as a centre of classical music, for which the title of the [[First Viennese School]] (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied.\n\n[[File:Wien Burgtheater um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Colour lithograph of Vienna, 1900]]\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the [[bastion]]s and [[glacis]] into the [[Ringstra\u00dfe]], a new [[boulevard]] surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after [[World War I]], Vienna became capital of the [[Republic of German-Austria]], and then in 1919 of the [[First Republic of Austria]].\n\nFrom the late-19th century to 1938 the city remained a centre of high culture and of [[modernism]]. A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the [[Vienna Secession]] movement in art, [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Second Viennese School]] (Schoenberg and co.), the architecture of [[Adolf Loos]] and the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1913 [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] all lived within a few miles of each other in central Vienna, some of them becoming regulars at the same [[coffeehouse]]s.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21859771\n|title= 1913: When Hitler, Trotsky, Tito, Freud and Stalin all lived in the same place\n|website= BBC News|date= 18 April 2013|accessdate= 11 November 2013\n|quote= Freud's favourite haunt, the Cafe Landtmann, still stands on the Ring, the renowned boulevard which surrounds the city's historic Innere Stadt.<br /> Trotsky and Hitler frequented Cafe Central, just a few minutes' stroll away, where cakes, newspapers, chess and, above all, talk, were the patrons' passions.\n}}\n</ref>\nAustrians came to regard Vienna as a centre of [[socialist]] politics, sometimes referred to as \"[[Red Vienna]]\".

British and American air raids, and artillery duels between the Red Army and the [[SS]] and [[Wehrmacht]], crippled infrastructure, such as tram services and water and power distribution, and destroyed or damaged thousands of public and private buildings. Vienna fell eleven days later. At the end of the war, Austria was again separated from Germany, and Vienna was restored as the capital city of the republic, but the Soviet hold on the city remained until 1955, when Austria regained full sovereignty.\n\n=== Four-power Vienna ===\n{{further|Allied-occupied Austria}}\n[[File:Wien Besatzungszonen.png|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Occupation zones in Vienna, 1945\u201355]]\nAfter the war, Vienna was part of [[Occupation of Austria|Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria]] until September 1945. As in Berlin, Vienna in September 1945 was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the Soviet Union and supervised by an [[Allied Commission for Austria|Allied Commission]]. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an ''international zone'' in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The control was policed by the four powers on a ''de facto'' day-to-day basis, the famous \"four soldiers in a jeep\" method.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rMlnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22four+soldiers+in+a+jeep%22+vienna&dq=%22four+soldiers+in+a+jeep%22+vienna&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim5rzos-7KAhXCJJoKHRBNBNsQ6AEIMzAA ''Austria: Facts and Figures''], Federal Press Service, 1973, page 34</ref> The [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948 raised Western concerns that the Soviets might repeat the blockade in Vienna. The matter was raised in the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by MP [[Anthony Nutting]], who asked: \"What plans have the Government for dealing with a similar situation in Vienna? Vienna is in exactly a similar position to Berlin.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=HC Deb 30 June 1948 vol 452 cc2213-49|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/jun/30/germany#column_2238|website=Historic Hansard|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=17 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere was a lack of airfields in the Western sectors, and authorities drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade. Plans included the laying down of metal landing mats at Sch\u00f6nbrunn. The Soviets did not blockade the city. The [[Potsdam Agreement]] included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. Also, there was no precipitating event to cause a blockade in Vienna. (In Berlin, the Western powers had introduced a new currency in early 1948 to economically freeze out the Soviets.) During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna became a hotbed for international espionage between the [[Western bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern bloc]]s. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the [[Cold War]] in Vienna took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in Austria and Vienna. Here, the Soviet forces controlled districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21, and 22 and all areas incorporated into Vienna in 1938.\n\nBarbed wire fences were installed around the perimeter of [[West Berlin]] in 1953, but not in Vienna. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the [[Austrian State Treaty]], agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern Austria as well as their sector in Vienna. In exchange they required that Austria declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that Austria would not be a member of [[NATO]] and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between [[Italy]] and [[West Germany]].\n\nThe atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for [[Graham Greene]]'s screenplay for the film ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949). Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied Vienna is also depicted in the 1991 [[Philip Kerr]] novel, ''[[A German Requiem (novel)|A German Requiem]]''.\n\n=== Austrian State Treaty and afterwards ===\n[[File:Graben, szemben a Pestisoszlop. Fortepan 58901.jpg|thumb|Vienna in 1966]]\nThe four-power control of Vienna lasted until the [[Austrian State Treaty]] was signed in May 1955. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the [[Vienna State Opera|State Opera]] and the [[Burgtheater]], both on the Ringstra\u00dfe, reopened to the public. The Soviet Union signed the State Treaty only after having been provided with a political guarantee by the federal government to declare Austria's neutrality after the withdrawal of the allied troops. This law of neutrality, passed in late October 1955 (and not the State Treaty itself), ensured that modern Austria would align with neither [[NATO]] nor the [[Soviet bloc]], and is considered one of the reasons for Austria's delayed [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|entry into the European Union in 1995]].\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Chancellor of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] [[Bruno Kreisky]] inaugurated the [[Vienna International Centre]], a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organizations, such as the United Nations ([[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]], [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]), the [[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]], and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=none|cols=4\n|1637|60,000\n|1683|90,000\n|1710|113,800\n|1754|175,460\n|1783|247,753\n|1793|271,800\n|1830|401,200\n|1840|469,400\n|1850|551,300\n|1857|683,000\n|1869|900,998\n|1880|1,162,591\n|1890|1,430,213\n|1900|1,769,137\n|1910|2,083,630\n|1916|2,239,000\n|1923|1,918,720\n|1934|1,935,881\n|1939|1,770,938\n|1951|1,616,125\n|1961|1,627,566\n|1971|1,619,885\n|1981|1,535,145\n|1990|1,492,636\n|2000|1,548,537\n|2010|1,689,995\n|2018|1,897,491\n|footnote=2019 data<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=080904|title=Statistik Austria - Bev\u00f6lkerung zu Jahresbeginn 2002-2019 nach Gemeinden (Gebietsstand 1.1.2019)}}</ref>\n}}\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | Significant foreign resident groups<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch der Stadt Wien 2014|url=https://www.wien.gv.at/statistik/publikationen/jahrbuch.html|publisher=Stadt Wien|accessdate=31 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202031628/http://www.wien.gv.at/statistik/publikationen/jahrbuch.html|archivedate=2 February 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Administrative district offices in Vienna (called Magistratische Bezirks\u00e4mter) serve functions similar to those in the other Austrian states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften), the officers being subject to the mayor of Vienna; with the notable exception of the police, which is under federal supervision.\n\nDistrict residents in Vienna (Austrians as well as EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a District Assembly (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councillor (amtsf\u00fchrender Stadtrat).\n\n[[File:Opera-Vienna-Austria-2005.jpg|thumb|left|Albertina Terrace in the [[Innere Stadt]]]]\n\nThe heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today's [[Innere Stadt]], was a fortress surrounded by fields in order to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, Vienna with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages,<ref>[[Felix Czeike]]: ''Historisches Lexikon Wien'', volume 5, Kremayr & Scheriau, Vienna 1997, {{ISBN|3-218-00547-7}}, p. 289</ref> called Vorst\u00e4dte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently, the walls were razed after 1857,<ref>Decision of Emperor Franz Joseph I, published in the official newspaper \u2018\u2018Wiener Zeitung\u2019\u2019 on 25 December 1857, p. 1</ref> making it possible for the city centre to expand.\n\nIn their place, a broad boulevard called the [[Ringstra\u00dfe]] was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the [[Rathaus, Vienna|Rathaus]] (town hall), the [[Burgtheater]], the [[University of Vienna|University]], the [[Parliament of Austria|Parliament]], the twin museums of [[Naturhistorisches Museum|natural history]] and [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|fine art]], and the [[Vienna State Opera|Staatsoper]]. It is also the location of New Wing of the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]], the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Stephansdom]] is located at the centre of the city, on [[Stephansplatz, Vienna|Stephansplatz]]. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works.\n\n[[File:Ringlinien08.JPG|thumb|right|The Ring Road (Ringstra\u00dfe) with a historical tram]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called ''[[Linienwall]]'' at which a [[road toll (historic)|road toll]] called the ''[[Liniengeld]]'' was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a [[beltway|ring road]] called [[G\u00fcrtel, Vienna|G\u00fcrtel]] was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892<ref name=vol5p290>Czeike, volume 5, p. 290</ref> and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894.<ref>Czeike, volume 4, Vienna 1995, {{ISBN|3-218-00546-9}}, p. 69</ref> In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.\n\nFrom 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the right bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868\u20131875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938 the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding [[Lower Austria]] in 1954.<ref name=vol5p290 /> Since then Vienna has 23 districts.\n\nIndustries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The [[Innere Stadt]] is situated away from the main flow of the [[Danube]], but is bounded by the ''[[Donaukanal]]'' (\"Danube canal\"). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the [[Danube]] River. Across the Danube, where the [[Vienna International Centre]] is located (districts 21\u201322), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.\n\n== Politics ==\n===Political history===\n[[File:Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses, Parlament, Wien.jpg|thumb|The Debating Chamber of the former House of Deputies of Austria in the [[Austrian Parliament Building|parliament]]]]\nIn the twenty years before the First World War and until 1918, Viennese politics were shaped by the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]]. In particular, long-term mayor [[Karl Lueger]] was able to not apply the general voting rights for men introduced by and for the parliament of imperial Austria, the ''Reichsrat'', in 1907, thereby excluding most of the working class from taking part in decisions. For [[Adolf Hitler]], who spent some years in Vienna, Lueger was a teacher of how to use [[antisemitism]] in politics.\n\nVienna is today considered the center of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6). During the period of the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]] (1918\u20131934), the Vienna Social Democrats undertook many social reforms. At that time, Vienna's municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as \"[[Red Vienna]]\" (''Rotes Wien''). In February 1934 troops of the Austrian federal government under [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], who had closed down the first chamber of the federal parliament, the ''Nationalrat'', in 1933, and paramilitary socialist organisations were engaged in the Austrian Civil War, which led to the ban of the Social Democratic party.\n\nThe SP\u00d6 has held the mayor's office and control of the city council/parliament at every free election since 1919. The only break in this SP\u00d6 dominance came between 1934 and 1945, when the Social Democratic Party was illegal, mayors were appointed by the [[Austrofascism|austro-fascist]] and later by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] authorities. The current mayor of Vienna is [[Michael Ludwig (politician)|Michael Ludwig]] of the SP\u00d6.\n\nThe city has enacted many social democratic policies. The ''[[Gemeindebau]]ten'' are social housing assets that are well integrated into the city architecture outside the first or \"inner\" district. The low rents enable comfortable accommodation and good access to the city amenities. Many of the projects were built after the [[World War II|Second World War]] on vacant lots that were destroyed by bombing during the war. The city took particular pride in building them to a high standard.\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna}}\n[[File:Rathaus Wien Stiege 2.JPG|thumb|right|Interior of Vienna's historical [[Vienna City Hall|Rathaus]], the seat of city mayor]]\nSince Vienna obtained federal state (''Bundesland'') status of its own by the federal constitution of 1920, the city council also functions as the state parliament ([[Landtag]]), and the mayor (except 1934\u20131945) also doubles as the ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'' (governor/minister-president) of the state of Vienna. The Rathaus accommodates the offices of the mayor (''[[:de:Magistrat der Stadt Wien]]'') and the state government (''Landesregierung''). The city is administered by a multitude of departments (''Magistratsabteilungen''), politically supervised by ''amtsf\u00fchrende Stadtr\u00e4te'' (members of the city government leading offices; according to the Vienna constitution opposition parties have the right to designate members of the city government not leading offices).\n\nUnder the city constitution of 1920, municipal and state business must be kept separate. Hence, the city council and state parliament hold separate meetings, with separate presiding officers\u2013the chairman of the city council or the president of the state Landtag\u2013even though the two bodies' memberships are identical. When meeting as a city council, the deputies can only deal with the affairs of the city of Vienna; when meeting as a state parliament, they can only deal with the affairs of the state of Vienna.\n\nIn the 1996 City Council election, the SP\u00d6 lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SP\u00d6 had held an outright majority at every free municipal election since 1919. In 1996 the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6), which won 29 seats (up from 21 in 1991), beat the \u00d6VP into third place for the second time running. From 1996\u20132001, the SP\u00d6 governed Vienna in a coalition with the \u00d6VP. In 2001 the SP\u00d6 regained the overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote; in October 2005 this majority was increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). In course of the 2010 city council elections the SP\u00d6 lost their overall majority again and consequently forged a coalition with the [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]] \u2013 the first SP\u00d6/Green coalition in Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orf.at/stories/2025548/ |title=Pakt unterzeichnet: Rot-Gr\u00fcn in Wien nun offiziell \u2013 news.ORF.at |publisher=Orf.at |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref> This coalition was maintained following the 2015 election.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Messe Wien 01.jpg|thumb|Messe Wien Congress Center]]\n[[File:Wien - Austria Center.JPG|thumb|Austria Center Vienna (ACV)]]\nVienna is one of the wealthiest regions in the [[European Union]]: Its [[gross regional product]] of EUR 47,200 per capita constituted 25.7% of Austria's GDP in 2013.

Styles range from [[classicism|classicist]] buildings to [[modern architecture]]. [[Art Nouveau]] left many architectural traces in Vienna. The [[Secession Building, Vienna|Secession building]], [[Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station]], and the [[Kirche am Steinhof]] by [[Otto Wagner]] rank among the best known examples of Art Nouveau in the world. Wagner's prominent student [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]] from [[Slovenia]] also left important traces in Vienna. His works include the Langer House (1900) and the [[Zacherlhaus]] (1903\u20131905). Ple\u010dnik's 1910\u20131913 ''Church of the Holy Spirit'' ({{illm|Heilig-Geist-Kirche|de|Heilig-Geist-Kirche (Wien)}}) in Vienna is remarkable for its innovative use of poured-in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church's crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases.\n\nConcurrent to the Art Nouveau movement was the [[Wiener Moderne]], during which some architects shunned the use of extraneous adornment. A key architect of this period was [[Adolf Loos]], whose works include the Looshaus (1909), the K\u00e4rntner Bar or American Bar (1908) and the [[Steiner House]] (1910).\n\nThe [[Hundertwasserhaus]] by [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], designed to counter the clinical look of modern architecture, is one of Vienna's most popular [[tourist attraction]]s. Another example of unique architecture is the [[Wotruba Church|Wotrubakirche]] by sculptor [[Fritz Wotruba]]. In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around Donaustadt (north of the Danube) and Wienerberg (in southern Vienna).\n\n[[File:Stephansdom Vienna July 2008 (27)-Stephansdom Vienna July 2008 (31).jpg|thumb|View of the city from Stephansdom]]\nThe 220-meter high [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]] located on the Northern bank of the Danube, completed in 2013, is the tallest skyscraper in Vienna.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscraperpicture.com/vienna.htm |title=Vienna's 10 tallest skyscrapers |publisher=Skyscraperpicture.com |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130015638/http://skyscraperpicture.com/vienna.htm |archivedate=30 November 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=millenniumtower-vienna-austria |title=Millennium Tower &#124; Buildings |location=Vienna / |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> In recent years, Vienna has seen numerous architecture projects completed which combine modern architectural elements with old buildings, such as the remodelling and revitalisation of the old [[Gasometer, Vienna|Gasometer]] in 2001.\nMost buildings in Vienna are relatively low; in early 2006 there were around 100 buildings higher than {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

It is available in almost every restaurant that serves [[Viennese cuisine]] and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include ''[[Tafelspitz]]'' (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with ''Ger\u00f6stete Erd\u00e4pfel'' (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, ''Apfelkren'' (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and ''Schnittlauchsauce'' (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Wiener Schnitzel]]'']]\n\nVienna has a long tradition of producing cakes and desserts. These include ''[[Apple strudel|Apfelstrudel]]'' (hot apple strudel), ''[[Milchrahmstrudel]]'' (milk-cream strudel), ''[[Palatschinken]]'' (sweet pancakes), and ''Kn\u00f6del'' (dumplings) often filled with fruit such as apricots (''[[Marillenkn\u00f6del]]''). [[Sachertorte]], a delicately moist chocolate cake with apricot jam created by the [[Hotel Sacher|Sacher Hotel]], is world-famous.\n\nIn winter, small street stands sell traditional ''[[Chestnut|Maroni]]'' (hot chestnuts) and potato fritters.\n\nSausages are popular and available from street vendors (''[[W\u00fcrstelstand]]'') throughout the day and into the night. The sausage known as ''[[Frankfurter W\u00fcrstchen|Wiener]]'' (German for Viennese) in the U.S. and in Germany, is called a ''Frankfurter'' in Vienna. Other popular sausages are ''Burenwurst'' (a coarse beef and pork sausage, generally boiled), ''[[Kranjska klobasa|K\u00e4sekrainer]]'' (spicy pork with small chunks of cheese), and ''[[Bratwurst]]'' (a white pork sausage). Most can be ordered \"mit Brot\" (with bread) or as a \"hot dog\" (stuffed inside a long roll). Mustard is the traditional condiment and usually offered in two varieties: \"s\u00fc\u00df\" (sweet) or \"scharf\" (spicy).\n\nKebab, pizza and noodles are, increasingly, the snack foods most widely available from small stands.\n\nThe ''[[Naschmarkt]]'' is a permanent market for fruit, vegetables, spices, fish, meat, etc., from around the world. The city has many coffee and breakfast stores.\n\n=== Drinks ===\n[[File:Wien Heurigen-Lokal 2014 1.jpg|thumb|A typical Heurigen-Restaurant in Grinzing]]\nVienna, along with [[Paris]], [[Santiago]], [[Cape Town]], [[Prague]], [[Canberra]], [[Bratislava]] and [[Warsaw]], is one of the few remaining world capital cities with its own vineyards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austria.info/uk/things-to-do/food-and-drink/wine/vienna-the-wine-capital|title=Vienna: The Wine Capital|website=www.austria.info|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref> The wine is served in small Viennese pubs known as [[Heuriger]], which are especially numerous in the wine growing areas of [[D\u00f6bling]] ([[Grinzing]], [[Neustift am Walde]], [[Nu\u00dfdorf, Vienna|Nu\u00dfdorf]], [[Salmannsdorf]], [[Sievering]]), [[Floridsdorf]] (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), [[Liesing]] ([[Mauer, Vienna|Mauer]]) and Favoriten (Oberlaa). The wine is often drunk as a Spritzer (\"G'spritzter\") with sparkling water. The [[Gr\u00fcner Veltliner]], a dry white wine, is the most widely cultivated wine in Austria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |title=Gruner Veltliner Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}</ref>\n\nBeer is next in importance to wine. Vienna has a single large brewery, [[Brauerei Ottakringer|Ottakringer]], and more than ten [[Vienna microbreweries|microbreweries]]. A \"Beisl\" is a typical small Austrian pub, of which Vienna has many.\n\nAlso, local soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages, placing it on the top spots along American counterparts such as [[Coca-Cola]] in terms of market share. Another popular drink is the so-called \"[[Spezi]]\", a mix between [[Coca-Cola]] and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]].\n\n=== Viennese caf\u00e9s ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Kara Mustafa]] -->\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 Demel interior4, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|''Demel Caf\u00e9'']]\n[[Viennese caf\u00e9]]s have an extremely long and distinguished history that dates back centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider caf\u00e9s as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes with a glass of water. Viennese caf\u00e9s claim to have invented the process of [[drip brew|filtering coffee]] from booty captured after the second [[Battle of Vienna|Turkish siege]] in 1683. Viennese caf\u00e9s claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of [[coffee]] beans. The [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish]] King [[John III Sobieski]], the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave [[Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki|Franz George Kolschitzky]] (Polish \u2013 [[Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki|Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki]]) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]. [[Julius Meinl]] set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n{{further|Tourist attractions in Vienna}}\nMajor tourist attractions include the imperial palaces of the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]] and [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] (also home to the world's oldest zoo, [[Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn]]) and the [[Wiener Riesenrad|Riesenrad]] in the Prater.

Italian version of the city's name or the French ''Vienne''. The etymology of the city's name is still subject to scholarly dispute. Some claim that the name comes from ''vedunia'', meaning \"forest stream\", which subsequently produced the [[Old High German]] ''uuenia'' (''wenia'' in modern writing), the [[New High German]] ''wien'' and its dialectal variant ''wean''.<ref>Peter Csendes: ''Das Werden Wiens \u2013 Die siedlungsgeschichtlichen Grundlagen,'' in: id. and F.

The Irish monk [[Coloman of Stockerau|Saint Colman]] (or Koloman, Irish ''Colm\u00e1n'', derived from ''colm'' \"dove\") is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil ([[Vergilius of Salzburg|Virgil the Geometer]]) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of Vienna's great [[Schottenstift]] monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks.\n\n[[File:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|''Vienna from Belvedere'' by [[Bernardo Bellotto]], 1758]]\nIn 976 [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold I of Babenberg]] became count of the [[Bavarian Ostmark|Eastern March]], a 60-mile district centering on the [[Danube]] on the eastern frontier of [[Bavaria]]. This initial district grew into the [[Rulers of Austria|duchy of Austria]]. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1145 [[Henry II, Duke of Austria|Duke Henry II Jasomirgott]] moved the Babenberg family residence from [[Klosterneuburg]] in Lower Austria to Vienna. From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.<ref name=\"langelbach\">{{cite book|last= Lingelbach |first= William E. |title= The History of Nations: Austria-Hungary |publisher= P.

[[Hungary]] occupied the city between 1485 and 1490.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries Christian forces twice stopped [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies outside Vienna (see [[Siege of Vienna]], 1529 and [[Battle of Vienna]], 1683).

The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814/15. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Vienna remained the capital of what became the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The city functioned as a centre of classical music, for which the title of the [[First Viennese School]] (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied.\n\n[[File:Wien Burgtheater um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Colour lithograph of Vienna, 1900]]\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the [[bastion]]s and [[glacis]] into the [[Ringstra\u00dfe]], a new [[boulevard]] surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after [[World War I]], Vienna became capital of the [[Republic of German-Austria]], and then in 1919 of the [[First Republic of Austria]].\n\nFrom the late-19th century to 1938 the city remained a centre of high culture and of [[modernism]]. A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the [[Vienna Secession]] movement in art, [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Second Viennese School]] (Schoenberg and co.), the architecture of [[Adolf Loos]] and the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1913 [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] all lived within a few miles of each other in central Vienna, some of them becoming regulars at the same [[coffeehouse]]s.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21859771\n|title= 1913: When Hitler, Trotsky, Tito, Freud and Stalin all lived in the same place\n|website= BBC News|date= 18 April 2013|accessdate= 11 November 2013\n|quote= Freud's favourite haunt, the Cafe Landtmann, still stands on the Ring, the renowned boulevard which surrounds the city's historic Innere Stadt.<br /> Trotsky and Hitler frequented Cafe Central, just a few minutes' stroll away, where cakes, newspapers, chess and, above all, talk, were the patrons' passions.\n}}\n</ref>\nAustrians came to regard Vienna as a centre of [[socialist]] politics, sometimes referred to as \"[[Red Vienna]]\".

British and American air raids, and artillery duels between the Red Army and the [[SS]] and [[Wehrmacht]], crippled infrastructure, such as tram services and water and power distribution, and destroyed or damaged thousands of public and private buildings. Vienna fell eleven days later. At the end of the war, Austria was again separated from Germany, and Vienna was restored as the capital city of the republic, but the Soviet hold on the city remained until 1955, when Austria regained full sovereignty.\n\n=== Four-power Vienna ===\n{{further|Allied-occupied Austria}}\n[[File:Wien Besatzungszonen.png|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Occupation zones in Vienna, 1945\u201355]]\nAfter the war, Vienna was part of [[Occupation of Austria|Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria]] until September 1945. As in Berlin, Vienna in September 1945 was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the Soviet Union and supervised by an [[Allied Commission for Austria|Allied Commission]]. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an ''international zone'' in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The control was policed by the four powers on a ''de facto'' day-to-day basis, the famous \"four soldiers in a jeep\" method.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rMlnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22four+soldiers+in+a+jeep%22+vienna&dq=%22four+soldiers+in+a+jeep%22+vienna&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim5rzos-7KAhXCJJoKHRBNBNsQ6AEIMzAA ''Austria: Facts and Figures''], Federal Press Service, 1973, page 34</ref> The [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948 raised Western concerns that the Soviets might repeat the blockade in Vienna. The matter was raised in the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by MP [[Anthony Nutting]], who asked: \"What plans have the Government for dealing with a similar situation in Vienna? Vienna is in exactly a similar position to Berlin.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=HC Deb 30 June 1948 vol 452 cc2213-49|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/jun/30/germany#column_2238|website=Historic Hansard|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=17 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere was a lack of airfields in the Western sectors, and authorities drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade. Plans included the laying down of metal landing mats at Sch\u00f6nbrunn. The Soviets did not blockade the city. The [[Potsdam Agreement]] included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. Also, there was no precipitating event to cause a blockade in Vienna. (In Berlin, the Western powers had introduced a new currency in early 1948 to economically freeze out the Soviets.) During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna became a hotbed for international espionage between the [[Western bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern bloc]]s. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the [[Cold War]] in Vienna took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in Austria and Vienna. Here, the Soviet forces controlled districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21, and 22 and all areas incorporated into Vienna in 1938.\n\nBarbed wire fences were installed around the perimeter of [[West Berlin]] in 1953, but not in Vienna. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the [[Austrian State Treaty]], agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern Austria as well as their sector in Vienna. In exchange they required that Austria declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that Austria would not be a member of [[NATO]] and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between [[Italy]] and [[West Germany]].\n\nThe atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for [[Graham Greene]]'s screenplay for the film ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949). Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied Vienna is also depicted in the 1991 [[Philip Kerr]] novel, ''[[A German Requiem (novel)|A German Requiem]]''.\n\n=== Austrian State Treaty and afterwards ===\n[[File:Graben, szemben a Pestisoszlop. Fortepan 58901.jpg|thumb|Vienna in 1966]]\nThe four-power control of Vienna lasted until the [[Austrian State Treaty]] was signed in May 1955. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the [[Vienna State Opera|State Opera]] and the [[Burgtheater]], both on the Ringstra\u00dfe, reopened to the public. The Soviet Union signed the State Treaty only after having been provided with a political guarantee by the federal government to declare Austria's neutrality after the withdrawal of the allied troops. This law of neutrality, passed in late October 1955 (and not the State Treaty itself), ensured that modern Austria would align with neither [[NATO]] nor the [[Soviet bloc]], and is considered one of the reasons for Austria's delayed [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|entry into the European Union in 1995]].\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Chancellor of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] [[Bruno Kreisky]] inaugurated the [[Vienna International Centre]], a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organizations, such as the United Nations ([[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]], [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]), the [[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]], and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=none|cols=4\n|1637|60,000\n|1683|90,000\n|1710|113,800\n|1754|175,460\n|1783|247,753\n|1793|271,800\n|1830|401,200\n|1840|469,400\n|1850|551,300\n|1857|683,000\n|1869|900,998\n|1880|1,162,591\n|1890|1,430,213\n|1900|1,769,137\n|1910|2,083,630\n|1916|2,239,000\n|1923|1,918,720\n|1934|1,935,881\n|1939|1,770,938\n|1951|1,616,125\n|1961|1,627,566\n|1971|1,619,885\n|1981|1,535,145\n|1990|1,492,636\n|2000|1,548,537\n|2010|1,689,995\n|2018|1,897,491\n|footnote=2019 data<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_NATIVE_FILE&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&dDocName=080904|title=Statistik Austria - Bev\u00f6lkerung zu Jahresbeginn 2002-2019 nach Gemeinden (Gebietsstand 1.1.2019)}}</ref>\n}}\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | Significant foreign resident groups<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch der Stadt Wien 2014|url=https://www.wien.gv.at/statistik/publikationen/jahrbuch.html|publisher=Stadt Wien|accessdate=31 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202031628/http://www.wien.gv.at/statistik/publikationen/jahrbuch.html|archivedate=2 February 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Administrative district offices in Vienna (called Magistratische Bezirks\u00e4mter) serve functions similar to those in the other Austrian states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften), the officers being subject to the mayor of Vienna; with the notable exception of the police, which is under federal supervision.\n\nDistrict residents in Vienna (Austrians as well as EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a District Assembly (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councillor (amtsf\u00fchrender Stadtrat).\n\n[[File:Opera-Vienna-Austria-2005.jpg|thumb|left|Albertina Terrace in the [[Innere Stadt]]]]\n\nThe heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today's [[Innere Stadt]], was a fortress surrounded by fields in order to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, Vienna with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages,<ref>[[Felix Czeike]]: ''Historisches Lexikon Wien'', volume 5, Kremayr & Scheriau, Vienna 1997, {{ISBN|3-218-00547-7}}, p. 289</ref> called Vorst\u00e4dte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently, the walls were razed after 1857,<ref>Decision of Emperor Franz Joseph I, published in the official newspaper \u2018\u2018Wiener Zeitung\u2019\u2019 on 25 December 1857, p. 1</ref> making it possible for the city centre to expand.\n\nIn their place, a broad boulevard called the [[Ringstra\u00dfe]] was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the [[Rathaus, Vienna|Rathaus]] (town hall), the [[Burgtheater]], the [[University of Vienna|University]], the [[Parliament of Austria|Parliament]], the twin museums of [[Naturhistorisches Museum|natural history]] and [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|fine art]], and the [[Vienna State Opera|Staatsoper]]. It is also the location of New Wing of the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]], the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Stephansdom]] is located at the centre of the city, on [[Stephansplatz, Vienna|Stephansplatz]]. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works.\n\n[[File:Ringlinien08.JPG|thumb|right|The Ring Road (Ringstra\u00dfe) with a historical tram]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called ''[[Linienwall]]'' at which a [[road toll (historic)|road toll]] called the ''[[Liniengeld]]'' was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a [[beltway|ring road]] called [[G\u00fcrtel, Vienna|G\u00fcrtel]] was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892<ref name=vol5p290>Czeike, volume 5, p. 290</ref> and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894.<ref>Czeike, volume 4, Vienna 1995, {{ISBN|3-218-00546-9}}, p. 69</ref> In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.\n\nFrom 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the right bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868\u20131875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938 the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding [[Lower Austria]] in 1954.<ref name=vol5p290 /> Since then Vienna has 23 districts.\n\nIndustries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The [[Innere Stadt]] is situated away from the main flow of the [[Danube]], but is bounded by the ''[[Donaukanal]]'' (\"Danube canal\"). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the [[Danube]] River. Across the Danube, where the [[Vienna International Centre]] is located (districts 21\u201322), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.\n\n== Politics ==\n===Political history===\n[[File:Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses, Parlament, Wien.jpg|thumb|The Debating Chamber of the former House of Deputies of Austria in the [[Austrian Parliament Building|parliament]]]]\nIn the twenty years before the First World War and until 1918, Viennese politics were shaped by the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]]. In particular, long-term mayor [[Karl Lueger]] was able to not apply the general voting rights for men introduced by and for the parliament of imperial Austria, the ''Reichsrat'', in 1907, thereby excluding most of the working class from taking part in decisions. For [[Adolf Hitler]], who spent some years in Vienna, Lueger was a teacher of how to use [[antisemitism]] in politics.\n\nVienna is today considered the center of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6). During the period of the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]] (1918\u20131934), the Vienna Social Democrats undertook many social reforms. At that time, Vienna's municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as \"[[Red Vienna]]\" (''Rotes Wien''). In February 1934 troops of the Austrian federal government under [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], who had closed down the first chamber of the federal parliament, the ''Nationalrat'', in 1933, and paramilitary socialist organisations were engaged in the Austrian Civil War, which led to the ban of the Social Democratic party.\n\nThe SP\u00d6 has held the mayor's office and control of the city council/parliament at every free election since 1919. The only break in this SP\u00d6 dominance came between 1934 and 1945, when the Social Democratic Party was illegal, mayors were appointed by the [[Austrofascism|austro-fascist]] and later by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] authorities. The current mayor of Vienna is [[Michael Ludwig (politician)|Michael Ludwig]] of the SP\u00d6.\n\nThe city has enacted many social democratic policies. The ''[[Gemeindebau]]ten'' are social housing assets that are well integrated into the city architecture outside the first or \"inner\" district. The low rents enable comfortable accommodation and good access to the city amenities. Many of the projects were built after the [[World War II|Second World War]] on vacant lots that were destroyed by bombing during the war. The city took particular pride in building them to a high standard.\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna}}\n[[File:Rathaus Wien Stiege 2.JPG|thumb|right|Interior of Vienna's historical [[Vienna City Hall|Rathaus]], the seat of city mayor]]\nSince Vienna obtained federal state (''Bundesland'') status of its own by the federal constitution of 1920, the city council also functions as the state parliament ([[Landtag]]), and the mayor (except 1934\u20131945) also doubles as the ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'' (governor/minister-president) of the state of Vienna. The Rathaus accommodates the offices of the mayor (''[[:de:Magistrat der Stadt Wien]]'') and the state government (''Landesregierung''). The city is administered by a multitude of departments (''Magistratsabteilungen''), politically supervised by ''amtsf\u00fchrende Stadtr\u00e4te'' (members of the city government leading offices; according to the Vienna constitution opposition parties have the right to designate members of the city government not leading offices).\n\nUnder the city constitution of 1920, municipal and state business must be kept separate. Hence, the city council and state parliament hold separate meetings, with separate presiding officers\u2013the chairman of the city council or the president of the state Landtag\u2013even though the two bodies' memberships are identical. When meeting as a city council, the deputies can only deal with the affairs of the city of Vienna; when meeting as a state parliament, they can only deal with the affairs of the state of Vienna.\n\nIn the 1996 City Council election, the SP\u00d6 lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SP\u00d6 had held an outright majority at every free municipal election since 1919. In 1996 the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6), which won 29 seats (up from 21 in 1991), beat the \u00d6VP into third place for the second time running. From 1996\u20132001, the SP\u00d6 governed Vienna in a coalition with the \u00d6VP. In 2001 the SP\u00d6 regained the overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote; in October 2005 this majority was increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). In course of the 2010 city council elections the SP\u00d6 lost their overall majority again and consequently forged a coalition with the [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Green Party]] \u2013 the first SP\u00d6/Green coalition in Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orf.at/stories/2025548/ |title=Pakt unterzeichnet: Rot-Gr\u00fcn in Wien nun offiziell \u2013 news.ORF.at |publisher=Orf.at |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref> This coalition was maintained following the 2015 election.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Messe Wien 01.jpg|thumb|Messe Wien Congress Center]]\n[[File:Wien - Austria Center.JPG|thumb|Austria Center Vienna (ACV)]]\nVienna is one of the wealthiest regions in the [[European Union]]: Its [[gross regional product]] of EUR 47,200 per capita constituted 25.7% of Austria's GDP in 2013.

Since 2012 Theater an der Wien has taken over the Wiener Kammeroper, a historical small theatre in the first district of Vienna seating 300 spectators, turning it into its second venue for smaller sized productions and chamber operas created by the young ensemble of Theater an der Wien (JET). Before 2005 the most successful musical was ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]'', which was later translated into several languages and performed all over the world.

Styles range from [[classicism|classicist]] buildings to [[modern architecture]]. [[Art Nouveau]] left many architectural traces in Vienna. The [[Secession Building, Vienna|Secession building]], [[Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station]], and the [[Kirche am Steinhof]] by [[Otto Wagner]] rank among the best known examples of Art Nouveau in the world. Wagner's prominent student [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]] from [[Slovenia]] also left important traces in Vienna. His works include the Langer House (1900) and the [[Zacherlhaus]] (1903\u20131905). Ple\u010dnik's 1910\u20131913 ''Church of the Holy Spirit'' ({{illm|Heilig-Geist-Kirche|de|Heilig-Geist-Kirche (Wien)}}) in Vienna is remarkable for its innovative use of poured-in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church's crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases.\n\nConcurrent to the Art Nouveau movement was the [[Wiener Moderne]], during which some architects shunned the use of extraneous adornment. A key architect of this period was [[Adolf Loos]], whose works include the Looshaus (1909), the K\u00e4rntner Bar or American Bar (1908) and the [[Steiner House]] (1910).\n\nThe [[Hundertwasserhaus]] by [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], designed to counter the clinical look of modern architecture, is one of Vienna's most popular [[tourist attraction]]s. Another example of unique architecture is the [[Wotruba Church|Wotrubakirche]] by sculptor [[Fritz Wotruba]]. In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around Donaustadt (north of the Danube) and Wienerberg (in southern Vienna).\n\n[[File:Stephansdom Vienna July 2008 (27)-Stephansdom Vienna July 2008 (31).jpg|thumb|View of the city from Stephansdom]]\nThe 220-meter high [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]] located on the Northern bank of the Danube, completed in 2013, is the tallest skyscraper in Vienna.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscraperpicture.com/vienna.htm |title=Vienna's 10 tallest skyscrapers |publisher=Skyscraperpicture.com |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130015638/http://skyscraperpicture.com/vienna.htm |archivedate=30 November 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=millenniumtower-vienna-austria |title=Millennium Tower &#124; Buildings |location=Vienna / |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> In recent years, Vienna has seen numerous architecture projects completed which combine modern architectural elements with old buildings, such as the remodelling and revitalisation of the old [[Gasometer, Vienna|Gasometer]] in 2001.\nMost buildings in Vienna are relatively low; in early 2006 there were around 100 buildings higher than {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

Small parks, known by the Viennese as ''Beserlparks'', are everywhere in the inner city areas.\n\nMany of Vienna's famous parks include monuments, such as the [[Stadtpark, Vienna|Stadtpark]] with its statue of [[Johann Strauss II]], and the gardens of the [[baroque]] [[Belvedere (palace)|palace]], where the [[Austrian State Treaty|State Treaty]] was signed. Vienna's principal park is the [[Prater]] which is home to the [[Wiener Riesenrad|Riesenrad]], a [[Ferris wheel]], and [[Kugelmugel]], a micronation the shape of a sphere. The imperial [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]]'s grounds contain an 18th-century park which includes [[Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn|the world's oldest zoo]], founded in 1752.\nThe [[Donauinsel]], part of Vienna's flood defences, is a {{convert|21.1|km|1|abbr=on}} long [[artificial island]] between the Danube and Neue Donau dedicated to leisure activities.\n\n=== Sport ===\n[[File:Ernst Happel Stadion.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst-Happel-Stadion]] in the Prater]]\nAustria's capital is home to numerous [[Association football|football]] teams. The best known are the local football clubs include [[FK Austria Wien]] (21 [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] titles and record 27-time cup winners), [[SK Rapid Wien]] (record 32 [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] titles), and the oldest team, [[First Vienna FC]]. Other important [[sports club]]s include the [[Vikings Vienna|Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna]] ([[American football|American Football]]), who won the [[Eurobowl]] title between 2004 and 2007 4 times in a row and had a perfect season in 2013, the [[Aon hotVolleys Vienna]], one of Europe's premier Volleyball organisations, the Vienna Wanderers (baseball) who won the 2012 and 2013 Championship of the Austrian Baseball League, and the [[Vienna Capitals]] ([[Ice hockey|Ice Hockey]]). Vienna was also where the European Handball Federation (EHF) was founded. There are also three [[Rugby union|rugby]] clubs; [[Vienna Celtic RFC|Vienna Celtic]], the oldest rugby club in Austria, [[RC Donau]], and Stade Viennois\n\nVienna hosts many different sporting events including the [[Vienna Marathon|Vienna City Marathon]], which attracts more than 10,000 participants every year and normally takes place in May. In 2005 the [[Ice hockey|Ice Hockey]] World Championships took place in [[Austria]] and the final was played in Vienna. Vienna's [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion|Ernst Happel Stadium]] was the venue of four [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and European Champion Clubs' Cup finals (1964, 1987, 1990 and 1995) and on 29 June it hosted the final of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] which saw a Spanish 1\u20130 victory over Germany. [[Tennis]] tournament [[Vienna Open]] also takes place in the city since 1974. The matches are played in the [[Wiener Stadthalle]].\n\nThe Neue Donau, which was formed after the Donauinsel was created, is free of river traffic and has been referred to as an \"autobahn for swimmers\" due to its use by the public for commuting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pocketmags.com/outdoorswimmer-magazine/june-2017/articles/142781/vienna-s-autobahn-for-swimmers|title=VIENNA'S AUTOBAHN FOR SWIMMERS|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Culinary specialities ==\n=== Food ===\n{{See also|Austrian cuisine}}\n[[File:Sachertorte DSC03027.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Sachertorte]]'']]\nVienna is well known for ''[[Wiener Schnitzel]]'', a cutlet of [[veal]] ''(Kalbsschnitzel)'' or pork ''(Schweinsschnitzel)'' that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and fried in [[clarified butter]]. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves [[Viennese cuisine]] and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include ''[[Tafelspitz]]'' (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with ''Ger\u00f6stete Erd\u00e4pfel'' (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, ''Apfelkren'' (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and ''Schnittlauchsauce'' (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Wiener Schnitzel]]'']]\n\nVienna has a long tradition of producing cakes and desserts. These include ''[[Apple strudel|Apfelstrudel]]'' (hot apple strudel), ''[[Milchrahmstrudel]]'' (milk-cream strudel), ''[[Palatschinken]]'' (sweet pancakes), and ''Kn\u00f6del'' (dumplings) often filled with fruit such as apricots (''[[Marillenkn\u00f6del]]''). [[Sachertorte]], a delicately moist chocolate cake with apricot jam created by the [[Hotel Sacher|Sacher Hotel]], is world-famous.\n\nIn winter, small street stands sell traditional ''[[Chestnut|Maroni]]'' (hot chestnuts) and potato fritters.\n\nSausages are popular and available from street vendors (''[[W\u00fcrstelstand]]'') throughout the day and into the night. The sausage known as ''[[Frankfurter W\u00fcrstchen|Wiener]]'' (German for Viennese) in the U.S. and in Germany, is called a ''Frankfurter'' in Vienna. Other popular sausages are ''Burenwurst'' (a coarse beef and pork sausage, generally boiled), ''[[Kranjska klobasa|K\u00e4sekrainer]]'' (spicy pork with small chunks of cheese), and ''[[Bratwurst]]'' (a white pork sausage). Most can be ordered \"mit Brot\" (with bread) or as a \"hot dog\" (stuffed inside a long roll). Mustard is the traditional condiment and usually offered in two varieties: \"s\u00fc\u00df\" (sweet) or \"scharf\" (spicy).\n\nKebab, pizza and noodles are, increasingly, the snack foods most widely available from small stands.\n\nThe ''[[Naschmarkt]]'' is a permanent market for fruit, vegetables, spices, fish, meat, etc., from around the world. The city has many coffee and breakfast stores.\n\n=== Drinks ===\n[[File:Wien Heurigen-Lokal 2014 1.jpg|thumb|A typical Heurigen-Restaurant in Grinzing]]\nVienna, along with [[Paris]], [[Santiago]], [[Cape Town]], [[Prague]], [[Canberra]], [[Bratislava]] and [[Warsaw]], is one of the few remaining world capital cities with its own vineyards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austria.info/uk/things-to-do/food-and-drink/wine/vienna-the-wine-capital|title=Vienna: The Wine Capital|website=www.austria.info|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref> The wine is served in small Viennese pubs known as [[Heuriger]], which are especially numerous in the wine growing areas of [[D\u00f6bling]] ([[Grinzing]], [[Neustift am Walde]], [[Nu\u00dfdorf, Vienna|Nu\u00dfdorf]], [[Salmannsdorf]], [[Sievering]]), [[Floridsdorf]] (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), [[Liesing]] ([[Mauer, Vienna|Mauer]]) and Favoriten (Oberlaa). The wine is often drunk as a Spritzer (\"G'spritzter\") with sparkling water. The [[Gr\u00fcner Veltliner]], a dry white wine, is the most widely cultivated wine in Austria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |title=Gruner Veltliner Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}</ref>\n\nBeer is next in importance to wine. Vienna has a single large brewery, [[Brauerei Ottakringer|Ottakringer]], and more than ten [[Vienna microbreweries|microbreweries]]. A \"Beisl\" is a typical small Austrian pub, of which Vienna has many.\n\nAlso, local soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages, placing it on the top spots along American counterparts such as [[Coca-Cola]] in terms of market share. Another popular drink is the so-called \"[[Spezi]]\", a mix between [[Coca-Cola]] and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]].\n\n=== Viennese caf\u00e9s ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Kara Mustafa]] -->\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 Demel interior4, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|''Demel Caf\u00e9'']]\n[[Viennese caf\u00e9]]s have an extremely long and distinguished history that dates back centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider caf\u00e9s as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes with a glass of water. Viennese caf\u00e9s claim to have invented the process of [[drip brew|filtering coffee]] from booty captured after the second [[Battle of Vienna|Turkish siege]] in 1683. Viennese caf\u00e9s claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of [[coffee]] beans. The [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish]] King [[John III Sobieski]], the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave [[Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki|Franz George Kolschitzky]] (Polish \u2013 [[Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki|Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki]]) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]. [[Julius Meinl]] set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n{{further|Tourist attractions in Vienna}}\nMajor tourist attractions include the imperial palaces of the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]] and [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] (also home to the world's oldest zoo, [[Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn]]) and the [[Wiener Riesenrad|Riesenrad]] in the Prater.

Public transport is provided by buses, trams and five underground metro lines ([[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]), most operated by the [[Wiener Linien]]. There are also more than 50 [[Vienna S-Bahn|S-train]] stations within the city limits. Suburban trains are operated by the [[Austrian Federal Railways|\u00d6BB]]. The city forms the hub of the Austrian railway system, with services to all parts of the country and abroad. The railway system connects Vienna's main station [[Wien Hauptbahnhof|Vienna Hauptbahnhof]] with other European cities, like [[Berlin]], [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Brussels]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Munich]], [[Prague]], [[Venice]], [[Warsaw]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n\nVienna has multiple road connections including expressways and motorways.\n\nVienna is served by [[Vienna International Airport]], located {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the city centre next to the town of [[Schwechat]]. The airport handled approximately 31.7 million passengers in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=FWAG (group) facts & figures |url=https://www.viennaairport.com/en/company/investor_relations/news/traffic_results?news_beitrag_id=1578990620436 |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> Following lengthy negotiations with surrounding communities, the airport will be expanded to increase its capacity by adding a third runway. The airport is currently undergoing a major expansion, including a new terminal building that opened in 2012 to prepare for an expected increase in passengers.\n\n== International relations ==\n\n=== International organisations in Vienna ===\n[[File:Vereinte Nationen in Wien.jpg|thumb|UN complex in Vienna, with the Austria Center Vienna in front, taken from the [[Donauturm|Danube Tower]] in the nearby Donaupark before the extensive building work]][[File:Donaucity from Danube River to Northnorthwest - Vienna-.jpg|thumb|Many international organisations and offices are located in [[Donaustadt]].]]\n\nVienna is the seat of a number of United Nations offices and various international institutions and companies, including the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), the [[UNODC|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), the [[OFID|OPEC Fund for International Development]] (OFID), the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] (UNOOSA) and the [[European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] (FRA). Currently Vienna is the world's third \"UN city\", next to [[New York City|New York]], [[Geneva]], and [[Nairobi]]. Additionally, Vienna is the seat of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]]'s secretariat ([[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]]). In conjunction, the [[University of Vienna]] annually hosts the prestigious [[Willem C. Vis Moot]], an international commercial arbitration competition for students of law from around the world.\n\nVarious special diplomatic meetings have been held in Vienna in the latter half of the 20th century, resulting in various documents bearing the name [[Vienna Convention (disambiguation)|Vienna Convention]] or Vienna Document. Among the more important documents negotiated in Vienna are the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], as well as the 1990 [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]]. Vienna also hosted the negotiations leading to the 2015 [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] on Iran's nuclear program as well as the [[Vienna peace talks for Syria]].\n\nVienna also headquartered the [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] (ITF).\n\n=== Charitable organisations in Vienna ===\nAlongside international and intergovernmental organisations, there are dozens of charitable organisations based in Vienna. One such organisation is the network of [[SOS Children's Villages]], founded by [[Hermann Gmeiner]] in 1949. Today, SOS Children's Villages are active in 132 countries and territories worldwide. Others include [[Help Afghan School Children Organization|HASCO]].\n\nAnother extremely popular international event is the annual [[Life Ball]], which supports people with [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]]. Guests such as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]] were recent attendees.\n\n=== International City Cooperations ===\nThe general policy of the City of Vienna is not to sign any [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin or sister city]] agreements with other cities.

The second lap was completed in 1:03.26, a ten-metre gap had opened, with [[Tetyana Dorovskikh|Tetyana Samolenko]] edging past Melinte in chase.  2:52.66 at the bell and a fifteen-metre gap, Ivan began a last lap [[Kick (running)|kick]], trying to run the 60 second last lap to get the world record.  Because of the acceleration, the third lap was the fastest of them all at 1:02.46.  The battle was for the medals behind Ivan, [[Andrea Hahmann]] passing Samolenko, who had [[Christina Boxer|Christina Cahill]] on her shoulder with Lynn Williams in chase.  Melinte faded back to Slaney but behind all of them, [[Laimut\u0117 Baikauskait\u0117]] was charging.  Onto the home stretch the chase pack was tightening, some 30 metres behind Ivan.  Baikauskait\u0117 moved into lane 3 to find some running room.  Ivan wasn't able to find a 60-second lap, 61.5 was enough to set the [[List of Olympic records in athletics|Olympic record]] out of sight with a dominant gold medal performance.  Hahmann faded and Samolenko was leading down the stretch with Cahill in close pursuit.  Making up ten metres on the final straight, Baikauskait\u0117 passed Cahill and Hahmann in the final 15 metres and leaned past Samolenko at the line to take the silver.\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font-size:110%;\" width=\"35%\"\n|-\n|{{OlympicGoldMedalist|[[Paula Ivan]]|ROU|1988 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicSilverMedalist|[[Laimut\u0117 Baikauskait\u0117]]|URS|1988 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicBronzeMedalist|[[Tetyana Dorovskikh|Tetyana Samolenko]]|URS|1988 Summer}}\n|}\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!
