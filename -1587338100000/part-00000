After writing screenplays for ''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985), he made his directorial debut with a teen comedy, ''[[Adventures in Babysitting]]'' (1987). Columbus gained recognition soon after with the highly successful Christmas comedy-dramas, ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990) and ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'' (1992).\n\nThe comedy ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993), starring [[Robin Williams]], was another box office success for Columbus. He went on to direct ''[[Nine Months]]'' (1995), ''[[Stepmom (1998 film)|Stepmom]]'' (1998) and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999), which were met with lukewarm reception. His greatest commercial successes have been ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'' (2001) and its sequel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002). He also directed ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' (2010)'','' another critical financial success. Columbus has produced a number of films, including ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004), ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006) ''and [[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' (2011), all of which were well received. In 2015, he directed a [[3D film]], ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'' which garnered a mixed reception.\n\nColumbus is the co-founder of [[1492 Pictures]], a film production company that has produced some of his films since 1995. More recently, he co-founded another production firm with his daughter in 2014, called Maiden Voyage Pictures.

Columbus gained recognition soon after with the highly successful Christmas comedy-dramas, ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990) and ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'' (1992).\n\nThe comedy ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993), starring [[Robin Williams]], was another box office success for Columbus. He went on to direct ''[[Nine Months]]'' (1995), ''[[Stepmom (1998 film)|Stepmom]]'' (1998) and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999), which were met with lukewarm reception. His greatest commercial successes have been ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'' (2001) and its sequel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002). He also directed ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' (2010)'','' another critical financial success. Columbus has produced a number of films, including ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004), ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006) ''and [[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' (2011), all of which were well received. In 2015, he directed a [[3D film]], ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'' which garnered a mixed reception.\n\nColumbus is the co-founder of [[1492 Pictures]], a film production company that has produced some of his films since 1995. More recently, he co-founded another production firm with his daughter in 2014, called Maiden Voyage Pictures.

While there have only been a few examples of successful marketing campaigns, there have been several proposals to advertise in space, some even planning to launch giant [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] visible from the Earth. '''Obtrusive space advertising''' is the term used for such ventures.\n\nAdvertising in space has faced criticisms for contributing to the existing problem of [[space debris]] and \"polluting\" the view of space as seen from the ground. It is regulated by several international and national legislation, though as technology improves further regulation will likely be required to cover new forms of space advertising. While space advertising is limited by both contemporary regulation and technological capability, in popular culture, space advertising has taken a variety of forms and displays.\n\n== History==\nBeginning in the 1990s, when space technology became more available for companies after the [[Space Race]] and the fall of the Soviet Union,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race|title=The Space Race|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> space advertising became a point of interest for various organizations to use as a marketing tool.

While there have only been a few examples of successful marketing campaigns, there have been several proposals to advertise in space, some even planning to launch giant [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] visible from the Earth. '''Obtrusive space advertising''' is the term used for such ventures.\n\nAdvertising in space has faced criticisms for contributing to the existing problem of [[space debris]] and \"polluting\" the view of space as seen from the ground. It is regulated by several international and national legislation, though as technology improves further regulation will likely be required to cover new forms of space advertising. While space advertising is limited by both contemporary regulation and technological capability, in popular culture, space advertising has taken a variety of forms and displays.\n\n== History==\nBeginning in the 1990s, when space technology became more available for companies after the [[Space Race]] and the fall of the Soviet Union,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race|title=The Space Race|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> space advertising became a point of interest for various organizations to use as a marketing tool.
