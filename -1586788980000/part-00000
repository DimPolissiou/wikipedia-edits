Strokes are generally designated as [[flatwater]] or [[whitewater]] strokes.  The strokes are also combined or modified.<ref>American National Red Cross. ''Canoeing''. 1985. p. 135. {{ISBN|0-385-08313-0}}</ref> Some commonly known and used strokes are in the table below. Names for strokes can vary between geographical regions and even between paddlers with similar backgrounds.\n\n==List of paddle strokes==\nIn these illustrations, the bow (front) of the canoe is on the left side of the illustration and the stern (back) is on the right. The red arrow shows the paddle position at the beginning of the stroke. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[File:Draw Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Forward stroke\n| The Forward stroke is the most often used canoe stroke, so executing this stroke efficiently yields much advantage to [[Canoeists|canoeists.]] It is initiated by placing the blade at a right angle to the centerline of the canoe and drawing it straight back. \n|-\n! [[File:Back Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Reverse stroke\n| The '''reverse stroke''' is essentially the same movement as the forward stroke, but performed in reverse. The back face of the blade is used in this case. This stroke is used to make the canoe go backward or to stop the canoe. The use of this stroke is also known as \"back paddling\". (The graphic is not clear whether it shows a bow or solo paddler making this stroke.)\n|-\n! [[File:J Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />J-stroke{{anchor|jstroke}}\n| The '''J-stroke''' is so named because, when done on the [[Port and starboard|port side]], it resembles the letter ''J''. Some people, like Mike Galt, therefore preferred to call it the \"Hook stroke\" because then it is correct on both sides. It begins like a standard forward stroke, but towards the end the paddle is rotated and pushed away from the canoe with the power face of the paddle remaining the same throughout the stroke. This prying motion leads directing into the feathering - or recovery - increasing the efficiency of the J-stroke in flatwater. This conveniently counteracts the natural tendency of the canoe to steer away from the side of the solo or stern man's paddle side. It is used in reverse by the bowman to go straight while back paddling.\n|-\n! [[File:Superior Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Goon\n| The Forward stroke with pry correction is often used by white water and beginning paddlers, because it is the easiest technique to paddle a straight course. [[Bill Mason]] called it the \"Goon Stroke\". Unlike the J-stroke in which the side of the paddle pushing against the water during the stroke (the power face) is the side which is used to straighten the canoe, this stroke uses the opposite face of the paddle to make the steering motion. It is somewhat like a J stroke with a small pry at the end. It is commonly thought to be less efficient than the '''J-stroke''' when paddling long distances across relatively calm water, because it lowers your stroke frequency more than the J-stroke. \n|-\n! [[File:PitchStroke.gif|180px]] <br />Pitch stroke\n| The '''pitch stroke''' is the preferred stroke to go straight in a canoe with a good traveling speed, because this stroke tries to correct the [[Aircraft principal axis|yaw]] caused by the forward stroke almost on the same moment that it starts, where other correction strokes do this after the forward stroke, when there already is considerable [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] from the canoe. (The graphic here does not show this stroke right...)\n|-\n! [[File:Indian Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Indian stroke\n| The '''Indian stroke''' may be used to paddle a straight course like the J. It can be useful against strong winds or running rapids. Move the paddle forward, rotate the grip of the paddle in the palm of your upper hand. Then you are ready for the next power stroke without taking the blade out of the water.\n|-\n! [[File:Pry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Pry stroke\n| The '''pry stroke''' begins with the paddle inserted vertically in the water, with the power face outward, and the shaft braced against the [[gunwale]]. A gentle prying motion is applied, forcing the canoe in the opposite direction of the paddling side.\n|-\n! [[File:Pry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Push-away stroke\n| The '''push-away''' stroke has an identical purpose to the pry stroke, but is performed differently. Instead of bracing the paddle against the [[Canoe|gunwale]], the paddle is held vertically, as in the draw stroke, and pushed away from the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. This is more awkward and requires more force than the pry, but has the advantage of preventing damage to the paddle and canoe due to rubbing on the gunwale. It also uses force more efficiently, since the paddle is pushing straight out, instead of up and out.\n|-\n! [[File:RunningPry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Running pry\n| The '''running pry''', also known as a \"cut\", can be applied while the canoe is moving. As in the standard pry, the paddle is turned sideways and braced against the gunwale, but rather than forcing the paddle away from the hull, the paddler simply turns it at an angle and allows the motion of the water to provide the force.\n|-\n! [[File:DrawStroke.gif|180px]] <br />Draw stroke\n| The '''draw stroke''' exerts a force opposite to that of the pry. The paddle is inserted vertically in the water at arm's length from the gunwale, with the power face toward the canoe, and is then pulled inward to the paddler's hip. A draw can be applied while moving to create a '''running''' or '''hanging draw'''. For maximum efficiency, if multiple draw strokes are required, the paddle can be turned 90\u00b0 and sliced through the water away from the boat between strokes. This prevents the paddler from having to lift the paddle out of the water and replace it for each stroke.\n|-\n! [[File:Scull.gif|180px]] <br />Sculling draw\n| The '''sculling draw''' is an efficient and stable stroke where multiple draw strokes are required. Instead of performing repeated draw strokes, the paddle is \"sculled\" back and forth through the water. Beginning slightly in front of the paddler, the paddle is angled so that the power face points at a 45\u00b0 angle toward the hull and astern. The paddle is drawn straight backward, maintaining the angle, and then the angle is rotated so that the power face is pointing 45\u00b0 toward the hull and the bow. The paddle is pushed straight forward, and the whole process is repeated. The net effect is that the paddler in the canoe is drawn toward the paddling side.\n|-\n! [[File:Reverse Scull.gif|180px]] <br />Reverse scull\n| The '''reverse scull''' (sometimes '''sculling pry''' or '''sculling push-away''') is the opposite of the scull. The stroke is identical, but with the paddle angles reversed. The net effect is that the paddler is pushed away from the paddling side. The graphic has the arrows going the wrong way, but you get the picture.\n|-\n! [[File:Pry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Cross-draw stroke\n| The '''cross-draw stroke''' or '''cross-bow draw''' is a stroke that exerts the same vector of force as a pry, by moving the blade of the paddle to the other side of the canoe without moving the paddler's hands. The arm of bottom hand crosses in front of the bowman's body to insert the paddle in the water on the opposite side of the canoe some distance from the [[Canoe|gunwale]], facing towards the canoe, and is then pulled inward while the top hand pushes outward. The cross-draw is much stronger than the pry stroke, but normally can't be used by the stern paddler in a tandem canoe.\n|-\n! [[File:Sweep.gif|180px]] <br />Sweep\n| The '''sweep''' is unique in that it steers the canoe away from the paddle regardless of which end of the canoe it is performed in. The paddle is inserted in the water some distance from the [[Canoe|gunwale]], facing forward, and is drawn backward in a wide sweeping motion. The paddler's bottom hand is choked up to extend the reach of the paddle. In the case of the bowman, the blade will pull a quarter-circle from the bow to the paddler's waist. If in the [[stern]], the paddler pulls from the waist to the stern of the canoe. '''Backsweeps''' are the same stroke done in reverse.\n|-\n! [[File:C Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />C-stroke\n| The '''C-stroke''' is used in solo paddling. It is generally used to turn the canoe to the side opposite of the solo paddler. This is opposite to a sweep. It serves the same purpose as a J-stroke (counteracting the natural turn of the canoe away from the paddling side), but provides more correction which is necessary when starting a solo canoe from a standstill or paddling in strong wind or current.\n|}\n\n==Variations==\nThere are some differences in techniques in how the above strokes are utilized. One of these techniques involves locking or nearly locking the [[elbow]], that is on the side of the canoe the paddle is, to minimize [[Muscle|muscular]] usage of that arm to increase endurance. Another benefit of this technique is that along with using less muscle you gain longer strokes which results in an increase of the power to stroke ratio. This is generally used more with the 'stay on one side' method of paddling. The other technique is where they bend the elbow to pull the paddle out of the water before they have finished the stroke. This is generally used more with the 'switch sides often' method of paddling.\n\n===Stay on one side method===\nThe '''stay on one side''' method is where each canoeist takes opposite sides and the stern paddler uses occasional J-strokes to correct direction of travel. The side chosen is can be based on the [[wind]] and/or [[Current (fluid)|current]] direction, so the stern paddler's forward strokes are pushing the boat in the opposite direction the [[wind]] and/or [[Current (fluid)|current]] is, reducing the number of J-strokes required to keep forward [[momentum]], or sides can be chosen based on the paddlers' stronger side, since this is more comfortable and less tiring. A combination of methods for picking sides can be used, and some canoeists will switch sides after twenty to thirty minutes or longer as a means of lessening [[muscle fatigue]], when changing the direction of the boat, or in response to new [[Weather|weather conditions]]. Both paddlers must paddle on opposite sides from each other except when trying to turn the boat quickly, or in high winds or strong currents.\n\n===Switch sides often method===\nThe '''switch sides often''' method, also called ''sit and switch'', ''hit and switch'', ''hut stroke'', ''[[Minnesota]] switch'' or ''North American Touring Technique'', can be described as the paddling technique where one uses the switching of paddling sides to go straight or maneuver. The spoken command \"Hut!\" is sometimes used by the stern paddler to alert the person paddling the bow to switch sides, giving rise to the term \"Hut stroke\". This technique is intended to avoid correction strokes after the forward stroke to make a very high stroke frequency possible thus enabling paddling with high speeds for a long time. Maneuvers are generally performed by switching paddling sides (e.g., for a turn to the left, the solo/stern paddler paddles on the right side of the canoe and vice versa.) For this method, in certain situations, two tandem paddlers may paddle on the same side. This method is one of the fastest on [[Flat water surface|flat water]] and mostly used by marathon canoeists in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canoe Journal - 1998|url=https://www.jensencanoes.com/articles-news/canoe-journal/|publisher=Jensen Canoes}}</ref>\n{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}{{Dubious |reason=this is a bold claim and would need a very reliable source like a in depth study of all possible techniques along with a marked consensus on categorization of paddling methods, but the claim that this method \"is used by _ALL_ marathon canoeists...\" is problematic and likely false because there is a very good chance that there exists people who could be identified (or self-identify) as \"marathon canoeists\" (ancient or modern) who's paddling method is not precisely described by this section. This could still include those that might use a very similar method (i.e. one that includes paddling on both lateral sides) but has some unique element unto itself (e.g. to the pace and commands of a voyageur chantey, &c.)|date=June 2017}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Canoeing]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2014}}\n}}\n\n'''Canoe paddle strokes''' are the means by which a [[paddle]] (or paddles) is used to move a [[canoe]] through the [[water]].

It is used in reverse by the bowman to go straight while back paddling.\n|-\n! [[File:Superior Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Goon\n| The Forward stroke with pry correction is often used by white water and beginning paddlers, because it is the easiest technique to paddle a straight course. [[Bill Mason]] called it the \"Goon Stroke\". Unlike the J-stroke in which the side of the paddle pushing against the water during the stroke (the power face) is the side which is used to straighten the canoe, this stroke uses the opposite face of the paddle to make the steering motion. It is somewhat like a J stroke with a small pry at the end. It is commonly thought to be less efficient than the '''J-stroke''' when paddling long distances across relatively calm water, because it lowers your stroke frequency more than the J-stroke. \n|-\n! [[File:PitchStroke.gif|180px]] <br />Pitch stroke\n| The '''pitch stroke''' is the preferred stroke to go straight in a canoe with a good traveling speed, because this stroke tries to correct the [[Aircraft principal axis|yaw]] caused by the forward stroke almost on the same moment that it starts, where other correction strokes do this after the forward stroke, when there already is considerable [[yaw]] from the canoe. (The graphic here does not show this stroke right...)\n|-\n! [[File:Indian Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Indian stroke\n| The '''Indian stroke''' may be used to paddle a straight course like the J. It can be useful against strong winds or running rapids. Move the paddle forward, rotate the grip of the paddle in the palm of your upper hand. Then you are ready for the next power stroke without taking the blade out of the water.\n|-\n! [[File:Pry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Pry stroke\n| The '''pry stroke''' begins with the paddle inserted vertically in the water, with the power face outward, and the shaft braced against the [[gunwale]]. A gentle prying motion is applied, forcing the canoe in the opposite direction of the paddling side.\n|-\n! [[File:Pry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Push-away stroke\n| The '''push-away''' stroke has an identical purpose to the pry stroke, but is performed differently. Instead of bracing the paddle against the [[Canoe|gunwale]], the paddle is held vertically, as in the draw stroke, and pushed away from the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. This is more awkward and requires more force than the pry, but has the advantage of preventing damage to the paddle and canoe due to rubbing on the gunwale. It also uses force more efficiently, since the paddle is pushing straight out, instead of up and out.\n|-\n! [[File:RunningPry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Running pry\n| The '''running pry''', also known as a \"cut\", can be applied while the canoe is moving. As in the standard pry, the paddle is turned sideways and braced against the gunwale, but rather than forcing the paddle away from the hull, the paddler simply turns it at an angle and allows the motion of the water to provide the force.\n|-\n! [[File:DrawStroke.gif|180px]] <br />Draw stroke\n| The '''draw stroke''' exerts a force opposite to that of the pry. The paddle is inserted vertically in the water at arm's length from the gunwale, with the power face toward the canoe, and is then pulled inward to the paddler's hip. A draw can be applied while moving to create a '''running''' or '''hanging draw'''. For maximum efficiency, if multiple draw strokes are required, the paddle can be turned 90\u00b0 and sliced through the water away from the boat between strokes. This prevents the paddler from having to lift the paddle out of the water and replace it for each stroke.\n|-\n! [[File:Scull.gif|180px]] <br />Sculling draw\n| The '''sculling draw''' is an efficient and stable stroke where multiple draw strokes are required. Instead of performing repeated draw strokes, the paddle is \"sculled\" back and forth through the water. Beginning slightly in front of the paddler, the paddle is angled so that the power face points at a 45\u00b0 angle toward the hull and astern. The paddle is drawn straight backward, maintaining the angle, and then the angle is rotated so that the power face is pointing 45\u00b0 toward the hull and the bow. The paddle is pushed straight forward, and the whole process is repeated. The net effect is that the paddler in the canoe is drawn toward the paddling side.\n|-\n! [[File:Reverse Scull.gif|180px]] <br />Reverse scull\n| The '''reverse scull''' (sometimes '''sculling pry''' or '''sculling push-away''') is the opposite of the scull. The stroke is identical, but with the paddle angles reversed. The net effect is that the paddler is pushed away from the paddling side. The graphic has the arrows going the wrong way, but you get the picture.\n|-\n! [[File:Pry Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />Cross-draw stroke\n| The '''cross-draw stroke''' or '''cross-bow draw''' is a stroke that exerts the same vector of force as a pry, by moving the blade of the paddle to the other side of the canoe without moving the paddler's hands. The arm of bottom hand crosses in front of the bowman's body to insert the paddle in the water on the opposite side of the canoe some distance from the [[Canoe|gunwale]], facing towards the canoe, and is then pulled inward while the top hand pushes outward. The cross-draw is much stronger than the pry stroke, but normally can't be used by the stern paddler in a tandem canoe.\n|-\n! [[File:Sweep.gif|180px]] <br />Sweep\n| The '''sweep''' is unique in that it steers the canoe away from the paddle regardless of which end of the canoe it is performed in. The paddle is inserted in the water some distance from the [[Canoe|gunwale]], facing forward, and is drawn backward in a wide sweeping motion. The paddler's bottom hand is choked up to extend the reach of the paddle. In the case of the bowman, the blade will pull a quarter-circle from the bow to the paddler's waist. If in the [[stern]], the paddler pulls from the waist to the stern of the canoe. '''Backsweeps''' are the same stroke done in reverse.\n|-\n! [[File:C Stroke.gif|180px]] <br />C-stroke\n| The '''C-stroke''' is used in solo paddling. It is generally used to turn the canoe to the side opposite of the solo paddler. This is opposite to a sweep. It serves the same purpose as a J-stroke (counteracting the natural turn of the canoe away from the paddling side), but provides more correction which is necessary when starting a solo canoe from a standstill or paddling in strong wind or current.\n|}\n\n==Variations==\nThere are some differences in techniques in how the above strokes are utilized. One of these techniques involves locking or nearly locking the [[elbow]], that is on the side of the canoe the paddle is, to minimize [[Muscle|muscular]] usage of that arm to increase endurance. Another benefit of this technique is that along with using less muscle you gain longer strokes which results in an increase of the power to stroke ratio. This is generally used more with the 'stay on one side' method of paddling. The other technique is where they bend the elbow to pull the paddle out of the water before they have finished the stroke. This is generally used more with the 'switch sides often' method of paddling.\n\n===Stay on one side method===\nThe '''stay on one side''' method is where each canoeist takes opposite sides and the stern paddler uses occasional J-strokes to correct direction of travel. The side chosen is can be based on the [[wind]] and/or [[Current (fluid)|current]] direction, so the stern paddler's forward strokes are pushing the boat in the opposite direction the [[wind]] and/or [[Current (fluid)|current]] is, reducing the number of J-strokes required to keep forward [[momentum]], or sides can be chosen based on the paddlers' stronger side, since this is more comfortable and less tiring. A combination of methods for picking sides can be used, and some canoeists will switch sides after twenty to thirty minutes or longer as a means of lessening [[muscle fatigue]], when changing the direction of the boat, or in response to new [[Weather|weather conditions]]. Both paddlers must paddle on opposite sides from each other except when trying to turn the boat quickly, or in high winds or strong currents.\n\n===Switch sides often method===\nThe '''switch sides often''' method, also called ''sit and switch'', ''hit and switch'', ''hut stroke'', ''[[Minnesota]] switch'' or ''North American Touring Technique'', can be described as the paddling technique where one uses the switching of paddling sides to go straight or maneuver. The spoken command \"Hut!\" is sometimes used by the stern paddler to alert the person paddling the bow to switch sides, giving rise to the term \"Hut stroke\". This technique is intended to avoid correction strokes after the forward stroke to make a very high stroke frequency possible thus enabling paddling with high speeds for a long time. Maneuvers are generally performed by switching paddling sides (e.g., for a turn to the left, the solo/stern paddler paddles on the right side of the canoe and vice versa.) For this method, in certain situations, two tandem paddlers may paddle on the same side. This method is one of the fastest on [[Flat water surface|flat water]] and mostly used by marathon canoeists in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canoe Journal - 1998|url=https://www.jensencanoes.com/articles-news/canoe-journal/|publisher=Jensen Canoes}}</ref>\n{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}{{Dubious |reason=this is a bold claim and would need a very reliable source like a in depth study of all possible techniques along with a marked consensus on categorization of paddling methods, but the claim that this method \"is used by _ALL_ marathon canoeists...\" is problematic and likely false because there is a very good chance that there exists people who could be identified (or self-identify) as \"marathon canoeists\" (ancient or modern) who's paddling method is not precisely described by this section.

Bharata states that certain combination of notes are pleasant, certain not so. His methods of experimenting with the instrument triggered further work by ancient Indian scholars, leading to the development of successive permutations, as well as theories of musical note inter-relationships, interlocking scales and how this makes the listener feel.{{Sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=73\u201374}} Bharata discusses ''Bhairava'', ''Kaushika'', ''Hindola'', ''Dipaka'', ''SrI-r\u0101ga'', and ''Megha''.

According to them, a ''r\u0101ga'' of the ancient Indian tradition is best described as \"a non-constructible set in music\", just like non-constructible set in language for human communication, in a manner described by [[Frederik Kortlandt]] and [[George van Driem]].{{Sfn|Fabian| Renee Timmers| Emery Schubert|2014|pp=173\u201374}}\n\n[[File:Sitar Sarod Jugalbandi - lakshay & Aayush Mohan Gupta.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Two Indian musicians performing a ''r\u0101ga'' duet called ''[[Jugalbandi]]''.]]\nThe attempt to appreciate, understand and explain ''r\u0101ga'' among European scholars started in the early colonial period.{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} In 1784, Jones translated it as \"mode\" of European music tradition, but Willard corrected him in 1834 with the statement that a ''r\u0101ga'' is both mode and tune. In 1933, states Jos\u00e9 Luiz Martinez \u2013 a professor of Music, Stern refined this explanation to \"the ''r\u0101ga'' is more fixed than mode, less fixed than the melody, beyond the mode and short of melody, and richer both than a given mode or a given melody; it is mode with added multiple specialities\".{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression, yet the concept has no direct Western translation. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of ''r\u0101ga'' cannot be offered in one or two sentences.{{Sfn|Kaufmann|1968|p=v}} ''r\u0101ga'' is a fusion of technical and ideational ideas found in music, and may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}} In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The ''r\u0101ga'' allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} A musician playing a ''r\u0101ga'', states [[Bruno Nettl]], may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each ''r\u0101ga'', in order for the performance to create a ''rasa'' (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each ''r\u0101ga''. A ''r\u0101ga'' can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of ''r\u0101ga'' are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ''r\u0101gas''.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|p=5}} ''R\u0101ga'' in Indian classic music is intimately related to ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' or guidance about \"division of time\", with each unit called a ''matra'' (beat, and duration between beats).{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is not a tune, because the same ''r\u0101ga'' can yield an infinite number of tunes.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} A ''r\u0101ga'' is not a scale, because many ''r\u0101gas'' can be based on the same scale.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}}{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} A ''r\u0101ga'', according to Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to a mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} The goal of a ''r\u0101ga'' and its artist is to create ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as [[classical Indian dance]] does with performance arts.

The North Indian system suggests a particular time of a day or a season, in the belief that the human state of psyche and mind are affected by the seasons and by daily biological cycles and nature's rhythms. The South Indian system is closer to the text, and places less emphasis on time or season.{{Sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=17\u201323}}{{Sfn|Randel|2003|pp=813\u201321}}\n\nThe symbolic role of classical music through ''r\u0101ga'' has been both aesthetic indulgence and the spiritual purifying of one's mind (yoga).

He associated pure and simple ''r\u0101gas'' to early morning, mixed and more complex ''r\u0101gas'' to late morning, skillful ''r\u0101gas'' to noon, love-themed and passionate ''r\u0101gas'' to evening, and universal ''r\u0101gas'' to night.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=36\u201338}}\n\n===R\u0101ga and mathematics===\nAccording to Cris Forster, mathematical studies on systematizing and analyzing South Indian ''r\u0101ga'' began in the 16th century.{{Sfn|Forster|2010|pp= 564\u2013565; [http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org/Ramamatya-s_Vina.htm Quote]: \"In the next five sections, we will examine the evolution of South Indian ragas in the writings of Ramamatya (fl. c. 1550), Venkatamakhi (fl. c. 1620), and Govinda (c. 1800).

Ramamatya was the first Indian theorist to formulate a system based on a mathematically determined tuning.

The ''anga'' itself has six cycles (''cakra''), where the ''purvanga'' or lower tetrachord is anchored, while there are six permutations of ''uttaranga'' suggested to the artist.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|p=815}} After this system was developed, the Indian classical music scholars have developed additional ''r\u0101gas'' for all the scales. The North Indian style is closer to the Western diatonic modes, and built upon the foundation developed by Bhatkhande using ten ''Thaat'': ''kalyan, bilaval, khamaj, kafi, asavari, bhairavi, bhairav, purvi, marva and todi''.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|pp=815\u2013816}} Some ''r\u0101gas'' are common to both systems and have same names, such as ''kalyan'' performed by either is recognizably the same.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|p=816}} Some ''r\u0101gas'' are common to both systems but have different names, such as ''malkos'' of Hindustani system is recognizably the same as ''hindolam'' of Carnatic system. However, some ''r\u0101gas'' are named the same in the two systems, but they are different, such as ''todi''.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|p=816}}\n\nR\u0101gas that have four swaras are called ''surtara'' (\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0924\u0930) r\u0101gas; those with five swaras are called ''audava'' (\u0914\u0921\u0935) r\u0101gas; those with six, ''shaadava'' (\u0937\u093e\u0921\u0935); and with seven, ''[[sampurna raga|sampurna]]'' (\u0938\u0902\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923, [[Sanskrit]] for 'complete'). The number of swaras may differ in the ascending and descending like r\u0101ga Bhimpalasi which has five notes in the ascending and seven notes in descending or Khamaj with six notes in the ascending and seven in the descending. R\u0101gas differ in their ascending or descending movements. Those that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of swaras are called ''vakra'' (\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0930) ('crooked') r\u0101gas.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Carnatic r\u0101ga==\n{{main|Carnatic r\u0101ga}}\nIn [[Carnatic music]], the principal r\u0101gas are called ''[[Melakartha]]s'', which literally means \"lord of the scale\". It is also called ''Asraya r\u0101ga'' meaning \"shelter giving r\u0101ga\", or ''Janaka r\u0101ga'' meaning \"father r\u0101ga\".{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nA ''Thaata'' in the South Indian tradition are groups of derivative ''r\u0101gas'', which are called ''[[Janya]] r\u0101gas'' meaning \"begotten r\u0101gas\" or ''Asrita r\u0101gas'' meaning \"sheltered r\u0101gas\".{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} However, these terms are approximate and interim phrases during learning, as the relationships between the two layers are neither fixed nor has unique parent-child relationship.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nJanaka r\u0101gas are grouped together using a scheme called ''[[Katapayadi]] sutra'' and are organised as ''Melakarta'' r\u0101gas. A Melakarta r\u0101ga is one which has all seven notes in both the \u0101r\u014dhanam (ascending scale) and avar\u014dhanam (descending scale). Some ''[[Melakarta]]'' r\u0101gas are ''[[Harikambhoji]]'', ''[[Kalyani (r\u0101ga)|Kalyani]]'', ''[[Kharaharapriya]]'', ''[[Mayamalavagowla]]'', ''[[Dheerasankarabharanam|Sankarabharanam]]'' and ''[[Hanumatodi|Todi]]''.<ref name=\"raganidhi\">''Raganidhi'' by P.

Some are known as ''[[gharana]]'' (houses), and their performances are staged through ''sabhas'' (music organizations).{{Sfn|Tenzer|2006|pp=303\u2013309}}<ref>Sanyukta Kashalkar-Karve (2013), \"Comparative Study of Ancient Gurukul System and the New Trends of Guru-Shishya Parampara,\" American International Journal of Research in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Volume 2, Number 1, pages 81\u201384</ref> Each ''gharana'' has freely improvised over time, and differences in the rendering of each ''r\u0101ga'' is discernible. In the Indian musical schooling tradition, the small group of students lived near or with the teacher, the teacher treated them as family members providing food and boarding, and a student learnt various aspects of music thereby continuing the musical knowledge of his [[guru]].{{Sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=457\u2013467}} The tradition survives in parts of India, and many musicians can trace their guru lineage.{{Sfn|Ries|1969|p=22}}\n\n==Persian R\u0101k==\nThe music concept of ''R\u0101k'' in Persian is probably a pronunciation of ''r\u0101ga''.

Bharata states that certain combination of notes are pleasant, certain not so. His methods of experimenting with the instrument triggered further work by ancient Indian scholars, leading to the development of successive permutations, as well as theories of musical note inter-relationships, interlocking scales and how this makes the listener feel.{{Sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=73\u201374}} Bharata discusses ''Bhairava'', ''Kaushika'', ''Hindola'', ''Dipaka'', ''SrI-r\u0101ga'', and ''Megha''.

According to them, a ''r\u0101ga'' of the ancient Indian tradition is best described as \"a non-constructible set in music\", just like non-constructible set in language for human communication, in a manner described by [[Frederik Kortlandt]] and [[George van Driem]].{{Sfn|Fabian| Renee Timmers| Emery Schubert|2014|pp=173\u201374}}\n\n[[File:Sitar Sarod Jugalbandi - lakshay & Aayush Mohan Gupta.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Two Indian musicians performing a ''r\u0101ga'' duet called ''[[Jugalbandi]]''.]]\nThe attempt to appreciate, understand and explain ''r\u0101ga'' among European scholars started in the early colonial period.{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} In 1784, Jones translated it as \"mode\" of European music tradition, but Willard corrected him in 1834 with the statement that a ''r\u0101ga'' is both mode and tune. In 1933, states Jos\u00e9 Luiz Martinez \u2013 a professor of Music, Stern refined this explanation to \"the ''r\u0101ga'' is more fixed than mode, less fixed than the melody, beyond the mode and short of melody, and richer both than a given mode or a given melody; it is mode with added multiple specialities\".{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression, yet the concept has no direct Western translation. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of ''r\u0101ga'' cannot be offered in one or two sentences.{{Sfn|Kaufmann|1968|p=v}} ''r\u0101ga'' is a fusion of technical and ideational ideas found in music, and may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}} In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The ''r\u0101ga'' allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} A musician playing a ''r\u0101ga'', states [[Bruno Nettl]], may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each ''r\u0101ga'', in order for the performance to create a ''rasa'' (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each ''r\u0101ga''. A ''r\u0101ga'' can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of ''r\u0101ga'' are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ''r\u0101gas''.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|p=5}} ''R\u0101ga'' in Indian classic music is intimately related to ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' or guidance about \"division of time\", with each unit called a ''matra'' (beat, and duration between beats).{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is not a tune, because the same ''r\u0101ga'' can yield an infinite number of tunes.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} A ''r\u0101ga'' is not a scale, because many ''r\u0101gas'' can be based on the same scale.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}}{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} A ''r\u0101ga'', according to Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to a mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} The goal of a ''r\u0101ga'' and its artist is to create ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as [[classical Indian dance]] does with performance arts.

The ''anga'' itself has six cycles (''cakra''), where the ''purvanga'' or lower tetrachord is anchored, while there are six permutations of ''uttaranga'' suggested to the artist.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|p=815}} After this system was developed, the Indian classical music scholars have developed additional ''r\u0101gas'' for all the scales. The North Indian style is closer to the Western diatonic modes, and built upon the foundation developed by Bhatkhande using ten ''Thaat'': ''kalyan, bilaval, khamaj, kafi, asavari, bhairavi, bhairav, purvi, marva and todi''.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|pp=815\u2013816}} Some ''r\u0101gas'' are common to both systems and have same names, such as ''kalyan'' performed by either is recognizably the same.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|p=816}} Some ''r\u0101gas'' are common to both systems but have different names, such as ''malkos'' of Hindustani system is recognizably the same as ''hindolam'' of Carnatic system. However, some ''r\u0101gas'' are named the same in the two systems, but they are different, such as ''todi''.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|p=816}}\n\nR\u0101gas that have four swaras are called ''surtara'' (\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0924\u0930) r\u0101gas; those with five swaras are called ''audava'' (\u0914\u0921\u0935) r\u0101gas; those with six, ''shaadava'' (\u0937\u093e\u0921\u0935); and with seven, ''[[sampurna raga|sampurna]]'' (\u0938\u0902\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923, [[Sanskrit]] for 'complete'). The number of swaras may differ in the ascending and descending like r\u0101ga Bhimpalasi which has five notes in the ascending and seven notes in descending or Khamaj with six notes in the ascending and seven in the descending. R\u0101gas differ in their ascending or descending movements. Those that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of swaras are called ''vakra'' (\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0930) ('crooked') r\u0101gas.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Carnatic r\u0101ga==\n{{main|Carnatic r\u0101ga}}\nIn [[Carnatic music]], the principal r\u0101gas are called ''[[Melakartha]]s'', which literally means \"lord of the scale\".

It stars [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], and [[Catherine O'Hara]]. The film follows an eight-year-old boy (Culkin), who must defend his home from two burglars (Pesci and Stern) after his family mistakenly leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation. It was filmed between February and May 1990, in an array of locations. The film was originally meant to be a production from [[Warner Bros.]], but was changed to a [[20th Century Fox]] production when Hughes exceeded a $10 million budget that he promised for the film with Warner Bros. \n\n''Home Alone'' premiered on November 10, 1990, in Chicago, and was released wider in the United States on November 16, 1990. With a total gross of $476.7 million, it was the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever, and held the record until it was overtaken by ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' in 2011. The film received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Culkin, as well as two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], which was composed by [[John Williams]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Somewhere in My Memory\". Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics on its initial release, ''Home Alone'' has been hailed as a holiday classic among audiences and is often regarded as one of the best Christmas films ever made.\n\n''Home Alone'' spawned a successful [[Home Alone (franchise)|film franchise]] that started with the 1992 sequel ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'', which is the only ''Home Alone'' sequel to have most of the original cast reprising their roles.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Do not add unnecessary detail to this section. -->\nThe McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home in a [[Chicago]] [[Chicago land|suburb]] on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings. Later, Kevin accidentally ruins the family dinner and their flight tickets to Paris after a scuffle with his older brother Buzz, resulting in him getting sent to the [[attic]] of the house as a punishment, where he berates Kate and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds damage the power lines, which causes a [[power outage]] and resets the alarm clocks, causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.\n\nKevin wakes to find the house empty and, thinking that his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. However, he soon becomes frightened by his next door neighbor, Old Man Marley, who is rumored to be a [[serial killer]] who murdered his own family, as well as the \"Wet Bandits\", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to put their plans on hold.\n\nKate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked. Peter and the rest of the family stay in his brother's apartment in Paris, while Kate manages to get a flight back to the United States, but only gets as far as [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago, but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to [[Chicago]] on their way to [[Milwaukee]] in a moving van, which she gratefully accepts.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Marv finally realize that Kevin is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into his house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local [[Santa Claus]] impersonator if he could bring his family back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a [[choir]] perform, then meets Old Man Marley, who dispels the rumors about him. He points out his granddaughter in the choir, whom he never gets to meet, as he and his son are estranged; Kevin suggests that he should reconcile with his son.\n\nKevin returns home and rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s to take on the burglars. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin around the house, he calls the police and flees, then lures Harry and Marv into a neighboring home which they previously broke into. They ambush him and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marv's destructive characteristic of flooding them.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Kevin is disappointed to find that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house and call for him; they reconcile and are soon joined by Peter, Buzz, Jeff, Megan, and Linnie, who waited in Paris until they could obtain a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then observes Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. Marley notices Kevin, and the pair wave to each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Kevin, a rambunctious eight-year-old with a penchant for creating harmful inventions\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Harry, a short and hotheaded thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Marv\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Marv, a tall and dim-witted thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Harry\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Peter, Kevin's father\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Marley, Kevin's elderly neighbor\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kate, Kevin's mother and Peter's wife\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Linnie, Kevin's older sister\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Buzz, Kevin's oldest brother who often gets him into trouble\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Uncle Frank, Peter's older brother\n* [[Hillary Wolf]] as Megan, Kevin's oldest sister\n* [[John Candy]] as Gus Polinski, polka performer who helps Kate\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Officer Balzak\n* [[Michael C.

Hughes explained that \"I was going away on vacation, and making a list of everything I didn\u2019t want to forget. I thought, 'well, I'd better not forget my kids.' Then I thought, 'what if I left my 10-year-old son at home?

Hughes had promised the studio he could make the movie for no more than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, even minimally, and that Warner would insist on keeping to it, Hughes met secretly with [[20th Century Fox]] before production to see if they would be interested in funding the project if Warner proved as inflexible as the producer feared. A copy of the script was \"clandestinely\" delivered to Fox, according to [[executive producer]] Scott Rosenfelt, bypassing the legal restrictions that would have otherwise prevented Fox from seeing it until the project was in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].<ref name=\"The Movies that Made Us\">{{cite news|last=Bucklow|first=Andrew|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212233609/https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/home-alone-secrets-revealed-in-netflix-show-the-movies-that-made-us/news-story/7dd4896680c9c157e18b7f4e264c418f|title=''Home Alone'' secrets revealed in Netflix show 'The Movies That Made Us'|date=December 4, 2019|newspaper=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=December 4, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/home-alone-secrets-revealed-in-netflix-show-the-movies-that-made-us/news-story/7dd4896680c9c157e18b7f4e264c418f|archive-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEarly in production, the film's budget grew to $14.7 million, well past the limit Warner had imposed.

The film was originally meant to be a production from [[Warner Bros.]], but was changed to a [[20th Century Fox]] production when Hughes exceeded a $10 million budget that he promised for the film with Warner Bros. \n\n''Home Alone'' premiered on November 10, 1990, in Chicago, and was released wider in the United States on November 16, 1990. With a total gross of $476.7 million, it was the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever, and held the record until it was overtaken by ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' in 2011. The film received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Culkin, as well as two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], which was composed by [[John Williams]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Somewhere in My Memory\". Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics on its initial release, ''Home Alone'' has been hailed as a holiday classic among audiences and is often regarded as one of the best Christmas films ever made.\n\n''Home Alone'' spawned a successful [[Home Alone (franchise)|film franchise]] that started with the 1992 sequel ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'', which is the only ''Home Alone'' sequel to have most of the original cast reprising their roles.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Do not add unnecessary detail to this section. -->\nThe McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home in a [[Chicago]] [[Chicago land|suburb]] on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings. Later, Kevin accidentally ruins the family dinner and their flight tickets to Paris after a scuffle with his older brother Buzz, resulting in him getting sent to the [[attic]] of the house as a punishment, where he berates Kate and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds damage the power lines, which causes a [[power outage]] and resets the alarm clocks, causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.\n\nKevin wakes to find the house empty and, thinking that his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. However, he soon becomes frightened by his next door neighbor, Old Man Marley, who is rumored to be a [[serial killer]] who murdered his own family, as well as the \"Wet Bandits\", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to put their plans on hold.\n\nKate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked. Peter and the rest of the family stay in his brother's apartment in Paris, while Kate manages to get a flight back to the United States, but only gets as far as [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago, but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to [[Chicago]] on their way to [[Milwaukee]] in a moving van, which she gratefully accepts.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Marv finally realize that Kevin is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into his house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local [[Santa Claus]] impersonator if he could bring his family back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a [[choir]] perform, then meets Old Man Marley, who dispels the rumors about him. He points out his granddaughter in the choir, whom he never gets to meet, as he and his son are estranged; Kevin suggests that he should reconcile with his son.\n\nKevin returns home and rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s to take on the burglars. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin around the house, he calls the police and flees, then lures Harry and Marv into a neighboring home which they previously broke into. They ambush him and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marv's destructive characteristic of flooding them.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Kevin is disappointed to find that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house and call for him; they reconcile and are soon joined by Peter, Buzz, Jeff, Megan, and Linnie, who waited in Paris until they could obtain a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then observes Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. Marley notices Kevin, and the pair wave to each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Kevin, a rambunctious eight-year-old with a penchant for creating harmful inventions\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Harry, a short and hotheaded thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Marv\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Marv, a tall and dim-witted thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Harry\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Peter, Kevin's father\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Marley, Kevin's elderly neighbor\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kate, Kevin's mother and Peter's wife\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Linnie, Kevin's older sister\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Buzz, Kevin's oldest brother who often gets him into trouble\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Uncle Frank, Peter's older brother\n* [[Hillary Wolf]] as Megan, Kevin's oldest sister\n* [[John Candy]] as Gus Polinski, polka performer who helps Kate\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Officer Balzak\n* [[Michael C.

Hughes explained that \"I was going away on vacation, and making a list of everything I didn\u2019t want to forget. I thought, 'well, I'd better not forget my kids.'

Hughes had promised the studio he could make the movie for no more than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, even minimally, and that Warner would insist on keeping to it, Hughes met secretly with [[20th Century Fox]] before production to see if they would be interested in funding the project if Warner proved as inflexible as the producer feared. A copy of the script was \"clandestinely\" delivered to Fox, according to [[executive producer]] Scott Rosenfelt, bypassing the legal restrictions that would have otherwise prevented Fox from seeing it until the project was in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].<ref name=\"The Movies that Made Us\">{{cite news|last=Bucklow|first=Andrew|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212233609/https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/home-alone-secrets-revealed-in-netflix-show-the-movies-that-made-us/news-story/7dd4896680c9c157e18b7f4e264c418f|title=''Home Alone'' secrets revealed in Netflix show 'The Movies That Made Us'|date=December 4, 2019|newspaper=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=December 4, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/home-alone-secrets-revealed-in-netflix-show-the-movies-that-made-us/news-story/7dd4896680c9c157e18b7f4e264c418f|archive-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\nEarly in production, the film's budget grew to $14.7 million, well past the limit Warner had imposed. The studio demanded that it be cut by $1.2 million; the producers responded with a memo arguing that the budget could not be cut any further. Warner, unconvinced, shut down production the next day.

It was last assigned to the [[42d Bombardment Wing]] at [[Loring Air Force Base]], Maine, where it was inactivated on 30 April 1994.\n\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]'s earliest predecessor was the '''542d Bombardment Squadron''', which served as a [[heavy bomber]] training unit during [[World War II]] and was inactivated in a general reorganization of [[Army Air Forces]] training units in 1944.\n\nThe '''42d Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated in 1955 at Loring.  Although initially equipped with [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]]s, it soon reequipped with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.  It provided worldwide refueling until inactivated in 1994 as Loring was closed. \n\n==History==\n===Heavy bomber training===\n[[File:Alamogordo Army Airfield - B-24 Liberator 42-52161 over New Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|B-24 Liberator of a training unit in the southwest]]\nThe first predecessor of the squadron was the '''542d Bombardment Squadron''', which was activated at [[Salt Lake City Army Air Base]], Utah as one of the four original squadrons of the [[383d Bombardment Group]].  Its [[cadre (military)|cadre]] moved to [[Rapid City Army Air Base]] a little over a week later, where it began to equip as a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[Operational - Replacement Training Units#Operational Training Units|Operational Training Unit]] (OTU) the following year.<ref name=Maurer542BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 647</ref><ref name=Maurer383BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 270</ref> OTUs were oversized parent units that provided cadres to \"satellite groups\"<ref name=CCxxxvi> Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi</ref>\n\nIn October 1943, the squadron moved to [[Peterson Field]], Colorado, where it flew [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] and changed its mission to become a [[Operational - Replacement Training Units#Replacement Training Units|Replacement Training Unit]] (RTU).  Like OTUs, RTUs were oversized units, but their mission was to train individual [[aircrew]]s.<ref name=CCxxxvi/> However, the AAF was finding that standard military units like the 542d, which were based on relatively inflexible [[tables of organization]] were not well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit, which was manned and equipped for the specific training mission.<ref>Goss, p. 75</ref> As a result, the 383d Group, its elements and supporting units were inactivated or disbanded<ref name=Maurer542BS/><ref name=Maurer383BG/> and replaced by the 214th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School, Heavy), which was simultaneously organized at Peterson.\n\n===Air refueling operations===\n====KC-97 era====\nThe '''42d Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated at [[Limestone Air Force Base]] on 18 January 1955 and assigned to the [[42d Bombardment Wing]].  Although designated as a heavy squadron, it was equipped with [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]]s.  The squadron received its first KC-97 in February and was fully equipped by the end of the following month.  When it was activated, its parent [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] was equipped with the [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker]], which did not have an [[air refueling]] capability, so it focused on providing refueling support for other [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) units.  SAC had begun to include refueling in its war plans,<ref>Smith, p. 31</ref> and the squadron frequently deployed its tankers to forward locations, or deployed as a squadron , placing it ahead of the faster [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]]s it would refuel, and on their programmed route.<ref>''See'' Smith, p. 39</ref> It deployed to [[Thule Air Base]], Greenland; [[Sidi Slimane Air Base]], French Morocco; and [[Ernest Harmon Air Force Base|Ernest Harmon]] and [[Goose Air Base]]s, Labrador.<ref name=AFOOB/>\n\n====Conversion to KC-135s====\nIn August 1957, the squadron became nonoperational, as it began transferring its KC-97s to other units.  The arrival of replacement [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s, originally scheduled for August was delayed.  The first of the new planes did not arrive until October, and the squadron did not reach full strength until April 1958 and did not become combat ready until May.<ref name=AFOOB/> The [[bomber]] squadrons of the 42d Wing had begun to equip with [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft, and the KC-135 could deliver twice the amount of fuel to the B-52 without the fuel consumption caused by the descent and climb required to refuel with the KC-97.<ref>Smith, p. 45</ref> In June 1958, squadron planes began standing [[alert status|alert]].<ref name=AFOOB/> The percentage of SAC planes on alert gradually grew over the next two years.<ref>Narducci, p. 3</ref> Starting in 1960, one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen minute alert, fully fueled to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.  This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml |title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\nSoon after detection of Soviet missiles in Cuba, On 22 October 1962, 1/8 of SAC's B-52s were placed on airborne alert.  SAC placed additional KC-135s on alert to replace KC-135s devoted to maintaining the B-52 bomber force on airborne alert.  On 24 October SAC went to [[DEFCON]] 2, placing all aircraft on alert.<ref>Kipp, ''et al''., pp. 34\u201335</ref> Forward tankers at Loring were organized as a tanker task force.   Tanker crews from the 42d flew 214 air refueling missions during the crisis.<ref name=AFOOB/> As tensions eased, on 21 November, SAC returned to normal airborne alert posture and went to DEFCON 3. Dispersed tankers were recalled on 24 November. On 27 November SAC returned to normal alert posture.<ref>Kipp, ''et al''., pp. 47, 61</ref>\n\n====Refueling support in Southeast Asia and elsewhere====\nIn 1965, the squadron began to deploy aircraft and aircrew support for [[Operation Young Tiger]] operations in Southeast Asia.  This support for other units refueling combat operations in Southeast Asia continued until 1975.<ref name=AFOOB/><ref name=Ravenstein42BW>Ravenstein, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 5 September 1983, members of the 42d escorted a flight of [[McDonnell F-4E Phantom II]]s deploying across the Atlantic to a base in Germany.  One of the Phantoms experienced failure of one engine, and its second engine began to overheat.  It was diverted to [[Gander Airport]], Newfoundland, but could not maintain level flight.  Crew E-113 managed to connect its boom to the Phantom's refueling receptacle and literally tow the fighter back up to 10,000 feet above sea level.  The refueling was further complicated by the partial loss of hydraulics by the fighter, which caused it to fly while [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]]ing.  The tanker refueled the fighter four times at speeds one hundred knots slower than normal refueling speed, with both planes near their stalling speed.<ref name=Bayly>{{cite news|last1=Bayly|first1=Julia|title=Fort Kent brothers recall years spent keeping planes flying at Loring|url= http://bangordailynews.com/2013/07/21/news/aroostook/fort-kent-brothers-recall-years-spent-keeping-planes-flying-at-loring/ |accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=21 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=White>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=J.

The squadron provided this support while converting from the KC-135A to the KC-135R. The first \"R\" model KC-135 arrived in May 1989, but the full conversion took around 12 months.<ref name=AFOOB/>\n\nDuring [[Desert Shield]] and Desert Storm, the squadron deployed aircrew and tankers to [[Lajes Air Base]], Azores, where it provided all aircrew and aircraft for the first three weeks of the operation. It also deployed personnel to France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Diego Garcia.<ref name=AFOOB/>\n\nIn September 1991, SAC implemented the Air Force's Objective Wing organization and the squadron was assigned to the newly-formed 42d Operations Group.  This assignment would last less than two years.

It was last assigned to the [[42d Bombardment Wing]] at [[Loring Air Force Base]], Maine, where it was inactivated on 30 April 1994.\n\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]'s earliest predecessor was the '''542d Bombardment Squadron''', which served as a [[heavy bomber]] training unit during [[World War II]] and was inactivated in a general reorganization of [[Army Air Forces]] training units in 1944.\n\nThe '''42d Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated in 1955 at Loring.  Although initially equipped with [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]]s, it soon reequipped with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.  It provided worldwide refueling until inactivated in 1994 as Loring was closed. \n\n==History==\n===Heavy bomber training===\n[[File:Alamogordo Army Airfield - B-24 Liberator 42-52161 over New Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|B-24 Liberator of a training unit in the southwest]]\nThe first predecessor of the squadron was the '''542d Bombardment Squadron''', which was activated at [[Salt Lake City Army Air Base]], Utah as one of the four original squadrons of the [[383d Bombardment Group]].  Its [[cadre (military)|cadre]] moved to [[Rapid City Army Air Base]] a little over a week later, where it began to equip as a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[Operational - Replacement Training Units#Operational Training Units|Operational Training Unit]] (OTU) the following year.<ref name=Maurer542BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 647</ref><ref name=Maurer383BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 270</ref> OTUs were oversized parent units that provided cadres to \"satellite groups\"<ref name=CCxxxvi> Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi</ref>\n\nIn October 1943, the squadron moved to [[Peterson Field]], Colorado, where it flew [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] and changed its mission to become a [[Operational - Replacement Training Units#Replacement Training Units|Replacement Training Unit]] (RTU).  Like OTUs, RTUs were oversized units, but their mission was to train individual [[aircrew]]s.<ref name=CCxxxvi/> However, the AAF was finding that standard military units like the 542d, which were based on relatively inflexible [[tables of organization]] were not well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit, which was manned and equipped for the specific training mission.<ref>Goss, p. 75</ref> As a result, the 383d Group, its elements and supporting units were inactivated or disbanded<ref name=Maurer542BS/><ref name=Maurer383BG/> and replaced by the 214th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School, Heavy), which was simultaneously organized at Peterson.\n\n===Air refueling operations===\n====KC-97 era====\nThe '''42d Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated at [[Limestone Air Force Base]] on 18 January 1955 and assigned to the [[42d Bombardment Wing]].  Although designated as a heavy squadron, it was equipped with [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]]s.  The squadron received its first KC-97 in February and was fully equipped by the end of the following month.  When it was activated, its parent [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] was equipped with the [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker]], which did not have an [[air refueling]] capability, so it focused on providing refueling support for other [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) units.  SAC had begun to include refueling in its war plans,<ref>Smith, p. 31</ref> and the squadron frequently deployed its tankers to forward locations, or deployed as a squadron , placing it ahead of the faster [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]]s it would refuel, and on their programmed route.<ref>''See'' Smith, p. 39</ref> It deployed to [[Thule Air Base]], Greenland; [[Sidi Slimane Air Base]], French Morocco; and [[Ernest Harmon Air Force Base|Ernest Harmon]] and [[Goose Air Base]]s, Labrador.<ref name=AFOOB/>\n\n====Conversion to KC-135s====\nIn August 1957, the squadron became nonoperational, as it began transferring its KC-97s to other units.  The arrival of replacement [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s, originally scheduled for August was delayed.  The first of the new planes did not arrive until October, and the squadron did not reach full strength until April 1958 and did not become combat ready until May.<ref name=AFOOB/> The [[bomber]] squadrons of the 42d Wing had begun to equip with [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft, and the KC-135 could deliver twice the amount of fuel to the B-52 without the fuel consumption caused by the descent and climb required to refuel with the KC-97.<ref>Smith, p. 45</ref> In June 1958, squadron planes began standing [[alert status|alert]].<ref name=AFOOB/> The percentage of SAC planes on alert gradually grew over the next two years.<ref>Narducci, p. 3</ref> Starting in 1960, one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen minute alert, fully fueled to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.  This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml |title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\nSoon after detection of Soviet missiles in Cuba, On 22 October 1962, 1/8 of SAC's B-52s were placed on airborne alert.  SAC placed additional KC-135s on alert to replace KC-135s devoted to maintaining the B-52 bomber force on airborne alert.  On 24 October SAC went to [[DEFCON]] 2, placing all aircraft on alert.<ref>Kipp, ''et al''., pp. 34\u201335</ref> Forward tankers at Loring were organized as a tanker task force.   Tanker crews from the 42d flew 214 air refueling missions during the crisis.<ref name=AFOOB/> As tensions eased, on 21 November, SAC returned to normal airborne alert posture and went to DEFCON 3. Dispersed tankers were recalled on 24 November. On 27 November SAC returned to normal alert posture.<ref>Kipp, ''et al''., pp. 47, 61</ref>\n\n====Refueling support in Southeast Asia and elsewhere====\nIn 1965, the squadron began to deploy aircraft and aircrew support for [[Operation Young Tiger]] operations in Southeast Asia.  This support for other units refueling combat operations in Southeast Asia continued until 1975.<ref name=AFOOB/><ref name=Ravenstein42BW>Ravenstein, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 5 September 1983, members of the 42d escorted a flight of [[McDonnell F-4E Phantom II]]s deploying across the Atlantic to a base in Germany.  One of the Phantoms experienced failure of one engine, and its second engine began to overheat.  It was diverted to [[Gander Airport]], Newfoundland, but could not maintain level flight.  Crew E-113 managed to connect its boom to the Phantom's refueling receptacle and literally tow the fighter back up to 10,000 feet above sea level.  The refueling was further complicated by the partial loss of hydraulics by the fighter, which caused it to fly while [[yaw]]ing.  The tanker refueled the fighter four times at speeds one hundred knots slower than normal refueling speed, with both planes near their stalling speed.<ref name=Bayly>{{cite news|last1=Bayly|first1=Julia|title=Fort Kent brothers recall years spent keeping planes flying at Loring|url= http://bangordailynews.com/2013/07/21/news/aroostook/fort-kent-brothers-recall-years-spent-keeping-planes-flying-at-loring/ |accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=21 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=White>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=J.

The squadron provided this support while converting from the KC-135A to the KC-135R. The first \"R\" model KC-135 arrived in May 1989, but the full conversion took around 12 months.<ref name=AFOOB/>\n\nDuring [[Desert Shield]] and Desert Storm, the squadron deployed aircrew and tankers to [[Lajes Air Base]], Azores, where it provided all aircrew and aircraft for the first three weeks of the operation. It also deployed personnel to France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Diego Garcia.<ref name=AFOOB/>\n\nIn September 1991, SAC implemented the Air Force's Objective Wing organization and the squadron was assigned to the newly-formed 42d Operations Group.  This assignment would last less than two years.  After SAC was disestablished in 1992, [[Air Mobility Command]] assumed air refueling operations and the squadron was reassigned to the [[380th Operations Group]].  However, the [[1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] had recommended the closure of Loring.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69.

With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

After completing his schooling, he started working alongside his father. He later took up employment at the Great Central Locomotive Depot, based at Mexborough.{{sfn|Gliddon|2014|pp=32\u201334}}\n\n==First World War==\nIn November 1915, Jackson enlisted in the [[British Army]] and, in October 1917, was posted to the 1st Battalion of the [[Coldstream Guards]], which was serving in France on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] at the time. He participated in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] the following month. He was later promoted to [[lance corporal]].{{sfn|Gliddon|2014|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nOn 27 September 1918, during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], the Coldstream Guards was engaged in the [[Battle of Canal du Nord]], near Graincourt.
