Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\">Rothbard, Murray N.

The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[List of libertarian political parties|libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military. However, others might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of \"state intervention\", defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and\u2014as the only entity in human society that derives its income from \"legal aggression\"\u2014an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\"/>\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the non-aggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis.

After property is transformed through labor, it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift \u2013 forced transfers are considered illegitimate (anarcho-capitalists do not consider wage labour to be a forced transfer). Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same \"absolute right\" as his own body, and retaining those rights forever, regardless if the resource is still being used by them. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it\u2014it is only by using land and by mixing one's labor with it that original appropriation is legitimized: \"Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be\". Rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the person's property as \"for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity\".<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\">Rothbard, Murray (1962).

Rothbard writes:\n\n{{quote|It is not enough to call simply for defense of \"the rights of private property\"; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be \"private\" must now be defended by libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>}}\n\nIn ''Justice and Property Right'', Rothbard writes that \"any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property\". In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases \"the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed\". He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the \"homestead principle\". If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and \"return to the private sector\", writing that \"any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible\". For example, he proposes that [[State university|state universities]] be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally \"private property\" if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers, writing: \"What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not 'private' property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property\". Likewise, Karl Hess says that \"libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private [...] Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system\".<ref>Hess, Karl (1969) ''[https://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf Letter From Washington]'' The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:\n\n{{quote|For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, rape, trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the ethics of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.<ref name=\"Hoppe-2002\"/>}}\n\n==== Common property ====\nAlthough anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers and portions of oceans.<ref name=\"Holcombe\">Holcombe, Randall G., [https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_1.pdf Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism], Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 19, No. 2 (Spring 2005):3\u201329.</ref> Anarchist theorist [[Roderick T.

''Formulations'' 5, no. 3 (Spring)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, since anarcho-capitalists believe that property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/> to the extent of the number of owners\u2014and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely\u2014anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional [[communal]] arrangements. [[Privatization]], [[decentralization]] and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. However, in some cases they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAnarcho-capitalists tend to concur with [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalists]] regarding the \"environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements\". Air, water and land pollution, for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. They believe that central governments generally strike down individual or [[class action]] censure of polluters in order to benefit \"the many\" and legal or economic [[subsidy]] of [[heavy industry]] is justified by many politicians for [[job creation]] within a political territory.<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/>\n\n=== Economics ===\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926\u20131995) coined the word anarcho-capitalism]]\nRothbard attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating \"private property anarchism\" in 1949 and later came up with the alternative name \"anarcho-capitalism\". He was probably the first to use \"libertarian\" in its current United States pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an anti-[[Statism|statist]] and anti-[[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]], but later had a falling-out. When interventionist [[Cold War]]riors of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], gained influence in the Republican Party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with left-wing [[antiwar]] groups. He believed that the Cold Warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to [[Trotskyist]] theory.<ref name=\"Rothbard\">Rothbard, Murray N.

Retrieved 10 September 2006.</ref> Rothbard opposed the founding of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists.\n\n=== Contractual society ===\n[[File:Althing-stamp.jpg|thumb|A postage stamp celebrating the thousandth anniversary of the Icelandic parliament\u2014according to a theory associated with the economist [[David D. Friedman]], medieval Icelandic society had some features of anarcho-capitalism; chieftaincies could be bought and sold and were not geographical monopolies; and individuals could voluntarily choose membership in any chieftain's clan]]\nThe society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the \"contractual society\"\u2014i.e. \"a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence\"<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\"/> in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements (contracts) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.\n\nOne particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer insurance and [[Bereavement benefit|death benefits]] to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]\u2014another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.\n\nRothbard argues that corporations would exist in a free society as they are \"simply the pooling of capital\". He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: \"Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation\".<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\"/> However, corporations created in this way would not be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that \"limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy & State with Power and Market, [https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11 Mises.org]</ref>\n\nThere are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]]<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\"/> and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will and which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.<ref name=\"Nozick-1973\">[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''</ref>\n\nIncluded in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, [[David D. Friedman]] has expressed preference for a society where \"almost everyone is self-employed\" and \"instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces\".<ref>Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper & Row. pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.\n\n=== Law and order and the use of violence ===\nDifferent anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Morris and Linda Tannehill object to any [[Statute|statutory]] law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see [[tort]]) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.<ref>Brown, Susan Love, ''The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View'', Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113.</ref> However, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, Rothbard supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.\n\nUnlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an [[ideological]] commonality of ethics and [[morality]] as a requirement, David D. Friedman proposes that \"the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars\".<ref name=\"koltwm\">Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom''. Second edition. La Salle, Ill, Open Court, pp. 116\u201317.</ref> Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society \"remains to be proven\". He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs, but he thinks this would be rare. He reasons that \"if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims, that law [...] will not survive in an anarcho-capitalist society\".<ref>Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism''. Harper & Row. pp. 127\u201328</ref>\n\nAnarcho-capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty (i.e. courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. However, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation, but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force\u2014that is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. If competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would also be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists. According to Molinari: \"Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries\".<ref name=\"Molinari-1849\">Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] ''(trans.

The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. [[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe prisons or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.<ref>O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf \"Retribution versus Restitution\"] Legal Notes No. 5, Libertarian Alliance {{ISBN|978-1-870614-22-1}} Retrieved 19 May 2005</ref>\n\n[[Bruce L. Benson]] argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, \"standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Bruce|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]]|year=1998|pages=235\u201338|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3}}</ref> The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. However, the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|url=https://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf|pages=105\u201306|isbn=978-0-930073-08-4|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|year=1993|publisher=Fox & Wilkes|location=San Francisco|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]]) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire the [[American Revolution]] as \"the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[Tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties\". In fact, according to Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N.

Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.<ref name=\"Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56\">Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56</ref> Unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on \"[[market failure]]\", but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see [[government failure]]) to compare the net result, nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark.<ref name=\"Friedman-1973\"/>\n\nKosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since in the absence of statutory law the [[non-aggression principle]] is naturally enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace.

Based on their understanding of anarchism, in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital, which they believe is a goal of those anarchists, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. They conclude that this body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is what anarcho-capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under a \"coercively\" egalitarian-anarchist system.<ref name=\"Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56\"/> On the other hand, anarchists argue that a state is required to maintain private property and for capitalism to function.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rocker |first=Rudolf |date=1938 |title=Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice.

Furthermore, he wrote: \"We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive.

Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]] while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] (''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]''), who wrote: \"The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else\". [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote: \"I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have\".<ref>Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Literature/Thoreau/CivilDisobedience.html Civil Disobedience]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The \"normative core\" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of ''laissez-faire'', a [[spontaneous order]] of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants.<ref>Razeen, Sally. ''Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History'', Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|978-0-415-16493-1}}, 1998, p. 17</ref> Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So they advocated what may be seen as{{weasel inline|date=July 2019}} classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. In the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same.\n\nIn his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: \"No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity\". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers \"had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism\".<ref>Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035217/http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm |date=10 June 2009 }}, Unit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e au CNRS</ref> Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society vs. state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.<ref name=\"Molinari-1849\"/> The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul \u00c9mile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the Old Right.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]] and [[H. L. Mencken]]. In the 1950s, the new \"fusion conservatism\", also called \"[[Cold War]] conservatism\", took hold of the right-wing in the United States, stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the Libertarian Party.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== 19th-century individualist anarchism in the United States ===\n{{main article|Individualist anarchism in the United States}}\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]] like [[Lysander Spooner]] (1808\u20131887) influenced anarcho-capitalism]]\nRothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]]<ref>\"[...] only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by these men.

He sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: \"There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung\".<ref name=autogenerated3>\"[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View], Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}} He held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.\n\nRothbard disagreed with this as he explains in ''The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View''. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Tucker held a labor theory of value and as a result he thought that in a free market people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or \"usury\" was taking place. As he explains in ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. As an Austrian economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory and believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to [[marginal utility]] rather than to labor amounts in the free market. He did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.\n\nOf particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of \"sovereignty of the individual\", a market economy and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the state. Tucker said: \"[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices\".<ref>Tucker, Benjamin. \"Instead of a Book\" (1893)</ref>\n\n== Historical precedents ==\nSeveral libertarians have discussed historical precedents of what they believe were examples of anarcho-capitalism.\n\n=== Free cities of medieval Europe ===\nEconomist and libertarian scholar [[Bryan Caplan]] cites the free cities of medieval Europe as important examples of anarchist or nearly anarchistic societies:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm|title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2|website=econfaculty.gmu.edu}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One case that has inspired both sorts of anarchists is that of the free cities of medieval Europe. The first weak link in the chain of feudalism, these free cities became Europe's centers of economic development, trade, art, and culture. They provided a haven for runaway serfs, who could often legally gain their freedom if they avoided re-capture for a year and a day. And they offer many examples of how people can form mutual-aid associations for protection, insurance, and community. Of course, left-anarchists and anarcho-capitalists take a somewhat different perspective on the free cities: the former emphasize the communitarian and egalitarian concerns of the free cities, while the latter point to the relatively unregulated nature of their markets and the wide range of services (often including defense, security, and legal services) which were provided privately or semi-privately.}}\n\n=== Medieval Iceland ===\n[[File:Law speaker.jpg|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as David D.

This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year. In addition to their parliamentary role, chieftains were empowered in their own local districts to appoint judges and to keep the peace; this latter job was handled on an essentially fee-for-service basis. The enforcement of judicial decisions was largely a matter of self-help (hence Iceland's reputation as a land of constant private feuding), but those who lacked the might to enforce their rights could sell their court-decreed claims for compensation to someone more powerful, usually a chieftain; hence even the poor and friendless could not be victimized with impunity. The basis of a chieftain's power within the political order was the power he already possessed outside it, in civil society. The office of chieftaincy was private property, and could be bought or sold; hence chieftaincies tended to track private wealth. But wealth alone was not enough. As economic historian Birgir Solvason notes in his masterful study of the period, \"just buying the chieftainship was no guarantee of power\"; the mere office by itself was \"almost worthless\" unless the chieftain could \"convince some free-farmers to follow him\". Chieftains did not hold authority over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with other chieftains from the same geographical area.}}\n\nLong observes how the system of free contract between farmers and chieftains was threatened when harassment from Norwegian kings that began around AD 1000 forced the people of Iceland to accept Christianity as the national religion, which paved the way for the introduction of a compulsory tax in AD 1096 which was to be paid to the local chieftain who owned a churchstead. This, he believes, gave an unfair advantage to some chieftains who at least in part did not need to rely upon the voluntary support of their clients in order to receive some income. This gradually lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few big chieftains, enabling them to restrict competition and eventually establish effective monopolies. Although the Commonwealth was politically stable for over three centuries,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} longer than any democracy has lasted,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} its eventual downfall was brought about according to Long \"not through having too much privatization, but through having too little\".<ref name=\"lewrockwell.com\"/> He notes:\n\n{{quote|[T]he Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament \u2013 i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall \u2013 while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.}}\n\n=== American Old West ===\nAccording to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that \"private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved\" and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.<ref>Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P.

From these twin axioms \u2013 self-ownership and \"homesteading\" \u2013 stem the justification for the entire system of property rights titles in a free-market society.

Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\">Rothbard, Murray N.

The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians, such as most people involved in [[List of libertarian political parties|libertarian political parties]], would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military. However, others might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of \"state intervention\", defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and\u2014as the only entity in human society that derives its income from \"legal aggression\"\u2014an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\"/>\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the non-aggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis. It is in terms of the [[non-aggression principle]] that Rothbard defined anarchism, \"a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']\"; and wrote that \"what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray N.

In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in John Locke's phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary&nbsp;\u2013 contractual&nbsp;\u2013 transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.<ref name=\"Hoppe-2002\">Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2002) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe7.html \"Rothbardian Ethics\"] Retrieved 23 May 2005</ref>}}\n\n{|class=\"box\" style=\"float:right; margin:15px; text-align:left; border:3px solid #aaa; padding:4px; font-size:85%; width:240px;\"\n|-\n||\nAnarcho-capitalism uses the following terms in ways that may differ from common usage or various anarchist movements.\n* Anarchism: any philosophy that opposes all forms of initiatory coercion (includes opposition to the state)\n* Contract: a voluntary binding agreement between persons\n* Coercion: physical force or threat of such against persons or property\n* Capitalism: economic system where the means of production are privately owned and where investments, production, distribution, income and prices are determined through the operation of a free market rather than by statutory regulation\n* Free market: a market where all decisions regarding transfer of money, goods (including capital goods) and services are voluntary\n* Fraud: inducing one to part with something of value through the use of dishonesty\n* State: an organization that taxes and engages in regularized and institutionalized aggressive coercion\n* Voluntary: any action not influenced by coercion or fraud perpetrated by any human agency\n|}\nThe root of anarcho-capitalist [[property rights]] differ from that of anarchism, especially forms of anarchism such as [[anarcho-communism]], where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed \"according to need\" (which is to be determined and enforced collectively).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e. private) ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual \"needs\" or does not \"need\". After property is transformed through labor, it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift \u2013 forced transfers are considered illegitimate (anarcho-capitalists do not consider wage labour to be a forced transfer). Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same \"absolute right\" as his own body, and retaining those rights forever, regardless if the resource is still being used by them. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it\u2014it is only by using land and by mixing one's labor with it that original appropriation is legitimized: \"Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be\". Rothbard argues that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the person's property as \"for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity\".<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\">Rothbard, Murray (1962).

Rothbard writes:\n\n{{quote|It is not enough to call simply for defense of \"the rights of private property\"; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be \"private\" must now be defended by libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>}}\n\nIn ''Justice and Property Right'', Rothbard writes that \"any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property\". In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases \"the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed\". He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the \"homestead principle\". If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and \"return to the private sector\", writing that \"any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible\". For example, he proposes that [[State university|state universities]] be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally \"private property\" if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers, writing: \"What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not 'private' property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property\". Likewise, Karl Hess says that \"libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private [...] Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system\".<ref>Hess, Karl (1969) ''[https://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf Letter From Washington]'' The Libertatian Forum Vol. I, No. VI (15 June 1969) Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:\n\n{{quote|For, apart from ruling out as unjustified all activities such as murder, homicide, rape, trespass, robbery, burglary, theft, and fraud, the ethics of private property is also incompatible with the existence of a state defined as an agency that possesses a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making (jurisdiction) and/or the right to tax.<ref name=\"Hoppe-2002\"/>}}\n\n==== Common property ====\nAlthough anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own.

The cleared path is the product of labor&nbsp;\u2013 not any individual's labor, but all of them together. If one villager decided to take advantage of the now-created path by setting up a gate and charging tolls, he would be violating the collective property right that the villagers together have earned.<ref>Long, Roderick T. 199. \"A Plea for Public Property\". ''Formulations'' 5, no. 3 (Spring)</ref>}}\n\nNevertheless, since anarcho-capitalists believe that property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/> to the extent of the number of owners\u2014and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely\u2014anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional [[communal]] arrangements. [[Privatization]], [[decentralization]] and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. However, in some cases they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAnarcho-capitalists tend to concur with [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalists]] regarding the \"environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements\". Air, water and land pollution, for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. They believe that central governments generally strike down individual or [[class action]] censure of polluters in order to benefit \"the many\" and legal or economic [[subsidy]] of [[heavy industry]] is justified by many politicians for [[job creation]] within a political territory.<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/>\n\n=== Economics ===\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murray Rothbard]] (1926\u20131995) coined the word anarcho-capitalism]]\nRothbard attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism.

He was probably the first to use \"libertarian\" in its current United States pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an anti-[[Statism|statist]] and anti-[[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with [[Ayn Rand]], but later had a falling-out. When interventionist [[Cold War]]riors of the ''[[National Review]]'', such as [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], gained influence in the Republican Party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with left-wing [[antiwar]] groups. He believed that the Cold Warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to [[Trotskyist]] theory.<ref name=\"Rothbard\">Rothbard, Murray N.

Friedman]], medieval Icelandic society had some features of anarcho-capitalism; chieftaincies could be bought and sold and were not geographical monopolies; and individuals could voluntarily choose membership in any chieftain's clan]]\nThe society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the \"contractual society\"\u2014i.e. \"a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence\"<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\"/> in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements (contracts) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.\n\nOne particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer insurance and [[Bereavement benefit|death benefits]] to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]\u2014another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.\n\nRothbard argues that corporations would exist in a free society as they are \"simply the pooling of capital\". He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: \"Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation\".<ref name=\"Rothbard-1962\"/> However, corporations created in this way would not be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that \"limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray N. (1962) Man, Economy & State with Power and Market, [https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp#_ftn11 Mises.org]</ref>\n\nThere are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in [[inalienable rights|inalienable human rights]]<ref name=\"Rothbard-1982.2\"/> and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will and which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured [[slavery]]. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.<ref name=\"Nozick-1973\">[[Robert Nozick|Nozick, Robert]] (1973) ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia''</ref>\n\nIncluded in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, [[David D. Friedman]] has expressed preference for a society where \"almost everyone is self-employed\" and \"instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces\".<ref>Friedman, David. The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism. Harper & Row. pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.\n\n=== Law and order and the use of violence ===\nDifferent anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Morris and Linda Tannehill object to any [[Statute|statutory]] law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see [[tort]]) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong.<ref>Brown, Susan Love, ''The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View'', Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 113.</ref> However, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, Rothbard supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.\n\nUnlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an [[ideological]] commonality of ethics and [[morality]] as a requirement, David D. Friedman proposes that \"the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars\".<ref name=\"koltwm\">Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom''. Second edition. La Salle, Ill, Open Court, pp. 116\u201317.</ref> Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society \"remains to be proven\". He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs, but he thinks this would be rare. He reasons that \"if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims, that law [...] will not survive in an anarcho-capitalist society\".<ref>Friedman, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism''. Harper & Row. pp. 127\u201328</ref>\n\nAnarcho-capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty (i.e. courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. However, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation, but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force\u2014that is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. If competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would also be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists. According to Molinari: \"Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries\".<ref name=\"Molinari-1849\">Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] ''(trans.

The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. [[Retributive justice]], meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe prisons or [[indentured servitude]] would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations while others believe [[exile]] or forced [[restitution]] are sufficient.<ref>O'Keeffe, Matthew (1989) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan005.pdf \"Retribution versus Restitution\"] Legal Notes No. 5, Libertarian Alliance {{ISBN|978-1-870614-22-1}} Retrieved 19 May 2005</ref>\n\n[[Bruce L. Benson]] argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, \"standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Bruce|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]]|year=1998|pages=235\u201338|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3}}</ref> The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. However, the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|url=https://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf|pages=105\u201306|isbn=978-0-930073-08-4|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|year=1993|publisher=Fox & Wilkes|location=San Francisco|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]]) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire the [[American Revolution]] as \"the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against [[Tyranny|tyrannical]] restrictions of their liberties\". In fact, according to Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.<ref>Rothbard, Murray N.

Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''.<ref name=\"Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56\">Tame, Chris R. October 1983. The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties. Economic Affairs. p. 56</ref> Unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on \"[[market failure]]\", but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see [[government failure]]) to compare the net result, nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark.<ref name=\"Friedman-1973\"/>\n\nKosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since in the absence of statutory law the [[non-aggression principle]] is naturally enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace. For him, the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state, or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form.<ref name=\"libertarianpapers\"/>\n\n== Anarchism and capitalism ==\n{{main article|Anarchism and capitalism}}\n[[File:Flag of Anarcho-capitalism.svg|thumb|The black and gold flag, symbol of anarchism (black) and capitalism (gold), was first flown in 1963 in Colorado<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]], ''[https://mises.org/library/betrayal-american-right-0 The Betrayal of the American Right]'' (2007): 188</ref> and is also used by the Swedish ''AnarkoKapitalistisk Front''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/se-pol.html#akf|title=Flags of political parties (Sweden)|publisher=FOTW Flags Of The World website|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>]]\nIn both its [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist]] forms, anarchism is usually considered a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing]] and [[anti-capitalist]] ideology that promotes socialist economic theories such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[communism]], [[syndicalism]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].<ref name=brooks>{{cite book |quote=Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism, from the hyperrationalism of Godwin, to the egoism of Stirner, to the libertarians and anarcho-capitalists of today |last=Brooks |first=Frank H. |year=1994 |title=The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881\u20131908) |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page=xi|isbn=1-56000-132-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Joseph Kahn|title= Anarchism, the Creed That Won't Stay Dead; The Spread of World Capitalism Resurrects a Long-Dormant Movement |year=2000|journal=[[The New York Times]]|issue=5 August |ref=harv}}{{cite journal |author=Colin Moynihan |title=Book Fair Unites Anarchists.

[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard]. ''The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal''.</ref> According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society, such as cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses and so on.\n\nMoreover, anarcho-capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of anarchist ideals as advocated by what they term \"[[left-wing anarchists]]\" would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. Based on their understanding of anarchism, in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital, which they believe is a goal of those anarchists, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. They conclude that this body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is what anarcho-capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under a \"coercively\" egalitarian-anarchist system.<ref name=\"Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56\"/> On the other hand, anarchists argue that a state is required to maintain private property and for capitalism to function.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rocker |first=Rudolf |date=1938 |title=Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice.

That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines\". Furthermore, he wrote: \"We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive.

Classical liberals have had two main themes since [[John Locke]] first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of [[natural rights]] while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a [[consent theory]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] (''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]''), who wrote: \"The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else\". [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote: \"I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have\".<ref>Thoreau, Henry David (1849) [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Literature/Thoreau/CivilDisobedience.html Civil Disobedience]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The \"normative core\" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of ''laissez-faire'', a [[spontaneous order]] of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants.<ref>Razeen, Sally. ''Classical Liberalism and International Economic Order: Studies in Theory and Intellectual History'', Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|978-0-415-16493-1}}, 1998, p. 17</ref> Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So they advocated what may be seen as{{weasel inline|date=July 2019}} classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. In the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same.\n\nIn his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: \"No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity\". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers \"had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism\".<ref>Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035217/http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm |date=10 June 2009 }}, Unit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e au CNRS</ref> Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society vs. state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.<ref name=\"Molinari-1849\"/> The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul \u00c9mile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the Old Right.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists and (later) anti-[[New Deal]]ers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Garet Garrett]] and [[H. L. Mencken]]. In the 1950s, the new \"fusion conservatism\", also called \"[[Cold War]] conservatism\", took hold of the right-wing in the United States, stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the Libertarian Party.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== 19th-century individualist anarchism in the United States ===\n{{main article|Individualist anarchism in the United States}}\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]] like [[Lysander Spooner]] (1808\u20131887) influenced anarcho-capitalism]]\nRothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchists]]<ref>\"[...] only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by these men.

He sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: \"There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung\".<ref name=autogenerated3>\"[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View], Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 20, no. 1, p. 7 (1965, 2000)</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}} He held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.\n\nRothbard disagreed with this as he explains in ''The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View''. He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Tucker held a labor theory of value and as a result he thought that in a free market people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or \"usury\" was taking place. As he explains in ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. As an Austrian economist, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory and believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to [[marginal utility]] rather than to labor amounts in the free market. He did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.\n\nOf particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of \"sovereignty of the individual\", a market economy and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the state. Tucker said: \"[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices\".<ref>Tucker, Benjamin. \"Instead of a Book\" (1893)</ref>\n\n== Historical precedents ==\nSeveral libertarians have discussed historical precedents of what they believe were examples of anarcho-capitalism.\n\n=== Free cities of medieval Europe ===\nEconomist and libertarian scholar [[Bryan Caplan]] cites the free cities of medieval Europe as important examples of anarchist or nearly anarchistic societies:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm|title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2|website=econfaculty.gmu.edu}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One case that has inspired both sorts of anarchists is that of the free cities of medieval Europe.

Of course, left-anarchists and anarcho-capitalists take a somewhat different perspective on the free cities: the former emphasize the communitarian and egalitarian concerns of the free cities, while the latter point to the relatively unregulated nature of their markets and the wide range of services (often including defense, security, and legal services) which were provided privately or semi-privately.}}\n\n=== Medieval Iceland ===\n[[File:Law speaker.jpg|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as David D.

This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year. In addition to their parliamentary role, chieftains were empowered in their own local districts to appoint judges and to keep the peace; this latter job was handled on an essentially fee-for-service basis. The enforcement of judicial decisions was largely a matter of self-help (hence Iceland's reputation as a land of constant private feuding), but those who lacked the might to enforce their rights could sell their court-decreed claims for compensation to someone more powerful, usually a chieftain; hence even the poor and friendless could not be victimized with impunity. The basis of a chieftain's power within the political order was the power he already possessed outside it, in civil society. The office of chieftaincy was private property, and could be bought or sold; hence chieftaincies tended to track private wealth. But wealth alone was not enough. As economic historian Birgir Solvason notes in his masterful study of the period, \"just buying the chieftainship was no guarantee of power\"; the mere office by itself was \"almost worthless\" unless the chieftain could \"convince some free-farmers to follow him\". Chieftains did not hold authority over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with other chieftains from the same geographical area.}}\n\nLong observes how the system of free contract between farmers and chieftains was threatened when harassment from Norwegian kings that began around AD 1000 forced the people of Iceland to accept Christianity as the national religion, which paved the way for the introduction of a compulsory tax in AD 1096 which was to be paid to the local chieftain who owned a churchstead. This, he believes, gave an unfair advantage to some chieftains who at least in part did not need to rely upon the voluntary support of their clients in order to receive some income. This gradually lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few big chieftains, enabling them to restrict competition and eventually establish effective monopolies. Although the Commonwealth was politically stable for over three centuries,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} longer than any democracy has lasted,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} its eventual downfall was brought about according to Long \"not through having too much privatization, but through having too little\".<ref name=\"lewrockwell.com\"/> He notes:\n\n{{quote|[T]he Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament \u2013 i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall \u2013 while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.}}\n\n=== American Old West ===\nAccording to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that \"private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved\" and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.<ref>Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P.
