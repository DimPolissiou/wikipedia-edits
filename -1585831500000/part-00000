On Sanday, an on-demand public minibus service allows connecting to the ferry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Picts]] were the pre-Norse inhabitants of Sanday but very few placenames remain from this period.<ref>Waugh, Doreen \"Orkney Place-names\" in Omand (2003) p. 115</ref> The Norse named the island ''Sandey''<ref name=Anderson/> or ''Sand-\u00f8y''<ref name=Smith392/> because of the predominance of sandy [[beach]]es and this became \"Sanday\" during the [[Scots language|Scots]] and English speaking periods. The similarly named [[Sandoy]] is in the [[Faroe Islands]].\n\nMany names of places and natural features derive from [[Old Norse]]. According to Dorward (1995), the placename Kettletoft means \"[[Kettil]]'s [[croft (land)|croft]]\"<ref>Dorward (1995) p. 42</ref> although \"toft\" in this context may mean \"\"abandoned site of house\" from the Norse ''topt''.<ref name=Orkhouse>[http://www.orkneyjar.com/placenames/pl-hoose.htm \"Orkney Placenames: Houses, Farms and Building\"]<!-- sic --> Orkneyjar.

It is divided naturally into two roughly equal halves by Otterswick, a bay which runs in from the north,\tand Kettletoft Bay in the south. The narrow [[isthmus]] between them formed the boundary between the historic parishes  Cross and Burness to the west and Lady to the east.<ref name=Steiness41>Steinnes (1959) p. 41</ref> The novelist [[Eric Linklater]] described Sanday's shape seen from the air as being like that of a giant fossilised bat.<ref name=Smith392/>\n\nChanging post-glacial sea levels will have much altered the shape of this low-lying island since the last [[ice age]]. William Traill described a gale in 1838 which removed {{convert|20|ha}} of sand in Otterswick Bay. This revealed a dark layer of decayed vegetation under fallen trees up to {{convert|60|cm}} in diameter. The trees lay \"as if felled by a storm\" and were visible under the sea for {{convert|6.5|km}}. A search for these tree remains  in the 20th century was unsuccessful.<ref>Keatinge and Dickson (1979) p. 587</ref>\n\nInland it is fertile and [[agricultural]] and there is some commercial lobster fishing.

It is divided naturally into two roughly equal halves by Otterswick, a bay which runs in from the north,\tand Kettletoft Bay in the south. The narrow [[isthmus]] between them formed the boundary between the historic parishes  Cross and Burness to the west and Lady to the east.<ref name=Steiness41>Steinnes (1959) p. 41</ref> The novelist [[Eric Linklater]] described Sanday's shape seen from the air as being like that of a giant fossilised bat.<ref name=Smith392/>\n\nChanging post-glacial sea levels will have much altered the shape of this low-lying island since the last [[ice age]].

Ideologically, he initially adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]] although by the early 1990s had moved toward [[social democracy]].\n\nOf mixed Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Gorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]] to a poor peasant family. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[collective farm]] before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a [[one-party state]] according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 prior to receiving his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organisation and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[Destalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Sevastopol Regional Committee in 1970, in which position he oversaw construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978 he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], following the brief regimes of the \u00a8old guys\u00a8 [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected Gorbachev as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' head of government, in 1985.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and to its [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary, particularly after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He withdrew from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralise economic decision making to improve efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries abandoned Marxist-Leninist governance in 1989\u201390. Internally, growing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist-Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the wake of this, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes and he resigned. After leaving office, he launched his [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian Presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century, Gorbachev remains the subject of controversy. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014he was widely praised for his pivotal role in ending the Cold War, curtailing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe]] and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Conversely, in Russia he is often derided for not stopping the Soviet collapse, an event which brought a decline in Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic crisis.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]], then in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from [[Chernigov]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}}\nHis parents named him Victor, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergei's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]].

It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=312}} That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the [[Supreme Soviet]] passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=239|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=313}} Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=434\u2013435, 449\u2013450}} These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=450}}\n\nBy 1987, the ethos of glasnost had spread through Soviet society: journalists were writing increasingly openly,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} many economic problems were being publicly revealed,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=338\u2013339}} and studies appeared that critically reassessed Soviet history.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=317}} Gorbachev was broadly supportive, describing glasnost as \"the crucial, irreplaceable weapon of perestroika\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} He nevertheless insisted that people should use the newfound freedom responsibly, stating that journalists and writers should avoid \"sensationalism\" and be \"completely objective\" in their reporting.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=315}} Nearly two hundred previously restricted Soviet films were publicly released, and a range of Western films were also made available.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=151|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=341}} In 1989, Soviet culpability for the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was finally revealed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=131}}\n\nIn September 1987, the government stopped jamming the signal of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Voice of America]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=217|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=397}} The reforms also included greater tolerance of religion;{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=74|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} an [[Easter]] service was broadcast on Soviet television for the first time and the millennium celebrations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were given media attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=290|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} Independent organisations appeared, most supportive of Gorbachev, although the largest, [[Pamyat]], was ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic in nature.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|pp=186\u2013187}} Gorbachev also announced that Soviet Jews wishing to migrate to Israel would be allowed to do so, something previously prohibited.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=195}}\n\nIn August 1987, he holidayed in [[Nizhniaia Oreanda]], Ukraine, there writing ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and Our World'' at the suggestion of U.S. publishers.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=246|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=319}} For the 70th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917\u2014which brought Lenin and the Communist Party to power\u2014Gorbachev produced a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\".

While the soviets had become largely powerless bodies that rubber-stamped Politburo policies, he wanted them to become year-round legislatures.

Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist-Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism-Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party

self-conscious\",{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=16}} noting that unlike most Russian intelligentsia, Gorbachev was not closely connected \"to the world of science, culture, the arts, or education\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=150}}  When living in Stavropol he and his wife collected hundreds of books.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=114\u2013115}} Among his favourite authors were [[Arthur

natural environments,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=163}} and was also a fan of [[association football]].{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=347}} He favoured small gatherings where the assembled discussed topics like

Trotsky]].{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=43}} Medvedev also considered Gorbachev \"a charismatic leader\", something Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko had not been.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=165}} Doder and Branson called him \"a charmer capable of intellectually seducing doubters, always trying to co-opt them, or at least blunt the edge of their criticism\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=287}} McCauley thought Gorbachev displayed \"great tactical skill\" in manoeuvring successfully between hardline Marxist-Leninists and liberalisers for most of his time as leader, although added that he was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because he was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\nDoder and Branson thought Gorbachev \"a Russian to the core, intensely patriotic as only people living in the border regions can be.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}} \nTaubman also noted that the former Soviet leader has a \"sense of self-importance and self-righteousness\" as well as a \"need for attention and admiration\" which grated on some of his colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=134}} He was sensitive to personal criticism and easily took offense.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=161|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=134, 135}} Colleagues were often frustrated that he would leave tasks unfinished,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=117}} and sometimes also felt underappreciated and discarded by him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=273}} Biographers Doder and Branson thought that Gorbachev was \"a puritan\" with \"a proclivity for order in his personal life\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=14}} Taubman noted that he was \"capable of blowing up for calculated effect\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=516}} He also thought that by 1990, when his domestic popularity was waning, Gorbachev become \"psychologically dependent on being lionized abroad\", a trait for which he was criticised in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=541}} McCauley was of the view that \"one of his weaknesses was an inability to foresee the consequences of his actions\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=161}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nOpinions on Gorbachev are deeply divided.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=1}} Many, particularly in Western countries, see him as the greatest statesman of the second half of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=1, 539}} U.S. press referred to the presence of \"Gorbymania\" in Western countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as represented by large crowds that turned out to greet his visits,{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=286|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=138}} with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine naming him its \"Man of the Decade\" in the 1980s.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=391}} In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=267}} For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=396}} and to build a form of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=410}} Taubman characterised Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world\u2014though neither as much as he wished.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=687}} McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something precious, the right to think and manage their lives for themselves\", with all the uncertainty and risk that that entailed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=278\u2013279}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Gorbachev succeeded in destroying what was left of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union; he brought freedom of speech, of assembly, and of conscience to people who had never known it, except perhaps for a few chaotic months in 1917.

It is more the fault of the raw material he worked with than of his own real shortcomings and mistakes that Russian democracy will take much longer to build than he thought.\n| source=\u2014 Gorbachev biographer William Taubman, 2017{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}}\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nGorbachev's negotiations with the U.S. helped bring an end to the Cold War and reduced the threat of nuclear conflict.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} His decision to allow the Eastern Bloc to break apart prevented significant bloodshed in Central and Eastern Europe; as Taubman noted, this meant that the \"[[Soviet Empire]]\" ended in a far more peaceful manner than the [[British Empire]] several decades before.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Similarly, under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union broke apart without falling into civil war, as happened during the breakup of Yugoslavia at the same time.{{sfnm|1a1=Bunce|1y=1992|1p=205|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=275}} McCauley noted that in facilitating the merger of East and West Germany, Gorbachev was \"a co-father of German unification\", assuring him long-term popularity among the German people.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=197}}\n\nHe also faced domestic criticism during his rule. During his career, Gorbachev attracted the admiration of some colleagues, but others came to hate him.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=134}} Across society more broadly, his inability to reverse the decline in the Soviet economy brought discontent.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=388}} Liberals thought he lacked the radicalism to really break from Marxism-Leninism and establish a free market liberal democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=416|2a1=Steele|2y=1996|2p=145}} Conversely, many of his Communist Party critics thought his reforms were reckless and threatened the survival of Soviet socialism;{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=324}} some believed he should have followed the example of China's Communist Party and restricted himself to economic rather than governmental reforms.{{sfn|Steele|1996|p=145}} Many Russians saw his emphasis on persuasion rather than force as a sign of weakness.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\n\nFor much of the Communist Party nomenklatura, the Soviet Union's dissolution was disastrous as it resulted in their loss of power.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=276}} In Russia, he is widely despised for his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic collapse.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=1}} General Varennikov, one of those who orchestrated the 1991 coup attempt against Gorbachev, for instance called him \"a renegade and traitor to your own people\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=659}} Many of his critics attacked him for allowing the Marxist-Leninist governments across Eastern Europe to fall,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=268}} and for allowing a reunited Germany to join NATO, something they deem to be contrary to Russia's national interest.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=691}}\n\nThe historian Mark Galeotti stressed the connection between Gorbachev and his predecessor, Andropov. In Galeotti's view, Andropov was \"the godfather of the Gorbachev revolution\", because\u2014as a former head of the KGB\u2014he was able to put forward the case for reform without having his loyalty to the Soviet cause questioned, an approach that Gorbachev was able to build on and follow through with.{{sfn|Galeotti|1997|p=35}} According to McCauley, Gorbachev \"set reforms in motion without understanding where they could lead.

The [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|eighth and last leader]] of the [[Soviet Union]], he was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1985 until 1991. He was also the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991, serving as the chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] from 1988 to 1989, chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] from 1989 to 1990, and [[president of the Soviet Union]] from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, he initially adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]] although by the early 1990s had moved toward [[social democracy]].\n\nOf mixed Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Gorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]] to a poor peasant family. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[collective farm]] before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a [[one-party state]] according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 prior to receiving his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organisation and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[Desalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Sevastopol Regional Committee in 1970, in which position he oversaw construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978 he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], following the brief regimes of the \u00a8old guys\u00a8 [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected Gorbachev as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' head of government, in 1985.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and to its [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary, particularly after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He withdrew from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralise economic decision making to improve efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries abandoned Marxist-Leninist governance in 1989\u201390. Internally, growing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist-Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the wake of this, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes and he resigned. After leaving office, he launched his [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian Presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century, Gorbachev remains the subject of controversy. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014he was widely praised for his pivotal role in ending the Cold War, curtailing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe]] and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Conversely, in Russia he is often derided for not stopping the Soviet collapse, an event which brought a decline in Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic crisis.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]], then in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from [[Chernigov]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}}\nHis parents named him Victor, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergei's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]].

Gorbachev (close-up).jpg|thumb|left|Gorbachev in 1987]]\n\nGorbachev's political outlook was shaped by the 23 years he served as a party official in Stavropol.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}} Doder and Branson thought that throughout most of his political career prior to becoming General Secretary, \"his publicly expressed views almost certainly reflected a politician's understanding of what should be said, rather than his personal philosophy. Otherwise he could not have survived politically.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=9}} \nLike many Russians, Gorbachev sometimes thought of the Soviet Union as being largely synonymous with Russia and in various speeches described it as \"Russia\"; in one incident he had to correct himself after calling the USSR \"Russia\" while giving a speech in Kiev, Ukraine.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}}\n\nMcCauley noted that perestroika was \"an elusive concept\", one which \"evolved and eventually meant something radically different over time.\"{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=262\u2013263}} McCauley stated that the concept originally referred to \"radical reform of the economic and political system\" as part of Gorbachev's attempt to motivate the labour force and make management more effective.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} It was only after initial measures to achieve this proved unsuccessful that Gorbachev began to consider market mechanisms and co-operatives, albeit with the state sector remaining dominant.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} The political scientist John Gooding suggested that had the perestroika reforms succeeded, the Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist-Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism-Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party

Gorbachev displayed \"great tactical skill\" in manoeuvring successfully between hardline Marxist-Leninists and liberalisers for most of his time as leader, although added that he was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because he was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\nDoder and Branson

1980s.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=391}} In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=267}} For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=396}} and to build a form of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=410}} Taubman characterised Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world\u2014though neither as much as he wished.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=687}} McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire Council]] as another unitary authority. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n\n|'''[[Buckinghamshire Council|Buckinghamshire]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Amersham]], [[Chesham]], [[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||505,283||1565&nbsp;km\u00b2||323/km\u00b2||530,800\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services were split between the county council and a number of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]].

This dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when swans were bred in Buckinghamshire for the king's pleasure. That the swan is in chains illustrates that [[Swan upping|the swan is bound to the monarch]], an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a [[beech]] tree, representing the [[Chiltern Forest]] that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a [[Deer|buck]], for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.\n\nThe motto of the shield is ''Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum''.

Buckinghamshire Council is one of the few remaining [[Local Education Authority|LEA]]s still using the [[Tripartite system of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|tripartite system]], albeit with some revisions such as the abolition of [[secondary technical school]]s. It has a completely selective education system: pupils transfer either to a [[grammar school]] or to a [[secondary modern school]] or [[Free school (England)|free school]] depending on how they perform in the [[Eleven-Plus exam]] and on their preferences. Pupils who do not take the test can only be allocated places at secondary modern schools or free school. There are 9 independent schools and 34 maintained (state) secondary schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s, in the county council area. There is also the [[Buckinghamshire University Technical College]] which offers secondary education from age 14. The unitary authority of Milton Keynes operates a [[comprehensive education]] system: there are 8 maintained (state) secondary schools in the borough council area.\n\nBuckinghamshire is also home to the [[University of Buckingham]], [[Buckinghamshire New University]], the [[National Film and Television School]], the [[Open University]] and the [[University Campus Milton Keynes]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:John Milton's cottage.jpg|thumb|John Milton's cottage, Chalfont]]\n[[File:House from rear (9058754955).jpg|thumb|[[Cliveden]]]]\n[[File:Buckingham Church - geograph.org.uk - 715502.jpg|thumb|Buckingham church seen from across the [[River Great Ouse|Ouse]]]]\nBuckinghamshire is the birthplace and/or final resting place of several notable individuals.

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire Council]] as another unitary authority. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n\n|'''[[Buckinghamshire Council|Buckinghamshire]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Amersham]], [[Chesham]], [[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||505,283||1565&nbsp;km\u00b2||323/km\u00b2||530,800\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services were split between the county council and a number of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]]. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nIn 1997 the northernmost<ref>The part of Buckinghamshire north of the [[Varsity Line]] together with [[Bow Brickhill]], [[Woburn Sands]] and parts of [[Bletchley and Fenny Stratford]].</ref> part of Buckinghamshire, then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; for ceremonial purposes Milton Keynes remains part of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK \n  | type = act\n  | year = 1997\n  | chapter = 23\n  | act = Lieutenancies Act 1997\n}}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provided a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum|County Museum]] and the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.\n\n===Buckinghamshire Council (2020 onwards) ===\n[[Buckinghamshire Council]] is a unitary authority covering most of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bucks County Council takes final curtain call after 131 years |url=https://www.bucksherald.co.uk/news/politics/council/bucks-county-council-takes-final-curtain-call-after-131-years-2451714 |website=Bucks Herald |accessdate=28 March 2020 |date=16 March 2020}}</ref> It was created in April 2020 from the areas that were previously administered by [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and districts of [[South Bucks]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]], [[Aylesbury Vale]]. \n\n===Milton Keynes Council===\n[[Milton Keynes Council]] was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council.

This dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when swans were bred in Buckinghamshire for the king's pleasure. That the swan is in chains illustrates that [[Swan upping|the swan is bound to the monarch]], an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county.

Grimes]], proposed that what was needed was a membership society<ref name=\"IJNA 10 4 NAS\">{{cite journal | last = Flinder | first = Alex |author2=Margaret Rule | title = The Nautical Archaeology Society | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 273 | date = November 1981 | publisher=Academic Press|location=London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00040.x}}</ref> but this took some years to establish. The CNA and the Trust eventually agreed the form of constitution of such a Society and the inaugural meeting took place in 1981. The intention of the Society was to act as a forum for the interchange of ideas and all of the associates and subscribers of the Trust were transferred to full membership the Society. The specific intention was to further cooperation between amateurs and professionals and its impact spread beyond the UK with a third of the new membership in its first year being from outside the UK.<ref name=\"IJNA 10 4 Editorial\">{{cite journal | last = Morrison | first = Ian | title = Editorial | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 271\u20132 | date = November 1981 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00039.x}}</ref>  [[Joan du Plat Taylor]] was the first president.\n\nFor a few years from 1981, the activities of the charity (the Trust) were separated from the interchange between the members (the Society) although both had identical aims, but the situation was resolved by a special meeting of the Trust held on 3 July 1986 at the Science Museum.<ref name=\"IJNA 15 3 Editorial\">{{cite journal | last = Fenwick | first = Valerie | title = Editorial | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 177 | date = August 1986 | publisher=Academic Press|location=London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1986.tb00572.x}}</ref> At this meeting, the members of the Trust voted to change the name of the Trust to the Nautical Archaeology Society and to change the constitution (the articles of association) to reflect the change to a membership organisation.<ref name=\"cohouse\" />  The reconstituted organisation continued to have responsibility for producing the IJNA and a clause safeguarding the academic standards of the journal was added to the articles.  The renamed Trust thus subsumed the role of providing a forum for the interchange of ideas and the memberships of those who had participated in the Society (many of whom were in any case the original associates and subscribers of the Trust) transferred to membership of the incorporated body.\n\n===The beginning of NAS training===\nWith the dual advantages of a participatory membership and its status as a registered charity, in 1986 the newly reconstituted Nautical Archaeology Society ran the first events in what later became its four-part internationally accredited training syllabus.\n\n==NAS training and education==\n\n===NAS training in the UK===\nThe society educates and trains professional and avocational [[archaeologist]]s and [[Professional diving|commercial]] and [[Recreational diving|recreational divers]].<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1283 English Heritage Protected wrecks website] \u2013 recommendation to use NAS training.</ref> The aim of the NAS training syllabus is to develop awareness, respect for and understanding of the maritime cultural heritage and to develop capability in the maritime archaeological sector by training in relevant archaeological and underwater skills as well as to develop knowledge and understanding of the technology of the past.<ref>Marc-Andre Bernier, Underwater Archaeology Service, Parks Canada, [http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/index.html \"To Dig or not to Dig\"] in ''Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts'', ICOMOS, 2006.</ref> \n\nIn the past, NAS Training has been supported by [[Cadw]] and [[Historic Scotland]] to provide training opportunities in Wales and Scotland respectively. The development of the NAS training curriculum was supported by [[English Heritage]] and its predecessors from 1991 to 2004.\n\nIn 2015, the NAS Education Programme underwent a major revision to adapt to the increasing use of online learning and to make the qualification system more flexible. As of 2017, the NAS qualification system in the UK consists of the following<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/nas-uk-qualifications|title=NAS UK Qualifications|website=Nautical Archaeology Society|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>:\n\n'''NAS Foundation in Maritime Archaeology'''\n\n''10 or 15 credits''\n\nThis qualification is achieved by completing:\n\n* Two Elearning courses: ''Intro to Maritime Archaeology'' and ''Underwater Archaeology'' or ''Intertidal Archaeology''\n* Underwater ''Recorder'' and ''Surveyor Skills Days'' or Foreshore ''Recorder'' and ''Surveyor Skills Days''\n\n'''NAS Certificate in Maritime Archaeology'''\n\n''100 credits in total''\n\nThis qualification is achieved by completing:\n\n* NAS Foundation, and\n* 85 or 90 credits from ''Maritime Archaeology Courses'', ''Events'' or ''Fieldwork''\n\n'''NAS Award in Maritime Archaeology'''\n\n''300 credits in total''\n\nThis qualification is achieved by completing:\n\n* NAS Certificate (worth 100 credits),and an additional\n* 200 credits from ''Maritime Archaeology Courses'', ''Events'' or ''Fieldwork'', and\n* A 2,000 word archaeological report\n\nNAS members progress through these qualifications by earning credits which are accrued by participating in courses, events and fieldwork. Attending NAS-run activities accrues 5 credits per day while attending non-NAS or self-directed activities earns 2.5 credits per day.\n\n===NAS Training International===\nThe NAS  four-part qualification system<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/pages/Category/international-system|title=International System|website=Nautical Archaeology Society|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> is still used by the numerous International Training Partners that use a locally adapted version of the NAS syllabus to share knowledge and practical skills to local divers and non-divers.

As well as [[shipwrecks]], adopted sites can include [[harbour]] works and buildings with [[nautical]] connections, [[coastal]] habitations, [[Hulk (ship)|hulks]] and other sea wrack of archaeological interest. The society maintains a register of all such adopted sites and since 2003 has provided an annual award to the person or group that has made the most significant contribution to maritime archaeology and research through the adoption process.  A pilot for the Adopt-a-Wreck scheme was run on the East Indiaman ''[[Halsewell (East Indiaman)|Halsewell]]''<ref>[http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/annual_report_2002 Receiver of Wreck Annual Report for 2002], Maritime and Coastguard Agency, p. 13.</ref> \n\nPast winners of the Adopt-a-Wreck award have included:\n* 2003.

In 2008 the administration of the award was transferred to the Nautical Archaeological Society, and the award has been presented bi-annually at the NAS conference since 2009.  It is awarded for the best published work covering maritime, nautical or underwater archaeology which best reflects the pioneering ideas and scholarly standards of Keith Muckelroy.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===The Gresham Ship===\nIn 2004 the Nautical Archaeological Society took custody of the remains of an Elizabethan wreck discovered in the Princes Channel of the [[Thames]] Estuary during dredging operations by the [[Port of London Authority]].<ref>Antony Firth, Wessex Archaeology, [http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/index.html \"Old Shipwrecks and New Dredging: An Elizabethan Ship in the Thames\"] in ''Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts'', ICOMOS, 2006.</ref>  The remains represented a navigation hazard, and as they had been disturbed and damaged by the dredging operations, preservation in situ was not an option.  The remains were investigated by Wessex Archaeology<ref>[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/thameswreck/index.html Wessex Archaeology's investigation of the wreck in Thames]</ref> and [[dendrochronology]] by Nigel Nayling of the University of Wales gave a construction date of soon after 1754, probably in [[East Anglia]].  The remains were transferred to [[Horsea Island]], an estuarine lake near [[Portsmouth]], where the brackish water should enable the timbers to stabilise while they are accessible to students for study and training purposes. The remains of the ship are being studied as part of a five-year project also involving the Port of London Authority, the [[Museum of London Docklands|Museum at Docklands]], the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology at University College London]], [[Gresham College]] and the [[University of Southern Denmark]].  The ship has been termed the \"[[Gresham Ship]]\" because one of the guns recovered had the initials and emblem of Sir Thomas Gresham.<ref>[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&EventId=897 Gresham College lecture on Elizabethan ships]</ref><ref>[http://www.thamesodyssey.org/index.html Thames Odyssey project site for Gresham Ship]</ref><ref>[http://www.pla.co.uk/display_fixedpage.cfm/id/2678/site/environment Port of London website for Gresham Ship]</ref><ref>[http://maritimearchaeologyprogramdenmark.wordpress.com/tag/gresham-ship/ University of South Denmark Research on the Gresham Ship.]</ref>\n\n===Wreckmap Projects===\nThe Nautical Archaeology Society manages or participates in research projects with the aims of firstly furthering research and secondly enabling novice professionals and avocational archaeologists to have opportunities to get involved in archaeological research<ref>[http://www.3HConsulting.com/ 3H Consulting website, the home of Site Recorder]: Examples of surveyed sites, guidance on 3D survey and free Site Reader tool</ref> and hence develop individual experience and promote best practice in investigative techniques. Wreckmap projects focus on surveying and recording sites in a specific area.

The Council membership included the [[Council for British Archaeology]], the [[British Museum]], the [[National Maritime Museum]], the Institute of Archaeology at London University, the [[Society for Nautical Research]] and the Society for Post Medieval Archaeology.  The [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] was also represented on the council.<ref name=\"IJNA 5 2\" />\n\nIt was the CNA that was responsible for establishing the ''International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'' and the Nautical Archaeology Trust in 1972, but it was also concerned with the promotion of legislation for the protection of nautical archaeological sites<ref name=\"IJNA 5 2\" /> playing a key part in what became the [[Protection of Wrecks Act 1973]].\n\nIn 1984 the CNA was incorporated into the Council for British Archaeology as one of its research sub-committees<ref name=\"IJNA 15 3\">{{cite journal | title = The Council for Nautical Archaeology | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = inside front cover | date = August 1986 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.1986.tb00574.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A brief history of the CBA | work=Council for British Archaeology website | publisher=Council for British Archaeology | url = http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cba/history.html | accessdate = 2007-02-08}}</ref>\n\n===The Nautical Archaeology Trust===\nThe body that eventually became the Nautical Archaeology Society was originally incorporated and registered as a charity in 1972 under the name (The) '''Nautical Archaeological Trust''' Limited.<ref name=\"charitycomm\" /><ref name=\"cohouse\" />\n\nThe Trust was established by the Council for Nautical Archaeology as its limited liability charitable arm. As a corporate body the Trust gained the legal ability to enter into contracts and to hold assets.  The Trust's objects were\n:\"''the furtherance of research into nautical archaeology and the publication of the results of such research together with the advancement of training and education in the techniques pertaining to the study of nautical archaeology for the benefit of the public''\"<ref name=\"IJNA 5 2 Trsut\">{{cite journal | title = The Nautical Archaeology Trust | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = inside front cover | date = May 1976 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445}}</ref>\n\nThe Trust organised lectures, conferences and seminars, produced a newsletter and had a mechanism for associate membership for groups, associate individual members and subscribers.  Associate membership provided a discounted purchase price for the ''International Journal of Nautical Archaeology''.\n\nIn 1974, the then chairman of the CNA and of NAT, Professor [[W. F. Grimes]], proposed that what was needed was a membership society<ref name=\"IJNA 10 4 NAS\">{{cite journal | last = Flinder | first = Alex |author2=Margaret Rule | title = The Nautical Archaeology Society | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 273 | date = November 1981 | publisher=Academic Press|location=London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00040.x}}</ref> but this took some years to establish. The CNA and the Trust eventually agreed the form of constitution of such a Society and the inaugural meeting took place in 1981. The intention of the Society was to act as a forum for the interchange of ideas and all of the associates and subscribers of the Trust were transferred to full membership the Society. The specific intention was to further cooperation between amateurs and professionals and its impact spread beyond the UK with a third of the new membership in its first year being from outside the UK.<ref name=\"IJNA 10 4 Editorial\">{{cite journal | last = Morrison | first = Ian | title = Editorial | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 271\u20132 | date = November 1981 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00039.x}}</ref>  [[Joan du Plat Taylor]] was the first president.\n\nFor a few years from 1981, the activities of the charity (the Trust) were separated from the interchange between the members (the Society) although both had identical aims, but the situation was resolved by a special meeting of the Trust held on 3 July 1986 at the Science Museum.<ref name=\"IJNA 15 3 Editorial\">{{cite journal | last = Fenwick | first = Valerie | title = Editorial | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 177 | date = August 1986 | publisher=Academic Press|location=London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1986.tb00572.x}}</ref> At this meeting, the members of the Trust voted to change the name of the Trust to the Nautical Archaeology Society and to change the constitution (the articles of association) to reflect the change to a membership organisation.<ref name=\"cohouse\" />  The reconstituted organisation continued to have responsibility for producing the IJNA and a clause safeguarding the academic standards of the journal was added to the articles.  The renamed Trust thus subsumed the role of providing a forum for the interchange of ideas and the memberships of those who had participated in the Society (many of whom were in any case the original associates and subscribers of the Trust) transferred to membership of the incorporated body.\n\n===The beginning of NAS training===\nWith the dual advantages of a participatory membership and its status as a registered charity, in 1986 the newly reconstituted Nautical Archaeology Society ran the first events in what later became its four-part internationally accredited training syllabus.\n\n==NAS training and education==\n\n===NAS training in the UK===\nThe society educates and trains professional and avocational [[archaeologist]]s and [[Professional diving|commercial]] and [[Recreational diving|recreational divers]].<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1283 English Heritage Protected wrecks website] \u2013 recommendation to use NAS training.</ref> The aim of the NAS training syllabus is to develop awareness, respect for and understanding of the maritime cultural heritage and to develop capability in the maritime archaeological sector by training in relevant archaeological and underwater skills as well as to develop knowledge and understanding of the technology of the past.<ref>Marc-Andre Bernier, Underwater Archaeology Service, Parks Canada, [http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/index.html \"To Dig or not to Dig\"] in ''Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts'', ICOMOS, 2006.</ref> \n\nIn the past, NAS Training has been supported by [[Cadw]] and [[Historic Scotland]] to provide training opportunities in Wales and Scotland respectively. The development of the NAS training curriculum was supported by [[English Heritage]] and its predecessors from 1991 to 2004.\n\nIn 2015, the NAS Education Programme underwent a major revision to adapt to the increasing use of online learning and to make the qualification system more flexible. As of 2017, the NAS qualification system in the UK consists of the following<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/nas-uk-qualifications|title=NAS UK Qualifications|website=Nautical Archaeology Society|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>:\n\n'''NAS Foundation in Maritime Archaeology'''\n\n''10 or 15 credits''\n\nThis qualification is achieved by completing:\n\n* Two Elearning courses: ''Intro to Maritime Archaeology'' and ''Underwater Archaeology'' or ''Intertidal Archaeology''\n* Underwater ''Recorder'' and ''Surveyor Skills Days'' or Foreshore ''Recorder'' and ''Surveyor Skills Days''\n\n'''NAS Certificate in Maritime Archaeology'''\n\n''100 credits in total''\n\nThis qualification is achieved by completing:\n\n* NAS Foundation, and\n* 85 or 90 credits from ''Maritime Archaeology Courses'', ''Events'' or ''Fieldwork''\n\n'''NAS Award in Maritime Archaeology'''\n\n''300 credits in total''\n\nThis qualification is achieved by completing:\n\n* NAS Certificate (worth 100 credits),and an additional\n* 200 credits from ''Maritime Archaeology Courses'', ''Events'' or ''Fieldwork'', and\n* A 2,000 word archaeological report\n\nNAS members progress through these qualifications by earning credits which are accrued by participating in courses, events and fieldwork.

As well as [[shipwrecks]], adopted sites can include [[harbour]] works and buildings with [[nautical]] connections, [[coastal]] habitations, [[Hulk (ship)|hulks]] and other sea wrack of archaeological interest. The society maintains a register of all such adopted sites and since 2003 has provided an annual award to the person or group that has made the most significant contribution to maritime archaeology and research through the adoption process.  A pilot for the Adopt-a-Wreck scheme was run on the East Indiaman ''[[Halsewell (East Indiaman)|Halsewell]]''<ref>[http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/annual_report_2002 Receiver of Wreck Annual Report for 2002], Maritime and Coastguard Agency, p. 13.</ref> \n\nPast winners of the Adopt-a-Wreck award have included:\n* 2003.

It is awarded for the best published work covering maritime, nautical or underwater archaeology which best reflects the pioneering ideas and scholarly standards of Keith Muckelroy.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===The Gresham Ship===\nIn 2004 the Nautical Archaeological Society took custody of the remains of an Elizabethan wreck discovered in the Princes Channel of the [[Thames]] Estuary during dredging operations by the [[Port of London Authority]].<ref>Antony Firth, Wessex Archaeology, [http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/index.html \"Old Shipwrecks and New Dredging: An Elizabethan Ship in the Thames\"] in ''Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts'', ICOMOS, 2006.</ref>  The remains represented a navigation hazard, and as they had been disturbed and damaged by the dredging operations, preservation in situ was not an option.  The remains were investigated by Wessex Archaeology<ref>[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/thameswreck/index.html Wessex Archaeology's investigation of the wreck in Thames]</ref> and [[dendrochronology]] by Nigel Nayling of the University of Wales gave a construction date of soon after 1754, probably in [[East Anglia]].  The remains were transferred to [[Horsea Island]], an estuarine lake near [[Portsmouth]], where the brackish water should enable the timbers to stabilise while they are accessible to students for study and training purposes. The remains of the ship are being studied as part of a five-year project also involving the Port of London Authority, the [[Museum of London Docklands|Museum at Docklands]], the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology at University College London]], [[Gresham College]] and the [[University of Southern Denmark]].  The ship has been termed the \"[[Gresham Ship]]\" because one of the guns recovered had the initials and emblem of Sir Thomas Gresham.<ref>[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&EventId=897 Gresham College lecture on Elizabethan ships]</ref><ref>[http://www.thamesodyssey.org/index.html Thames Odyssey project site for Gresham Ship]</ref><ref>[http://www.pla.co.uk/display_fixedpage.cfm/id/2678/site/environment Port of London website for Gresham Ship]</ref><ref>[http://maritimearchaeologyprogramdenmark.wordpress.com/tag/gresham-ship/ University of South Denmark Research on the Gresham Ship.]</ref>\n\n===Wreckmap Projects===\nThe Nautical Archaeology Society manages or participates in research projects with the aims of firstly furthering research and secondly enabling novice professionals and avocational archaeologists to have opportunities to get involved in archaeological research<ref>[http://www.3HConsulting.com/ 3H Consulting website, the home of Site Recorder]: Examples of surveyed sites, guidance on 3D survey and free Site Reader tool</ref> and hence develop individual experience and promote best practice in investigative techniques.
