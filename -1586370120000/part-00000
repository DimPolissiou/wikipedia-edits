These processes make up the route through which cell surface proteins are trafficked from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and are recycled.  Surface protein recycling returns proteins to the surface whose function involves carrying another protein or substance inside the cell, such as the transferrin receptor, or serves as a means of regulating the number of a certain type of protein molecules on the surface.\n\n== Function ==\n[[File:RAB protein vesicle transport.jpg|thumb|500x500px|The 4 Steps of Vesicle Transport]]\nRab proteins are peripheral membrane proteins, anchored to a membrane via a lipid group covalently linked to an amino acid.  Specifically, Rabs are anchored via [[prenyl]] groups on two [[cysteine]]s in the C-terminus.  Rab escort proteins (REPs) deliver newly synthesized and prenylated Rab to its destination membrane by binding the [[hydrophobic]], insoluble prenyl groups and carrying Rab through the cytoplasm.  The [[lipid]] [[prenyl group]]s can then insert into the membrane, anchoring Rab at the cytoplasmic face of a vesicle or the plasma membrane. Because Rab proteins are anchored to the membrane through a flexible C-terminal region, they can be thought of as a 'balloon on a string'.\n\nUnlike other GTPases, Rabs switch between two conformations, an active form bound to GDP (guanosine diphosphate), and an inactive form bound to GTP (guanosine triphosphate). A GTP/GDP exchange factor (GEF) catalyzes the conversion from GTP-bound to GDP-bound form, thereby activating the Rab.  The inherent GTP hydrolysis of Rabs can be enhanced by a [[GTPase-activating protein|GTPase-activating protein (GAP)]] leading to Rab inactivation.  REPs carry only the GDP-bound form of Rab, and Rab effectors, proteins with which Rab interacts and through which it functions, only bind the GTP-bound form of Rab.  Rab effectors are very heterogeneous, and each Rab isoform has many effectors through which it carries out multiple functions. The specific binding of the effector to the Rab protein allows the Rab protein to be effective, and conversely, the conformation shift of the Rab protein to the inactive state leads to effector dissociation from the Rab protein.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Seabra MC, Mules EH, Hume AN | title = Rab GTPases, intracellular traffic and disease | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 23\u201330 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11796263 | doi = 10.1016/s1471-4914(01)02227-4 }}</ref>\n\nEffector proteins have one of four different functions. \n# Cargo budding, selection, and coating\n# Vesicle Transport\n# Vesicle Uncoating and Tethering\n# Vesicle Fusion<ref name=\":1\" />\nAfter membrane fusion and effector dissociation, Rab is recycled back to its membrane of origin.

[[Island biogeography]] can help explain island species and associated unfilled niches.\n\n==Grinnellian niche==\n[[File:P1180957 Arles rue du Quatre-Septembre n14 rwk.jpg|thumb|upright|A niche: the place where a statue may stand]]\n\nThe ecological meaning of niche comes from the meaning of niche as a recess in a wall for a statue,<ref name=\"oxford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/126748|title=Niche|work=Oxford English Dictionary {{Subscription required}}|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> which itself is probably derived from the [[Middle French]] word ''nicher'', meaning ''to nest''.<ref name=\"webster\"/><ref name=\"oxford\"/> \nThe term was coined by the naturalist [[Roswell Hill Johnson]]<ref name=Johnson1910>\n{{cite book |last= Johnson |first= Roswell |date= 1910 |title= Determinate evolution in the color-pattern of the lady-beetles |url= |location= Washington |publisher= Carnegie Institution of Washington|page= |isbn= |access-date= |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.30902 }}</ref>\nbut [[Joseph Grinnell]] was probably the first to use it in a research program in 1917, in his paper \"The niche relationships of the California Thrasher\".<ref name=Grinnell1917>{{cite journal |author = Joseph Grinnell |year = 1917 |title = The niche-relationships of the California Thrasher |journal = The Auk |volume = 34 |issue = 4 |pages = 427\u2013433 |url = http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Grinnell1917.pdf |doi = 10.2307/4072271 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310144027/http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Grinnell1917.pdf |archivedate = 2016-03-10 |jstor = 4072271 }}</ref><ref name=Pocheville2015 />\n\nThe Grinnellian niche concept embodies the idea that the niche of a species is determined by the [[habitat]] in which it lives and its accompanying [[Behavioral ecology|behavioral adaptations]]. In other words, the niche is the sum of the habitat requirements and behaviors that allow a species to persist and produce offspring. For example, the behavior of the [[California thrasher]] is consistent with the [[chaparral]] habitat it lives in\u2014it breeds and feeds in the underbrush and escapes from its predators by shuffling from underbrush to underbrush. Its 'niche' is defined by the felicitous complementing of the thrasher's behavior and physical traits (camouflaging color, short wings, strong legs) with this habitat.<ref name=Grinnell1917/>\n\nThis perspective of niche allows for the existence of both ecological equivalents and empty niches. An ecological equivalent to an organism is an organism from a different taxonomic group exhibiting similar adaptations in a similar habitat, an example being the different [[Succulent plant|succulents]] found in American and African deserts, [[cactus]] and [[euphorbia]], respectively.<ref name=Huggett>\n{{cite book |author=Richard J.

In an oak wood this niche is filled by [[tawny owl]]s, while in the open grassland it is occupied by [[kestrel]]s. The existence of this carnivore niche is dependent on the further fact that mice form a definite herbivore niche in many different associations, although the actual species of mice may be quite different.<ref name=Elton2001/>}}\n\nConceptually, the Eltonian niche introduces the idea of a species' ''response'' ''to'' and ''effect on'' the environment.

In other words, the niche is the sum of the habitat requirements and behaviors that allow a species to persist and produce offspring. For example, the behavior of the [[California thrasher]] is consistent with the [[chaparral]] habitat it lives in\u2014it breeds and feeds in the underbrush and escapes from its predators by shuffling from underbrush to underbrush. Its 'niche' is defined by the felicitous complementing of the thrasher's behavior and physical traits (camouflaging color, short wings, strong legs) with this habitat.<ref name=Grinnell1917/>\n\nThis perspective of niche allows for the existence of both ecological equivalents and empty niches.

Thus, the beaver affects the biotic and abiotic conditions of other species that live in and near the watershed.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Beaver as Engineers: Influences on Biotic and Abiotic Characteristics of Drainage Basins |publisher = Springer |year= 1995 |isbn = 978-1-4613-5714-8 |pages = 117\u2013126 |doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-1773-3_12 |first = Michael M. |last = Pollock |first2 = Robert J. |last2 = Naiman |first3 = Heather E. |last3 = Erickson|first4 = Carol A.|last4 = Johnston|first5 = John|last5 = Pastor|first6 = Gilles|last6 = Pinay|editor-first = Clive G.|editor-last = Jones|editor-first2 = John H.|editor-last2 = Lawton}}</ref> In a more subtle case, competitors that consume resources at different rates can lead to cycles in resource density that differ between species.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Competitive Exclusion |jstor= 2460592 |journal = The American Naturalist|date = February 1980 |pages = 151\u2013170 |volume = 115|issue = 2 |first = Robert A. |last = Armstrong |first2 = Richard |last2 = McGehee |doi=10.1086/283553}}</ref> Not only do species grow differently with respect to resource density, but their own population growth can [[relative nonlinearity|affect resource density over time]].\n\n==Hutchinsonian niche==<!-- Hutchinsonian niche redirects here-->\n[[File:Purple-throated carib hummingbird feeding.jpg|thumb|The shape of the [[beak|bill]] of this [[purple-throated carib]] is complementary to the shape of the flower and [[coevolution|coevolved]] with it, enabling it to exploit the nectar as a resource.]]\n\nThe Hutchinsonian niche is an \"[[N-dimensional space|n-dimensional]] hypervolume\", where the dimensions are environmental conditions and [[Resource (biology)|resources]], that define the requirements of an individual or a species to practice \"its\" way of life, more particularly, for its population to persist.<ref name=Levin/> The \"hypervolume\" defines the multi-dimensional space of resources (e.g., light, nutrients, structure, etc.) available to (and specifically used by) organisms, and \"all species other than those under consideration are regarded as part of the coordinate system.\"<ref name=Hutchinson1957>{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson, G.E. | year = 1957 | title = Concluding remarks | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 415\u2013427 | url = http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Hutchinson1957.pdf | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | doi = 10.1101/sqb.1957.022.01.039 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926153803/http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Hutchinson1957.pdf | archive-date = 2007-09-26 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe niche concept was popularized by the zoologist [[G.

In 1962 (when he began his first TV program), [[Silvio Santos]] produced his own programs on Tupi, TV Paulista and on [[Rede Globo]] beginning in 1965. Soon enough, he started plans to have his own television channel. His production company, Estudios Silvio Santos Cinema e Televisao, was successful on Tupi, Globo and (since 1972) on [[RecordTV]] (where he then owned half of the company's stock).\n\nIn 1976, with help from humorist and friend Manoel de N\u00f3brega (who had a show on Rede Globo and was part of ''Bau de Felicidade''), Santos obtained a license for his own station: [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s channel 11, known as \"TV Studios\" or \"TVS\". Soon after its launch, its flagship program (''Programa Silvio Santos'' on Sundays) plus the late night ''Silvio Santos Diferente'' on weekdays began to be broadcast (Santos left Globo the same year). Other programs soon began, as the network gained support from city residents who sought an alternative to Globo, Tupi, Bandeirantes and [[TV Rio]] (the city's network, related to TV Record along with TVS). The new channel debuted on May 14, 1976, with a logo of a gold circle with the number 11 slanted in gold, which featured in the first [[Scanimate]] idents and promos for the channel - making it a pioneer station in the country when it came to computer animation. While during its early years the network studios were based in Rio, all program production for TVS transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo in 1978-79.\n[[File:TV SBT RJ headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|caption|250px|Headquarters of SBT in [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]\n\nWhen [[Rede Tupi]] went out of business in 1980, Santos obtained three stations from the network: [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]'s channel 4, [[Porto Alegre]]'s channel 5 and [[Bel\u00e9m]]'s channel 5. SBT was created, launching on August 19, 1981 but using the TVS name until 1990 for some of its stations. Until the formation of SBT, the Silvio Santos Group also had a station named TVS in [[Nova Friburgo]], serving viewers in the northern and western parts of the state, this was also its first branch station, having opened in 1979.\n\nIn 1978, [[Minas Gerais]]'s [[TV Alterosa]] became one of SBT's broadcast-affiliate networks, the first affiliate station for the channel. Some later affiliates were adopted from Rede Tupi after its closure on July 18, 1980 by order of Brazilian Minister of Communications Haroldo de Matos, who the following year would order SBT to begin transmissions. When Tupi closed, ''Programa Silvio Santos'' moved to Record but continued simulcasting Sundays on TVS Channels 11 and 3, as well as on yet another SS Group station - Channel 9, purchased from TV Continental.  Santos began the network's expansion efforts, convincing stations to become SBT and Record affiliates. The official launch of the network on August 19, 1981 also marked the debut of its first presentation package using its famous circle logo (similar to the one used till today by the [[American Broadcasting Company]]) and dual branding (SBT being the official name of the network while TVS being the station branding in its 3 founding stations), and it was the only network launch to be held in [[Brasilia]] and broadcast directly from the federal capital city. The first idents were similar to ABC's ''Still the One'' idents of 1979, used by the [[Nine Network]] in Australia in 1980.\n\nThe Matos decision also gave the network the Sumare studios of Tupi for drama production. By the time of the 1981 launch SBT had 18 affiliate channels nationwide.\n\n===1980s===\nDuring the 1980s SBT established itself, contracting popular hosts and airing a mix of its own and [[Televisa]] programming (especially Mexican ''[[telenovelas]]'' and comedy shows such as ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'' and ''[[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]]''). It climbed to second place in the Brazilian ratings (except in Rio de Janeiro, where [[Rede Manchete]] occupied that position). Moreover, it hosted the Brazilian version of ''Bozo'' for kids plus even let ex-Tupi program presenters bring their shows over to the fledgling network.\n\n1985 would see SBT score a historic victory with the broadcast of the Australian miniseries ''The Thorn Birds'', and TVS Channel 4 S\u00e3o Paulo became SBT Channel 4 S\u00e3o Paulo thus becoming a truly national network with the introduction of satellite broadcasts.\n\nIn March 1986, the network premiered its new talk show, ''Hebe'', with Hebe Camargo as host; the show was formerly on [[Rede Tupi]] and [[Rede Bandeirantes]]. It became one of the network's longest-running programs, running for over 24 years; the final show was at the end of 2010, when Camargo ended her contract. She had a spin-off show, ''Hebe por Elas'' (''Hebe for All''), during the early 1990s. The death of Flavio Cavacante, one of the network's pioneer presenters, just days after his May 22 episode of his own program shocked the nation so much that on the day of his funeral the network started transmissions only in the afternoon in his honor.\n\nIn 1987, Santos pursued a better-quality program lineup, while trying to attract a larger audience and better advertisers. During that year (in response to the high popularity of Rede Globo's ''Xou da Xuxa'' on weekdays), SBT began increasing its child-oriented programming with programs such as ''Oradukapeta'', ''Show Maravilha'' and the ''Do Re Mi'' series. Nearly all SBT kids' programs had female presenters (different from the format of ''Xou da Xuxa''), because ''Oradukapeta'' was hosted by Sergio Mallandro (also a ''Show de Calorous'' judge).\n\nThe network also launched its slogan \"''Quem procura, acha aqui''\", modeled on NBC's three-year \"Be There\" campaign project from 1983\u20131985. The slogan lasted for three seasons, with a new promo each year. The theme used each year corresponded to NBC's theme for its project:\n\n* 1983\u20131987: NBC's \"Be There\", with SBT's first installment of \"Quem Procura Acha Aqui\"\n* 1984\u20131988: NBC's first installment of \"Let's All Be There\", with SBT's second \"Quem Procura Acha Aqui\"\n* 1985\u20131989: NBC's second installment of \"Let's All Be There\", with SBT's third and final \"Quem Procura Acha Aqui\"\n\nEven all program adverts were also modeled on the NBC ones, with the 1989-90 edition seeing the program talents saying the day the program will be aired followed by the phrase ''No SBT'' (On SBT) with the program time being shown, this style was carried on to 1990.\n\n1987 also was the year that the network began to change its corporate branding from TVS to SBT, and the 2nd year of its \"QPAA\" campaign resulted in the logo being relaunched, now with slanted colors on the circle (similar to ABC's 1987-88 logo and its \"Something's Happening on ABC\" campaign).\n\nHumorist J\u00f4 Soares was brought in from TV Globo in 1988, introducing a late-night talk program to Brazilian TV with his 11:30-pm show entitled ''J\u00f4 Soares Onze e Meia''. Also signed was [[Boris Casoy]], who became the first [[Anchorman#News anchors|news anchor]] in Brazil with his ''[[TJ Brasil]]'' newscast (which succeeded ''Noticentro'', the network's first newscast with Antonio Casale) and ex-Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico member Simony.\n\nIn 1988, Santos prevented host \"Gugu\" Liberato from signing with Globo after Liberato hosted SBT's big weekend hit ''Viva a Noite'' since 1986. This was widely seen as indicative that Gugu would be Santos' successor on Sunday afternoons, reinforced by the extended timeslot of Gugu's future program ''Domingo Legal''. As a result, ''Programa S\u00edlvio Santos'' adopted the dual-presenter format, with Gugu hosting segments such as the Brazilian version of [[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]], called ''Passa ou Repassa'' (known for its \"[[pieing|Torta na Cara]]\" segment) and ''Cidade contra Cidade''. SBT broadcast the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], two years after its [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] coverage.\n\n===1990s===\nThe TVS brand was merged into the SBT brand in 1990; the name change was seen in a new campaign ad modeled on NBC's ''\"Come Home to NBC\"'' campaign of 1986-87, which premiered early that year, and in August on TV station identifications celebrating SBT's ninth year of broadcasts (that year, Silvio Santos sold Record as a national network) and it also broadcast the 1990 FIFA World Cup. 1991 saw the beginning of its newscast ''Aqui Agora'' and Serginho Groisman's ''Programa Livre'' variety show, just a few of the many successes for the year even as the network's S\u00e3o Paulo studios suffered damages due to massive floods that hit the city. In 1992 SBT and Rede Globo jointly broadcast the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] nationwide, with a grand advertising campaign for the Brazilian national team. Despite problems and even the transfer of talents to other stations (such as the then resurgent [[Rede Record]]), the 90s proved to be a boom for the network.\n\nSBT invested in its own ''[[telenovelas]]'' and remakes of successful ones from foreign networks (most notably [[Chiquititas (1997 Brazilian TV series)|Chiquititas]]), variety programs, news and current affairs, and broadcast rights for sporting events (including the [[Copa Mercosur]], Copa do Brasil and [[Champ Car]]). It signed host Carlos \"Ratinho\" Massa in 1998, obtained more Mexican productions and launched [[game shows]] (such as ''[[Show do Milh\u00e3o]]'') in 1999. By the end of the decade SBT held second place in the Brazilian ratings, after Globo, strengthed by a brand new and technologically advanced television complex, the CDT da Anhanguera, inaugurated in 1996, just in time for its 15th anniversary.\n\n====Ad campaigns====\n{{anchor|American and Australian imports}}\n;American and Australian imports\nThe 1990s were SBT's most fruitful decade for American-style ad campaigns:\n* 1987\u20131990: NBC's second installment of \"Come Home to NBC\",  with ''\"Vem Que \u00e9 Bom\"'' with the graphics of 1988's \"Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC\"\n* 1986\u20131991: NBC's first year of \"Come Home\", with ''\"10 anos com voc\u00ea\"'' (the 10th-anniversary slogan)\n* 1990\u20131991 and 1993\u201394: [[CBS]]'s second year of \"Get Ready for CBS\" with ''\"Se liga no SBT\"''. On January 20, 1991, the Australian Network Ten launched \"That's Entertainment\" to coincide with a logo change, using in-house music and similar graphics\n* 1989\u20131992 and 1995: ABC's first year of \"America's Watching [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\" became ''\"Fique ligado no SBT\"''. In 1992 Ten launched \"This Is It\" with its promo based on the music from \"America's Watching\", in a different key with different instrumentation and vocals.\n{{anchor|In-house productions}}\n;Domestic campaigns\n* In 1992, the one-minute spot ''\"Aqui Tem\"'' was launched for network-wide use. The promo featured an in-house soundtrack (with similarities to NBC's \"Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC\" campaign of 1988-89) and graphic elements from NBC's 1991 campaign, \"The Place to Be\".\n* In August 1996 SBT launched a new logo (replacing its multicoloured stripes with solid colours) and relaunched \"QPAA\" with a new slogan, ''\"Tudo Pra Voc\u00ea\"'', for its 15th anniversary.\n* In 1997, SBT made its new graphics based on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s 1996 campaign, Watched by More People.\n* In 1998 the network released ''\"A cara do Brasil\"'', with new graphics and soundtrack.\n* In 1999 the network produced ''\"Na nossa frente, so voc\u00ea\"'', with new graphics and music. The 64-second promo was used on-air for the first time in 2000; the slogan was used until 2004 with two songs composed for this. The 1st campaign spot (1999-2000) mirrored the [[Nine Network]]'s 1997 promo spots but with an original soundtrack.\n\n===2000s===\nSBT began the decade investing in movies, broadcasting a package of [[Disney]] (now affiliated with Rede Globo) and [[Time Warner]] productions (the latter promoted in a one-hour network block). In 2001, the controversial [[reality show]] ''Casa dos Artistas'', accused by many of being a copy of [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', marked the first time SBT led the Sunday-night ratings, aside from its ''Domingo Legal'' program becoming no.1 in the Sunday afternoon ratings.\n\nSince 2003, with the ratings advances of [[RecordTV]] and [[Rede Bandeirantes]], SBT's ratings have declined. Two events that year marked the beginning of its problems:\n* Early in the year Silvio Santos gave an interview with the TV-gossip magazine ''Contigo!'', in which he stated that he was ill and had sold SBT. Later, he claimed that this was intended as a joke.\n* The \"Gugu-PCC scandal\": On September 7 ''Domingo Legal'' aired an interview with alleged members of the criminal group PCC, threatening the deputy mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo and the hosts of police reality programs on the compteting TV Record and Rede TV! networks. Later, it was discovered that this was a hoax; the program was suspended for a week, its audience never recovered and Gugu Liberato (its host, once seen as Santos' successor) never regained his credibility.\n\nSince then SBT has aired the successful ''[[Rebelde (Brazilian telenovela)|Rebelde]]'' and shows with child host [[Maisa Silva]], who became popular; however, programs could change without previous announcement (even hosts were sometimes out of the loop), confusing the audience. In 2006, SBT celebrated its 25th anniversary in a deepening crisis.\n\nSBT is the second-largest network in the country, vying for leadership with [[Rede Record]]. The [[CDT da Anhanguera]] is the second-largest television-production center in Brazil, behind [[Projac]] (owned by [[Rede Globo]]). Over 5,000 employees work around the clock at SBT's 110 TV stations.\nIn 2008 the network lost second place in the ratings to Record, but tied for second place the following year.\nIn 2009, Liberato moved to Record after more than 20 years with SBT; at the same time, SBT signed presenters Roberto Justus and Eliana from Record. It also appeared on [[SKY Brasil]], the last of the five major Brazilian networks to do so.\n\nRecent programs include ''What's Your Talent'', a local combination of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' and ''[[Show de Calouros]]'' (created and hosted by [[Silvio Santos]] during the 1970s); a Brazilian version of ''[[1 vs. 100]]''; an annual telethon, which raised R$19 million in 2009; ''[[Kyle XY]]''; the reality show ''[[Solitary (TV series)|Solitary]]''; ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and ''De Frente with Gabi'', a talk show featuring journalist Marilia Gabriela.\n\nTV Alagoas left the network in September 2009 and to broadcast religious programs, and SBT executive director William Stoliar sued to ensure the network's availability [[Alagoas|there]]. It returned to SBT on June 1, 2010, due to viewer pressure and late rent payments by religious programs.\n\nIn February 2014, the [[Communist Party of Brazil]] sends to the Federal Government a questioning, for which he cut around 75 million dollars in advertising the broadcaster, because of criticism that the journalist Rachel Sheherazade makes against the

In 1998 it ran the longest children's programming block in Brazilian TV history with [[TV Cultura]], from ''Sess\u00e3o Desenho'' (a cartoon block) at 7:00 am (after the morning newscast) until 9:00 pm (when the children's [[telenovela]] ''[[Chiquititas]]'' ended). SBT promoted the 14-hour block as \"SBT Kids\".\n\nWhile most TV stations in Brazil depend on domestic productions, SBT relies on imports (mainly from Mexico and the U.S.). Since 1984, ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'' (shown in Brazil as ''Chaves'') is one of the station's most popular programs. The network had until 2014 an agreement with Warner Brothers, giving it an exclusivity deal for its sitcoms, dramas and films.\n\nMexican ''telenovelas'' have been a staple on SBT, reaching their peak during the early 1990s with the child-oriented ''[[Carrusel]]'', ''[[La usurpadora (1998 TV series)|La usurpadora]]'', ''[[El Privilegio de Amar]]'' and ''[[Luz Clarita]]'' and the popular \"Mar\u00eda trilogy\" (''[[Mar\u00eda Mercedes (telenovela)|Mar\u00eda Mercedes]]'', ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' and ''[[Mar\u00eda la del Barrio]]''). Compared to subdued Brazilian telenovelas, Mexican soaps are considered tacky and exaggerated.\n\nOther 1990s hits included ''[[Domingo Legal]]'' (''Cool Sunday'') (a Sunday variety show which was SBT's highest-rated program, surpassing ''TV Globo''), and the network was the most popular channel in Brazil for hours at a stretch. ''Domingo Legal'' was criticized for its sensationalism, and its ratings began to fall after the ''[[Primeiro Comando da Capital]]'' (PCC) scandal (see [[#2000s|below]]); the show often ranks second in the ratings. Other popular programs included ''[[Programa do Ratinho]]'' (''Ratinho's Show'', with a similar format to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''), ''[[Show do Milh\u00e3o]]'' (''The Million Show'', similar to ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]]''), ''[[Topa Tudo por Dinheiro]]'' (''Variety show large audience that was aired on Sunday night between 1991 to 2001''), [[Fantasia (Brazilian television program)|''Fantasia'']] (Entertainment program where people could play games by phoning the program in order to earn money), and the Brazilian version of the Argentinean soap opera''[[Chiquititas]]'', popular with children.\n\nFor over 20 years SBT held second place in the Brazilian television ratings (behind [[Rede Globo]]), but in February 2007 it was outpaced by [[Rede Record]] for the first time in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. However, after a period of resurgence which started in 2011, SBT successfully overtook Record for second place in June 2014.\n\nSince their 1990s peak in popularity, Mexican ''telenovelas'' have been steadily declining in the ratings; the last popular Mexican soap operas were ''[[Carita de \u00c1ngel]]'' in the early 2000s and ''[[Rebelde (Mexican telenovela)|Rebelde]]'' in 2006. In 2001, SBT began remaking Mexican soaps with Brazilian actors. The first soaps (''Picara Sonhadora'' and ''[[Marisol (Braziilan TV series)|Marisol]]'') did fairly well in the ratings; however, later soaps (''[[Cristal (telenovela)|Cristal]]'', ''Os Ricos Tamb\u00e9m Choram'' and ''Maria Esperan\u00e7a'', a version of the popular ''Maria Mercedes'') were less popular.\n\nIn addition to Mexican soaps and their remakes, the channel also airs cartoons mornings and programs such as ''\u00cddolos'' (a Brazilian version of ''[[American Idol]]'' which later moved to TV Record), a Brazilian version of ''[[Supernanny]]'',  a version of ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' (presented by Silvio Santos, who also presents many network programs), talent shows and a dating show. The network also airs movies and ''[[A Pra\u00e7a \u00e9 Nossa]]'' (a long-running, popular comedy program).\n\n=={{anchor|TV stations}}Stations==\nThroughout Brazil SBT has over 110 television stations; 10 are directly-owned, and the rest are affiliates.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

In 1962 (when he began his first TV program), [[Silvio Santos]] produced his own programs on Tupi, TV Paulista and on [[Rede Globo]] beginning in 1965. Soon enough, he started plans to have his own television channel. His production company, Estudios Silvio Santos Cinema e Televisao, was successful on Tupi, Globo and (since 1972) on [[RecordTV]] (where he then owned half of the company's stock).\n\nIn 1976, with help from humorist and friend Manoel de N\u00f3brega (who had a show on Rede Globo and was part of ''Bau de Felicidade''), Santos obtained a license for his own station: [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s channel 11, known as \"TV Studios\" or \"TVS\". Soon after its launch, its flagship program (''Programa Silvio Santos'' on Sundays) plus the late night ''Silvio Santos Diferente'' on weekdays began to be broadcast (Santos left Globo the same year). Other programs soon began, as the network gained support from city residents who sought an alternative to Globo, Tupi, Bandeirantes and [[TV Rio]] (the city's network, related to TV Record along with TVS). The new channel debuted on May 14, 1976, with a logo of a gold circle with the number 11 slanted in gold, which featured in the first [[Scanimate]] idents and promos for the channel - making it a pioneer station in the country when it came to computer animation. While during its early years the network studios were based in Rio, all program production for TVS transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo in 1978-79.\n[[File:TV SBT RJ headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|caption|250px|Headquarters of SBT in [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]\n\nWhen [[Rede Tupi]] went out of business in 1980, Santos obtained three stations from the network: [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]'s channel 4, [[Porto Alegre]]'s channel 5 and [[Bel\u00e9m]]'s channel 5. SBT was created, launching on August 19, 1981 but using the TVS name until 1990 for some of its stations. Until the formation of SBT, the Silvio Santos Group also had a station named TVS in [[Nova Friburgo]], serving viewers in the northern and western parts of the state, this was also its first branch station, having opened in 1979.\n\nIn 1978, [[Minas Gerais]]'s [[TV Alterosa]] became one of SBT's broadcast-affiliate networks, the first affiliate station for the channel. Some later affiliates were adopted from Rede Tupi after its closure on July 18, 1980 by order of Brazilian Minister of Communications Haroldo de Matos, who the following year would order SBT to begin transmissions. When Tupi closed, ''Programa Silvio Santos'' moved to Record but continued simulcasting Sundays on TVS Channels 11 and 3, as well as on yet another SS Group station - Channel 9, purchased from TV Continental.  Santos began the network's expansion efforts, convincing stations to become SBT and Record affiliates. The official launch of the network on August 19, 1981 also marked the debut of its first presentation package using its famous circle logo (similar to the one used till today by the [[American Broadcasting Company]]) and dual branding (SBT being the official name of the network while TVS being the station branding in its 3 founding stations), and it was the only network launch to be held in [[Brasilia]] and broadcast directly from the federal capital city. The first idents were similar to ABC's ''Still the One'' idents of 1979, used by the [[Nine Network]] in Australia in 1980.\n\nThe Matos decision also gave the network the Sumare studios of Tupi for drama production. By the time of the 1981 launch SBT had 18 affiliate channels nationwide.\n\n===1980s===\nDuring the 1980s SBT established itself, contracting popular hosts and airing a mix of its own and [[Televisa]] programming (especially Mexican ''[[telenovelas]]'' and comedy shows such as ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'' and ''[[El Chapul\u00edn Colorado]]''). It climbed to second place in the Brazilian ratings (except in Rio de Janeiro, where [[Rede Manchete]] occupied that position). Moreover, it hosted the Brazilian version of ''Bozo'' for kids plus even let ex-Tupi program presenters bring their shows over to the fledgling network.\n\n1985 would see SBT score a historic victory with the broadcast of the Australian miniseries ''The Thorn Birds'', and TVS Channel 4 S\u00e3o Paulo became SBT Channel 4 S\u00e3o Paulo thus becoming a truly national network with the introduction of satellite broadcasts.\n\nIn March 1986, the network premiered its new talk show, ''Hebe'', with Hebe Camargo as host; the show was formerly on [[Rede Tupi]] and [[Rede Bandeirantes]]. It became one of the network's longest-running programs, running for over 24 years; the final show was at the end of 2010, when Camargo ended her contract. She had a spin-off show, ''Hebe por Elas'' (''Hebe for All''), during the early 1990s. The death of Flavio Cavacante, one of the network's pioneer presenters, just days after his May 22 episode of his own program shocked the nation so much that on the day of his funeral the network started transmissions only in the afternoon in his honor.\n\nIn 1987, Santos pursued a better-quality program lineup, while trying to attract a larger audience and better advertisers. During that year (in response to the high popularity of Rede Globo's ''Xou da Xuxa'' on weekdays), SBT began increasing its child-oriented programming with programs such as ''Oradukapeta'', ''Show Maravilha'' and the ''Do Re Mi'' series. Nearly all SBT kids' programs had female presenters (different from the format of ''Xou da Xuxa''), because ''Oradukapeta'' was hosted by Sergio Mallandro (also a ''Show de Calorous'' judge).\n\nThe network also launched its slogan \"''Quem procura, acha aqui''\", modeled on NBC's three-year \"Be There\" campaign project from 1983\u20131985. The slogan lasted for three seasons, with a new promo each year. The theme used each year corresponded to NBC's theme for its project:\n\n* 1983\u20131987: NBC's \"Be There\", with SBT's first installment of \"Quem Procura Acha Aqui\"\n* 1984\u20131988: NBC's first installment of \"Let's All Be There\", with SBT's second \"Quem Procura Acha Aqui\"\n* 1985\u20131989: NBC's second installment of \"Let's All Be There\", with SBT's third and final \"Quem Procura Acha Aqui\"\n\nEven all program adverts were also modeled on the NBC ones, with the 1989-90 edition seeing the program talents saying the day the program will be aired followed by the phrase ''No SBT'' (On SBT) with the program time being shown, this style was carried on to 1990.\n\n1987 also was the year that the network began to change its corporate branding from TVS to SBT, and the 2nd year of its \"QPAA\" campaign resulted in the logo being relaunched, now with slanted colors on the circle (similar to ABC's 1987-88 logo and its \"Something's Happening on ABC\" campaign).\n\nHumorist J\u00f4 Soares was brought in from TV Globo in 1988, introducing a late-night talk program to Brazilian TV with his 11:30-pm show entitled ''J\u00f4 Soares Onze e Meia''. Also signed was [[Boris Casoy]], who became the first [[Anchorman#News anchors|news anchor]] in Brazil with his ''[[TJ Brasil]]'' newscast (which succeeded ''Noticentro'', the network's first newscast with Antonio Casale) and ex-Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico member Simony.\n\nIn 1988, Santos prevented host \"Gugu\" Liberato from signing with Globo after Liberato hosted SBT's big weekend hit ''Viva a Noite'' since 1986. This was widely seen as indicative that Gugu would be Santos' successor on Sunday afternoons, reinforced by the extended timeslot of Gugu's future program ''Domingo Legal''. As a result, ''Programa S\u00edlvio Santos'' adopted the dual-presenter format, with Gugu hosting segments such as the Brazilian version of [[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]], called ''Passa ou Repassa'' (known for its \"[[pieing|Torta na Cara]]\" segment) and ''Cidade contra Cidade''. SBT broadcast the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], two years after its [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] coverage.\n\n===1990s===\nThe TVS brand was merged into the SBT brand in 1990; the name change was seen in a new campaign ad modeled on NBC's ''\"Come Home to NBC\"'' campaign of 1986-87, which premiered early that year, and in August on TV station identifications celebrating SBT's ninth year of broadcasts (that year, Silvio Santos sold Record as a national network) and it also broadcast the 1990 FIFA World Cup. 1991 saw the beginning of its newscast ''Aqui Agora'' and Serginho Groisman's ''Programa Livre'' variety show, just a few of the many successes for the year even as the network's S\u00e3o Paulo studios suffered damages due to massive floods that hit the city. In 1992 SBT and Rede Globo jointly broadcast the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] nationwide, with a grand advertising campaign for the Brazilian national team. Despite problems and even the transfer of talents to other stations (such as the then resurgent [[Rede Record]]), the 90s proved to be a boom for the network.\n\nSBT invested in its own ''[[telenovelas]]'' and remakes of successful ones from foreign networks (most notably [[Chiquititas (1997 Brazilian TV series)|Chiquititas]]), variety programs, news and current affairs, and broadcast rights for sporting events (including the [[Copa Mercosur]], Copa do Brasil and [[Champ Car]]). It signed host Carlos \"Ratinho\" Massa in 1998, obtained more Mexican productions and launched [[game shows]] (such as ''[[Show do Milh\u00e3o]]'') in 1999. By the end of the decade SBT held second place in the Brazilian ratings, after Globo, strengthed by a brand new and technologically advanced television complex, the CDT da Anhanguera, inaugurated in 1996, just in time for its 15th anniversary.\n\n====Ad campaigns====\n{{anchor|American and Australian imports}}\n;American and Australian imports\nThe 1990s were SBT's most fruitful decade for American-style ad campaigns:\n* 1987\u20131990: NBC's second installment of \"Come Home to NBC\",  with ''\"Vem Que \u00e9 Bom\"'' with the graphics of 1988's \"Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC\"\n* 1986\u20131991: NBC's first year of \"Come Home\", with ''\"10 anos com voc\u00ea\"'' (the 10th-anniversary slogan)\n* 1990\u20131991 and 1993\u201394: [[CBS]]'s second year of \"Get Ready for CBS\" with ''\"Se liga no SBT\"''. On January 20, 1991, the Australian Network Ten launched \"That's Entertainment\" to coincide with a logo change, using in-house music and similar graphics\n* 1989\u20131992 and 1995: ABC's first year of \"America's Watching [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\" became ''\"Fique ligado no SBT\"''. In 1992 Ten launched \"This Is It\" with its promo based on the music from \"America's Watching\", in a different key with different instrumentation and vocals.\n{{anchor|In-house productions}}\n;Domestic campaigns\n* In 1992, the one-minute spot ''\"Aqui Tem\"'' was launched for network-wide use. The promo featured an in-house soundtrack (with similarities to NBC's \"Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC\" campaign of 1988-89) and graphic elements from NBC's 1991 campaign, \"The Place to Be\".\n* In August 1996 SBT launched a new logo (replacing its multicoloured stripes with solid colours) and relaunched \"QPAA\" with a new slogan, ''\"Tudo Pra Voc\u00ea\"'', for its 15th anniversary.\n* In 1997, SBT made its new graphics based on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s 1996 campaign, Watched by More People.\n* In 1998 the network released ''\"A cara do Brasil\"'', with new graphics and soundtrack.\n* In 1999 the network produced ''\"Na nossa frente, so voc\u00ea\"'', with new graphics and music. The 64-second promo was used on-air for the first time in 2000; the slogan was used until 2004 with two songs composed for this. The 1st campaign spot (1999-2000) mirrored the [[Nine Network]]'s 1997 promo spots but with an original soundtrack.\n\n===2000s===\nSBT began the decade investing in movies, broadcasting a package of [[Disney]] (now affiliated with Rede Globo) and [[Time Warner]] productions (the latter promoted in a one-hour network block). In 2001, the controversial [[reality show]] ''Casa dos Artistas'', accused by many of being a copy of [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', marked the first time SBT led the Sunday-night ratings, aside from its ''Domingo Legal'' program becoming no.1 in the Sunday afternoon ratings.\n\nSince 2003, with the ratings advances of [[RecordTV]] and [[Rede Bandeirantes]], SBT's ratings have declined. Two events that year marked the beginning of its problems:\n* Early in the year Silvio Santos gave an interview with the TV-gossip magazine ''Contigo!'', in which he stated that he was ill and had sold SBT. Later, he claimed that this was intended as a joke.\n* The \"Gugu-PCC scandal\": On September 7 ''Domingo Legal'' aired an interview with alleged members of the criminal group PCC, threatening the deputy mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo and the hosts of police reality programs on the compteting TV Record and Rede TV! networks. Later, it was discovered that this was a hoax; the program was suspended for a week, its audience never recovered and Gugu Liberato (its host, once seen as Santos' successor) never regained his credibility.\n\nSince then SBT has aired the successful ''[[Rebelde (Brazilian telenovela)|Rebelde]]'' and shows with child host [[Maisa Silva]], who became popular; however, programs could change without previous announcement (even hosts were sometimes out of the loop), confusing the audience. In 2006, SBT celebrated its 25th anniversary in a deepening crisis.\n\nSBT is the second-largest network in the country, vying for leadership with [[Rede Record]]. The [[CDT da Anhanguera]] is the second-largest television-production center in Brazil, behind [[Projac]] (owned by [[Rede Globo]]). Over 5,000 employees work around the clock at SBT's 110 TV stations.\nIn 2008 the network lost second place in the ratings to Record, but tied for second place the following year.\nIn 2009, Liberato moved to Record after more than 20 years with SBT; at the same time, SBT signed presenters Roberto Justus and Eliana from Record. It also appeared on [[SKY Brasil]], the last of the five major Brazilian networks to do so.\n\nRecent programs include ''What's Your Talent'', a local combination of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' and ''[[Show de Calouros]]'' (created and hosted by [[Silvio Santos]] during the 1970s); a Brazilian version of ''[[1 vs. 100]]''; an annual telethon, which raised R$19 million in 2009; ''[[Kyle XY]]''; the reality show ''[[Solitary (TV series)|Solitary]]''; ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and ''De Frente with Gabi'', a talk show featuring journalist Marilia Gabriela.\n\nTV Alagoas left the network in September 2009 and to broadcast religious programs, and SBT executive director William Stoliar sued to ensure the network's availability [[Alagoas|there]]. It returned to SBT on June 1, 2010, due to viewer pressure and late rent payments by religious programs.\n\nIn February 2014, the [[Communist Party of Brazil]] sends to the Federal Government a questioning, for which he cut around 75 million dollars in advertising the broadcaster, because of criticism that the journalist Rachel Sheherazade makes against the Government.<ref>http://www.cartacapital.com.br/sociedade/comentario-de-sheherazade-leva-deputados-a-questionar-verba-publicitaria-do-governo-ao-sbt-252.html</ref>\n\n== SBT staff ==\n[[File:Carlos

In 1998 it ran the longest children's programming block in Brazilian TV history with [[TV Cultura]], from ''Sess\u00e3o Desenho'' (a cartoon block) at 7:00 am (after the morning newscast) until 9:00 pm (when the children's [[telenovela]] ''[[Chiquititas]]'' ended). SBT promoted the 14-hour block as \"SBT Kids\".\n\nWhile most TV stations in Brazil depend on domestic productions, SBT relies on imports (mainly from Mexico and the U.S.). Since 1984, ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'' (shown in Brazil as ''Chaves'') is one of the station's most popular programs. The network had until 2014 an agreement with Warner Brothers, giving it an exclusivity deal for its sitcoms, dramas and films.\n\nMexican ''telenovelas'' have been a staple on SBT, reaching their peak during the early 1990s with the child-oriented ''[[Carrusel]]'', ''[[La usurpadora (1998 TV series)|La usurpadora]]'', ''[[El Privilegio de Amar]]'' and ''[[Luz Clarita]]'' and the popular \"Mar\u00eda trilogy\" (''[[Mar\u00eda Mercedes (telenovela)|Mar\u00eda Mercedes]]'', ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' and ''[[Mar\u00eda la del Barrio]]''). Compared to subdued Brazilian telenovelas, Mexican soaps are considered tacky and exaggerated.\n\nOther 1990s hits included ''[[Domingo Legal]]'' (''Cool Sunday'') (a Sunday variety show which was SBT's highest-rated program, surpassing ''TV Globo''), and the network was the most popular channel in Brazil for hours at a stretch. ''Domingo Legal'' was criticized for its sensationalism, and its ratings began to fall after the ''[[Primeiro Comando da Capital]]'' (PCC) scandal (see [[#2000s|below]]); the show often ranks second in the ratings. Other popular programs included ''[[Programa do Ratinho]]'' (''Ratinho's Show'', with a similar format to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''), ''[[Show do Milh\u00e3o]]'' (''The Million Show'', similar to ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]]''), ''[[Topa Tudo por Dinheiro]]'' (''Variety show large audience that was aired on Sunday night between 1991 to 2001''), [[Fantasia (Brazilian television program)|''Fantasia'']] (Entertainment program where people could play games by phoning the program in order to earn money), and the Brazilian version of the Argentinean soap opera''[[Chiquititas]]'', popular with children.\n\nFor over 20 years SBT held second place in the Brazilian television ratings (behind [[Rede Globo]]), but in February 2007 it was outpaced by [[Rede Record]] for the first time in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. However, after a period of resurgence which started in 2011, SBT successfully overtook Record for second place in June 2014.\n\nSince their 1990s peak in popularity, Mexican ''telenovelas'' have been steadily declining in the ratings; the last popular Mexican soap operas were ''[[Carita de \u00c1ngel]]'' in the early 2000s and ''[[Rebelde (Mexican telenovela)|Rebelde]]'' in 2006. In 2001, SBT began remaking Mexican soaps with Brazilian actors. The first soaps (''Picara Sonhadora'' and ''[[Marisol (Braziilan TV series)|Marisol]]'') did fairly well in the ratings; however, later soaps (''[[Cristal (telenovela)|Cristal]]'', ''Os Ricos Tamb\u00e9m Choram'' and ''Maria Esperan\u00e7a'', a version of the popular ''Maria Mercedes'') were less popular.\n\nIn addition to Mexican soaps and their remakes, the channel also airs cartoons mornings and programs such as ''\u00cddolos'' (a Brazilian version of ''[[American Idol]]'' which later moved to TV Record), a Brazilian version of ''[[Supernanny]]'',  a version of ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' (presented by Silvio Santos, who also presents many network programs), talent shows and a dating show.

Bernard Delhemme was the captain of the flight.<ref name=\"Mayday\">{{Cite episode |title=The Killing Machine |series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]] |network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]] |season=2 |number=3|year=2004}}</ref> Jean-Paul Borderie was the copilot, and Alain Bossuat was the flight engineer.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The [[Airbus A300B2-1C]], tail number F-GBEC, had first flown on 28 February 1980.<ref name=\"ASN\">{{cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A300B2-1C F-GBEC Marseille\u2013Marignane Airport (MRS) |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19941226-0 |date=14 November 2015 |website=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Hijacking==\n\n===24 December===\nOn 24 December 1994, at [[Houari Boumedienne Airport]] in [[Algiers]], four armed men boarded Air France Flight 8969 which was due to depart for [[Orly Airport]], [[Paris, France|Paris]] at 11:15&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The men were dressed as Algerian presidential police; they wore blue uniforms with [[Air Alg\u00e9rie]] logos. Their presence originally did not cause any alarm.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Two of the men began inspecting the passengers' passports while one went into the cockpit and the fourth stood guard. Claude Burgniard, a [[flight attendant]], recalled noticing that the \"police\" were armed and one of them had dynamite showing, which she considered to be unusual as the Algerian police were not normally armed when carrying out checks. The Algerian military felt suspicious on noticing that the Air France flight appeared to have an unauthorised delay, so they began surrounding the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled seeing members of the [[Special Intervention Group]] (GIS), known as \"[[ninja]]s\", outside the aircraft. Kakachi recalled hearing one of the \"police\" say \"taghut,\" an Arabic word for \"[[infidel]]\", upon seeing the GIS men gathering outside the A300; she then realised that the four men on board the plane were terrorists. The four hijackers then revealed that they were not police, but [[mujahideen]] seeking to establish an [[Islamic state]] in Algeria. They had hijacked the aircraft because the national airline Air France was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe leader, Abdul Abdullah Yahia, already a notorious murderer, and the other three members of the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (Groupe Islamique Arm\u00e9, or GIA) brandished firearms and explosives and announced their allegiance to the GIA, demanding co-operation from the 220 passengers and 12 flight crew.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers had [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] assault rifles, [[Uzi]] submachine guns, pistols, homemade [[hand grenade]]s and two 10-stick [[dynamite]] packs. Later, at one point during the flight, the men placed one pack of dynamite in the cockpit and one pack under a seat in the middle of the aircraft, then linked them with detonator wire.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> They also took the uniforms of the pilots to confuse Algerian army [[sniper]]s.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n<!--Did Abdul Abdullah Yahia say this next bit to the passengers?-->\n{{quote|text=Allah has chosen us to die and Allah has chosen you to die with us. Allah guarantees our success, [[Insha'Allah]].\n|author=Abdul Abdullah Yahia<ref name=\"Mayday\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRHbJCPRhM Zero Hour: Shootout in Marseille]</ref>}}\n\nBurgniard recalled that the hijackers, in particular one called \"Lotfi\", disliked seeing a lack of adherence to their Islamic beliefs; according to Burgniard, the hijackers objected to men and women sitting together and sharing the same toilets and women having their heads uncovered. Once they had taken control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced the women to cover their heads, including the cabin crew members.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets as head coverings. An elderly Algerian man told the ''[[TF1]]'' network that the hijackers \"had a kind of art in their terror. Twenty minutes of relaxation and twenty minutes of torture. You never knew what was next.\"<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nThe men stated over the aircraft's cockpit radio: {{quote|text=We are the Soldiers of Mercy. [[Allah]] has selected us as his soldiers. We are here to wage war in his name.\n|author=Abdul Abdullah Yahia<ref>Taylor (2008), 1:25 and 2:20 minutes in.</ref>}}\n\nAbderrahmane Meziane Ch\u00e9rif, the [[Minister of the Interior]] of Algeria, came to the airport control tower to begin negotiating with the hijackers, who were using the captain to speak for them. They demanded the release of two [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) political party leaders, [[Abassi Madani]] and [[Ali Belhadj]], who were under [[house arrest]]; the FIS was banned in Algeria in 1992. Ch\u00e9rif demanded that the hijackers begin releasing children and the elderly if they wanted to talk to the Algerian government.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The media began arriving at the airport to cover the crisis.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nAt noon, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]], organised a crisis team, and [[Charles Pasqua]], [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister of France]], met his aides. French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] was recalled from his Christmas holiday in [[Chamonix]], France, and other government officials were also summoned from their vacations.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Balladur recollected spending the entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine what was happening and feeling confused. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted to crack down on the terrorists and Balladur himself encountered difficulties discussing the events.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the FIS party leaders.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Two hours into the hijacking, the men told the captain to depart for Paris so that they could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off because the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the plane and the Algerian authorities were blocking the runway with parked vehicles. When the hijackers forced the captain to ask for the boarding stairs to be removed, the Algerian authorities refused, determined not to give in to any of the hijackers' demands. The GIA men announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities followed their orders.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nDuring the passport check, the hijackers had noticed that one of the passengers on the flight was an Algerian police officer. In order to force the Algerian government to comply with their demands, the hijackers approached the police officer and told him to follow them. Kakachi remembered that the police officer, seated two rows behind her, was hesitant as he did not know what they were going to do.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Several passengers recalled him pleading \"Don't kill me, I have a wife and child!\"<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The hijackers shot the police officer in the head at the top of the boarding stairs. The pilots and most of the passengers were not aware at first that the man had been killed. Captain Delhemme recalled that his first contact with the passenger cabin during the hijacking was when a flight attendant, allowed into the cockpit, asked the pilots if they needed anything. According to Delhemme, he asked for a glass of water from the attendant to ease the pilots' parched throats. At this point, the attendant whispered to Delhemme that the hijackers had killed a passenger.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe Algerian authorities still refused to agree to the hijackers' demands. Burgniard recalled that he and the other occupants began to realise that \"things were going wrong\" when the hijackers came to collect another passenger.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> They selected 48-year-old Bui Giang To, a commercial attach\u00e9 at the Embassy of Vietnam in Algeria.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Burgniard described To as \"the real foreigner on this plane\". She remembered that To was not intimidated by the hijackers and she believed that this attitude upset the hijackers. The Vietnamese diplomat thought he was about to be released because he was a foreigner; instead he was shot dead on the boarding stairs. Delhemme recalled that when the flight attendant next appeared with refreshments, she whispered to him that two passengers, not one, had died.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe French government wanted to bring French military personnel into Algeria to safely resolve the hijacking, but the Algerian government would not allow foreign military to land on Algerian soil to resolve an Algerian political crisis. Prime Minister Balladur said that he asked the Algerian government \"extremely forcefully and urgently\" to give permission for the aircraft to take off. He felt that the French government held responsibility for solving the problem as the aircraft belonged to a French airline and almost a third of the passengers were French.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nSeven hours into the hijacking, the cabin was calm but tense; at that point, few of the passengers knew that two people had been killed. It had grown dark outside and the aircraft was surrounded by spotlights. The pilots now attempted to defuse the situation by talking to the hijackers and trying to gain their trust. Delhemme explained that the beginning of a hijacking is violent, so the role of the pilot is to keep the participants calm, \"buy time\", show the hijackers who the crew are as people, and find out details about the hijackers; then the pilot has to try gaining the trust of the hijackers.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nDuring the night, Spanish authorities allowed the French military to send its forces to [[Majorca]], Spain, which was as close to Algeria as was possible without being accused of interfering in the situation.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> At 8:00&nbsp;pm, [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale]] (GIGN) operatives boarded an [[Airbus A300]] aircraft similar to F-GBEC, the hijacked plane, at a military base in France.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> En route to Majorca, the GIGN operatives were able to familiarise themselves with the A300 in preparation for storming the aircraft.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> After the GIGN's plane arrived at [[Palma de Mallorca Airport]], the Algerian government made it clear that French forces were not welcome in Algeria.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\n===25 December===\nCaptain Delhemme made a tour of the cabin at about 2:00 am the next morning to check on the situation; he said that the cabin was \"calm\" during that time. He noticed two of the hijackers asleep on the floor.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> In the morning, French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Balladur flew to Paris.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nNew information arrived at the [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] of France in [[Oran]], Algeria, via a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in the GIA: {{quote|We received this information directly from members of the Algerian secret service. And this information was very worrying. The terrorists' true aim was to crash the plane in Paris.|[[Minister of the Interior (France)|French Minister of the Interior]] [[Charles Pasqua]]<ref name=\"Taylor9\">Taylor (2008), 9 minutes in.</ref>}}\n\nPolice confirmed this plan after a raid on a [[safe house]].<ref name=\"Taylor9\"/>\n\nThe hijackers released some of the passengers, mainly women with young children and those with severe medical conditions. Over 170 people still remained on board the plane. The hijackers offered to release the remaining Algerian passengers, but the Algerians refused to leave the aircraft. Delhemme recalled that one passenger who was refusing to leave said that he thought the crew would be killed if he did, and Delhemme believes that the passengers' motives were sincere.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> By the end of 25 December, the hijackers had freed a total of 63 passengers.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Taylor625\">Taylor (2008), 6:25 minutes in.</ref>\n\nThe Algerian police used [[night vision]] devices to identify the lead hijacker, who was Abdul Abdullah Yahia.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The French government sent Yahia's mother to plead for him to release the passengers, in the hope that she could persuade her son to give in,<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> but the tactic backfired. One passenger, Kakachi, recalled Yahia becoming enraged by this move. At this point, the hijackers began targeting the French passengers; there were two staff members of the French Embassy in Algiers on board the flight, a secretary and a chef.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers forced the chef, Yannick Beugnet, to plead into the microphone. Through Beugnet, they demanded that unless the Algerian government cleared the A300 for takeoff before 9:30&nbsp;pm, they would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw him out of the door. The Algerian passengers assured him that the hijackers were bluffing while the French passengers were demanding that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the 9:30 deadline passed, the hijackers shot the chef and threw his body outside.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Nundy |title=Jet hijackers die as 170 are freed |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/jet-hijackers-die-as-170-are-freed-1390663.html |date=27 December 1994  |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, \"See what you get when you play tough?!\"<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The airline knew that the chef had been murdered as it was listening in on the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, said in an interview that the airline employees \"lived through [the event] with great emotion\". Zahida Kakachi recalled Lotfi calmly trying to convert her and another stewardess to [[Islam]], though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage him.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe French government were informed of the events. Balladur spoke on the telephone to the [[Prime Minister of Algeria]], [[Mokdad Sifi]]; he told him that the French government would hold the Algerian government responsible for the outcome if it did not authorise them to intervene in the situation.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Just before midnight, Balladur told the [[President of Algeria]], [[Liamine Z\u00e9roual]], that France was ready to receive the Air France flight.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> As a result of Balladur's demands, 39 hours after the start of the hijacking, Z\u00e9roual allowed the aircraft to leave Algiers. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard recalled that everyone was relieved when the aircraft departed because they thought the crisis was over.\n\nThere was insufficient fuel on board the plane to reach Paris, because the [[auxiliary power unit]] had been running since the hijackers took over the plane, so a refuelling stop was scheduled at [[Marseille Provence Airport]]. Delhemme confronted Yahia to find out whether he planned to blow up the aircraft between Algiers and Marseille. Yahia insisted that the plane would fly to Marseille, take on fuel, then fly to Paris for the press conference; reassured, Delhemme prepared for takeoff. In an interview, Delhemme suggested that the hijackers would probably have said this anyway to prevent the crew from taking action against them. Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in the cockpit, seemed excited and \"like kids\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n===26 December===\nThe aircraft approached Marseille during the early hours of 26 December. The hijackers did not know that Major [[Denis Favier]]'s [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] squad was already in Marseille,<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> having flown from Majorca to a military base near Marseille, and planned to storm the aircraft while it was in Marseille. The GIGN squad practised entering the A300 before Flight 8969 arrived in Marseille.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Favier explained in an interview that the enemy was arriving in friendly territory, and the power difference would be a key element in the struggle.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The Flight 8969 aircraft landed at 3:33&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nSteward Claude Burgniard said that the hijackers felt that the landing in Marseille was a \"magic moment\" as they had arrived in France. Burgniard recalled that the airport was dark and that she only saw the lights of the A300 and a car that the A300 followed. The French authorities deliberately led the aircraft away from the terminal and into a remote corner of the airport. By 26 December, the French government had received information stating that the hijackers had planned to attack Paris. Favier planned to appear conciliatory and prolong the negotiations as long as possible. He believed that the hijackers were tired, so he planned to wear them down.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Alain Gehin, the Chief of Police of Marseille, spoke to the group of hijackers in the control tower. Gehin implemented Favier's strategy.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nWhile using Delhemme to speak for them,<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> the hijackers asked for 27 tonnes of fuel; the aircraft needed approximately 9 tonnes<!--9 from Mayday, 10 from TIME--> to fly to Paris from Marseille. The request indicated to the French authorities that the aircraft was going to be used as a firebomb or to fly the aircraft to an Islamic country sympathetic to the hijackers' cause. Hours later, the authorities received word of the firebomb plot. Passengers who were released in Algiers stated that the A300 had been rigged with explosives. Demolition experts determined that the plane was likely rigged in a way that would cause it to explode.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> [[Charles Pasqua]] said in an interview that the French government had decided that the aircraft was not going to leave Marseille, regardless of the consequences.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nAt around 8:00&nbsp;am, the hijackers demanded that the forces let the aircraft take off by 9:40&nbsp;am. The negotiators delayed the ultimatum by giving the aircraft additional food and water, emptying the toilet tanks, and providing vacuum cleaners. The GIGN operatives servicing the aircraft were disguised as airport personnel. They discovered the aircraft doors were not blocked or [[booby trap]]ped.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The men planted eavesdropping devices while others trained long-range \"cannon\" microphones on the A300's fuselage and windows.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Favier's group asked the hijackers if they would rather do a press conference in Marseille instead of Paris, since all of the major media outlets had bureaux in Marseille. The hijackers agreed to hold a press conference on the A300. The negotiators requested that the front of the aircraft be cleared for the press conference. This was to create an area for the GIGN during the storming of the aircraft. Favier explained in an interview that the press conference was an important tactic as it allowed the passengers to be moved to the rear of the aircraft. The hijackers did not realise that the doors of the A300 could be opened from the outside.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nTwelve hours after the A300 arrived at Marseille, the GIGN knew how many hijackers were on board and their location on the aircraft with the help of eavesdropping devices, infrared vision equipment, and \"cannon\" microphones.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> It intended to wait until sunset to take advantage of the darkness. The occupants of the aircraft were unaware of the GIGN's true motives, and the militants were confused about why the press had not yet arrived. Yahia, frustrated by the absence of the press and sensing the authorities were up to something, ordered the pilot to move the aircraft. Dellemme parked the aircraft at the foot of the [[airport control tower]] and in close proximity to the terminal and other aircraft. An explosion in this position would result in many more casualties than in the earlier, remote location.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThis was a tactical disadvantage for the GIGN; the positions were based on the aircraft being parked where the French authorities ordered the placement of the A300. When the aircraft moved, the GIGN had to quickly reorganise its forces. Favier placed snipers on the roof so they would have a view of the cockpit. He organised a group of thirty men with three [[Ground support equipment#Passenger boarding steps/stairs|passenger boarding stairs]] to rush the aircraft and take it over. Favier planned to have two teams, each with 11 people, open the rear left and rear right doors of the A300. A third team of eight would open the front right door. The forces planned to isolate the cockpit, with Yahia, from the rest of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nBy 5:00&nbsp;pm, the authorities had not delivered any amount of fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected the youngest member of the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an [[atheist]]. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying \"I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.\"<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the [[Quran]] on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but \"nothing like what seemed to be about to happen\". Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n====Raid====\n\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Raid on Air France Flight 8969\n|date=26 December 1994\n|place=[[Marseille]], France\n|result=GIGN victory\n|combatant1={{flagicon|France}} [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]]\n|combatant2=[[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|GIA]]\n|commander1={{flagicon|France}} Major [[Denis Favier]]\n|commander2=Abdul Abdullah Yahia{{KIA}}\n|strength1=30 GIGN Operators\n|strength2=4 hijackers\n|casualties1=9 wounded\n|casualties2=4 killed\n|casualties3=3 passengers were already dead prior to the raid<br />\n13 passengers wounded<br />\n3 crew wounded\n}}\n\nOnce the hijackers noticed the [[airstair]]s moving towards them, they recognised the imminent assault. Through the cockpit window, a hijacker fired upon the airstair containing the forward GIGN team. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, it became apparent that it was elevated too high relative to the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Written without a source - we need to be sure it was a mistake if we're going to mention it}} After a short delay in repositioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers in the rear of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nFlight attendant Claude Burgniard described the firefight as \"the apocalypse\". Christophe Morin, a flight attendant, recalled that the GIGN ordered passengers and crew to get down as low as possible with their hands over their heads, hide, and then to not move. Morin described the situation as \"violent\". He recalled putting his overcoat over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands. Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in \"a rather bad spot\", so he crouched and made himself \"as small as possible\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nA few minutes after the beginning of the assault, most of the passengers had escaped. At that point, three of the four hijackers were fatally shot. Delhemme recalled that the cockpit only had himself, the flight engineer, and the last hijacker. Delhemme said that the hijacker could have killed him and his colleagues out of spite, but did not. In an interview, Denis Favier explained that there likely was a mutual recognition and \"respect\" between the hijackers and the hostages. He believes the bonds between the hijackers and hostages helped save lives of passengers and crew in the conflict.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nGIGN commando Philippe Bardelli was leading a column up the front right airstair, as that team was tasked with throwing stun grenades in the cockpit, when a 7.62 \u00d7 39&nbsp;mm bullet from an [[AK-47]] hit his drawn pistol and detonated the cartridges; Bardelli later remarked that his pistol which was hit saved his life since such AK-47 rounds were able to penetrate the GIGN's helmet visors.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBzxzyFhU2w</ref> The remaining hijacker kept the GIGN at bay for 20 minutes, but he eventually ran out of ammunition and died from a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, the GIGN operatives were not sure which men were the hijackers and how many were still alive, so they considered all male passengers as potentially being hijackers.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The flight engineer, Alain Bossuat, radioed the tower stating that the hijackers were dead and that there were no more left.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> This signaled to GIGN forces that a final clearing of the A300 could begin. Delhemme said that when the forces entered the aircraft, they ordered him to put his hands on his head. Delhemme said that, after the hijacking ordeal had run its course, he refused to leave with his hands on his head and be \"punished like a child\". Burgniard said that when she saw Bossuat handcuffed, the cabin crew told the forces to let him go as the individual was the flight engineer.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> At 5:35&nbsp;pm, Favier radioed to the tower that the incident was over; the incident unfolded in 54 hours.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nAll of the hijackers had been killed. The remaining passengers and crew survived the 20-minute gun battle.<sup id=\"fn_a_back\">[[#fn a|A]]</sup><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Of the remaining passengers, 13 received minor injuries.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Nine of the 30 GIGN operatives received injuries; of them, one received serious wounds.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Three crew members received injuries.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Delhemme was hit by bullets in his right elbow and thigh.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Bossuat received minor injuries; the dead bodies of two hijackers had shielded Delhemme and Bossuat from gunfire. Borderie, the most seriously injured, fractured his elbow and thigh from the 5-metre (16&nbsp;ft) drop.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Favier said that he determined that the operation was a success since none of the GIGN received fatal injuries. French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] said that the events unfolded \"exceptionally well\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs a result of the damage to the aircraft, the A300 was [[written off]].<ref name=\"ASN\"/> Several hours after the incident ended, the Armed Islamic Group, which had claimed responsibility for the event, killed four [[Roman Catholic]] priests in retaliation in [[Tizi-Ouzou]], Algeria. Three of the priests were French, while one was Belgian.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nThe crew of the A300 and the GIGN forces received high national honours. [[Charles Pasqua]], then the [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], said that throughout the ordeal the crew \"rose to the occasion\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Bernard Delhemme returned to flying and worked for Air France for nine years before retiring. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard said that she \"kept seeing the faces\" of the three passengers who had been executed; when she received her medal she realised that she had helped save 173 people; this allowed her to mourn and get over the incident. Burgniard said that she does not wear the medal, but that she felt like she deserved it. Burgniard, who also received a message of thanks from the airline, never again worked for Air France. Flight attendant Christophe Morin stopped working for Air France and began to work for a charitable organisation.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nA former militant group leader admitted that the men had planned to detonate the aircraft over the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The militant group never again attempted this plot. Pasqua said that if the militants crashed an aircraft on the Eiffel Tower or the [[Palais de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e|\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]], they would have committed what they would believe to be \"an extraordinary feat.\"<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nFlights between Algiers and Paris are now Flights 1555, 1855, 2155, and 2455 (operating to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] instead of Orly).<ref>[http://info.flightmapper.net/route/Air_France_AF_ALG_CDG Air France flights from Algiers to Charles De Gaulle, Paris.]</ref> Flight number 8969 is now a [[codeshare]] flight number for [[Delta Air Lines]] flight number 1584 between [[Greater Rochester International Airport]] and [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]].<ref>[http://info.flightmapper.net/flight/Air_France_AF_8969 AF8969 schedule.

The negotiators said that Yahia spoke \"approximate\" French and always ended his sentences in \"[[Insha'Allah]]\" (\"God willing\").<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Several passengers said all but one of the hijackers had no beards and closely cropped hair. A woman said that the men \"were polite and correct\" and that they \"had the determined air of cold-blooded killers\". Another passenger said the hijackers \"seemed excited, very euphoric\" and that they told the occupants that they would teach the French and the world a lesson and show what they were capable of doing.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nAs the hijacking progressed, the passengers recognised the personalities of the hijackers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled that the crew and passengers gave nicknames to the hijackers \"to make things simpler\". Yahia, the leader, had given his name, so the passengers called him by that name. According to Burgniard, Lotfi had a \"peculiar\" character, \"was always on a knife edge\", and \"the most fanatic\" and \"the most fundamentalist\" of the hijackers. Therefore, he received the nickname \"Madman\" from the passengers. According to Burgniard, Lotfi was the hijacker who insisted that the passengers follow Islamic law. Lotfi found women having their heads uncovered \"intolerable\", making him very angry. One hijacker did not give his name to the passengers, so they called him \"Bill\". Burgniard stated that Bill was \"a little bit simple\" and \"more of a goatherd than a terrorist.\" She said his role as a hijacker was \"an error in casting\". Burgniard remembered that the occupants wondered why Bill was there and that they saw Bill appearing as if he wondered why he was there, as well. The hijacker nicknamed \"The Killer\" shot the hostages whom the hijackers had targeted.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The events of Flight 8969 were featured in \"The Killing Machine\", a [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 2 (2004)|Season 2 (2004)]] episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> (called ''Air Emergency'' and ''Air Disasters'' in the U.S. and ''Air Crash Investigation'' in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatisation was broadcast  with the title \"Hijacked\" in the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia; and in the United States as \"Hijack Rescue\". The episode uses a mix of re-enactments and actual footage. Flight 8969 captain Bernard Delhemme and Colonel Denis Favier, then a major who was head of the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] counter-terrorist unit assigned to the flight, gave their first television interviews for ''Mayday'', appearing in silhouette, as both felt under threat after the events and that members of the public believed that the militants were offering a reward for Favier's assassination. Eli Gemael, a Canadian actor of Jewish and Lebanese heritage, played lead hijacker Abdul Yahia.\n* The incident was also featured in an episode of the ''[[Zero Hour (2004 TV series)|Zero Hour]]'' television series called \"Shoot-Out in Marseille\". Using a mix of real footage and reenactment, it suggests that two of the terrorists were killed by the GIGN snipers.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mazurinas|first=Osmanas|title=Zero Hour Shoot Out in Marseilles|date=24 July 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBzxzyFhU2w}}</ref> Gemael reprises his role as Yahia for this dramatization.\n* A one-hour documentary, episode 3 of the UK [[BBC Two]] television series ''The Age of Terror'', was transmitted on 29 April 2008.

The terrorists murdered three passengers and their intention was to blow up the plane over the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris.

Aircraft flying to Algeria faced the possibility of missile attacks. As a result, [[Air France|Air France's]] flights to Algiers had crews entirely made of people who volunteered for the route. Air France had asked government officials if it absolutely had to continue flying to Algeria; by the time of the hijacking, they had not received a reply. Bernard Delhemme was the captain of the flight.<ref name=\"Mayday\">{{Cite episode |title=The Killing Machine |series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]] |network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]] |season=2 |number=3|year=2004}}</ref> Jean-Paul Borderie was the copilot, and Alain Bossuat was the flight engineer.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The [[Airbus A300B2-1C]], tail number F-GBEC, had first flown on 28 February 1980.<ref name=\"ASN\">{{cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A300B2-1C F-GBEC Marseille\u2013Marignane Airport (MRS) |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19941226-0 |date=14 November 2015 |website=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Hijacking==\n\n===24 December===\nOn 24 December 1994, at [[Houari Boumedienne Airport]] in [[Algiers]], four armed men boarded Air France Flight 8969 which was due to depart for [[Orly Airport]], [[Paris, France|Paris]] at 11:15&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The men were dressed as Algerian presidential police; they wore blue uniforms with [[Air Alg\u00e9rie]] logos. Their presence originally did not cause any alarm.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Two of the men began inspecting the passengers' passports while one went into the cockpit and the fourth stood guard. Claude Burgniard, a [[flight attendant]], recalled noticing that the \"police\" were armed and one of them had dynamite showing, which she considered to be unusual as the Algerian police were not normally armed when carrying out checks. The Algerian military felt suspicious on noticing that the Air France flight appeared to have an unauthorised delay, so they began surrounding the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled seeing members of the [[Special Intervention Group]] (GIS), known as \"[[ninja]]s\", outside the aircraft. Kakachi recalled hearing one of the \"police\" say \"taghut,\" an Arabic word for \"[[infidel]]\", upon seeing the GIS men gathering outside the A300; she then realised that the four men on board the plane were terrorists. The four hijackers then revealed that they were not police, but [[mujahideen]] seeking to establish an [[Islamic state]] in Algeria. They had hijacked the aircraft because the national airline Air France was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe leader, Abdul Abdullah Yahia, already a notorious murderer, and the other three members of the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (Groupe Islamique Arm\u00e9, or GIA) brandished firearms and explosives and announced their allegiance to the GIA, demanding co-operation from the 220 passengers and 12 flight crew.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers had [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] assault rifles, [[Uzi]] submachine guns, pistols, homemade [[hand grenade]]s and two 10-stick [[dynamite]] packs. Later, at one point during the flight, the men placed one pack of dynamite in the cockpit and one pack under a seat in the middle of the aircraft, then linked them with detonator wire.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> They also took the uniforms of the pilots to confuse Algerian army [[sniper]]s.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n<!--Did Abdul Abdullah Yahia say this next bit to the passengers?-->\n{{quote|text=Allah has chosen us to die and Allah has chosen you to die with us.

Once they had taken control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced the women to cover their heads, including the cabin crew members.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets as head coverings. An elderly Algerian man told the ''[[TF1]]'' network that the hijackers \"had a kind of art in their terror. Twenty minutes of relaxation and twenty minutes of torture. You never knew what was next.\"<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nThe men stated over the aircraft's cockpit radio: {{quote|text=We are the Soldiers of Mercy. [[Allah]] has selected us as his soldiers.

They demanded the release of two [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) political party leaders, [[Abassi Madani]] and [[Ali Belhadj]], who were under [[house arrest]]; the FIS was banned in Algeria in 1992. Ch\u00e9rif demanded that the hijackers begin releasing children and the elderly if they wanted to talk to the Algerian government.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The media began arriving at the airport to cover the crisis.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nAt noon, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]], organised a crisis team, and [[Charles Pasqua]], [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister of France]], met his aides. French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] was recalled from his Christmas holiday in [[Chamonix]], France, and other government officials were also summoned from their vacations.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Balladur recollected spending the entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine what was happening and feeling confused. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted to crack down on the terrorists and Balladur himself encountered difficulties discussing the events.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the FIS party leaders.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Two hours into the hijacking, the men told the captain to depart for Paris so that they could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off because the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the plane and the Algerian authorities were blocking the runway with parked vehicles. When the hijackers forced the captain to ask for the boarding stairs to be removed, the Algerian authorities refused, determined not to give in to any of the hijackers' demands. The GIA men announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities followed their orders.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nDuring the passport check, the hijackers had noticed that one of the passengers on the flight was an Algerian police officer. In order to force the Algerian government to comply with their demands, the hijackers approached the police officer and told him to follow them. Kakachi remembered that the police officer, seated two rows behind her, was hesitant as he did not know what they were going to do.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Several passengers recalled him pleading \"Don't kill me, I have a wife and child!\"<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The hijackers shot the police officer in the head at the top of the boarding stairs. The pilots and most of the passengers were not aware at first that the man had been killed. Captain Delhemme recalled that his first contact with the passenger cabin during the hijacking was when a flight attendant, allowed into the cockpit, asked the pilots if they needed anything. According to Delhemme, he asked for a glass of water from the attendant to ease the pilots' parched throats. At this point, the attendant whispered to Delhemme that the hijackers had killed a passenger.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe Algerian authorities still refused to agree to the hijackers' demands. Burgniard recalled that he and the other occupants began to realise that \"things were going wrong\" when the hijackers came to collect another passenger.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> They selected 48-year-old Bui Giang To, a commercial attach\u00e9 at the Embassy of Vietnam in Algeria.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Burgniard described To as \"the real foreigner on this plane\". She remembered that To was not intimidated by the hijackers and she believed that this attitude upset the hijackers. The Vietnamese diplomat thought he was about to be released because he was a foreigner; instead he was shot dead on the boarding stairs. Delhemme recalled that when the flight attendant next appeared with refreshments, she whispered to him that two passengers, not one, had died.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe French government wanted to bring French military personnel into Algeria to safely resolve the hijacking, but the Algerian government would not allow foreign military to land on Algerian soil to resolve an Algerian political crisis. Prime Minister Balladur said that he asked the Algerian government \"extremely forcefully and urgently\" to give permission for the aircraft to take off. He felt that the French government held responsibility for solving the problem as the aircraft belonged to a French airline and almost a third of the passengers were French.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nSeven hours into the hijacking, the cabin was calm but tense; at that point, few of the passengers knew that two people had been killed. It had grown dark outside and the aircraft was surrounded by spotlights. The pilots now attempted to defuse the situation by talking to the hijackers and trying to gain their trust. Delhemme explained that the beginning of a hijacking is violent, so the role of the pilot is to keep the participants calm, \"buy time\", show the hijackers who the crew are as people, and find out details about the hijackers; then the pilot has to try gaining the trust of the hijackers.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nDuring the night, Spanish authorities allowed the French military to send its forces to [[Majorca]], Spain, which was as close to Algeria as was possible without being accused of interfering in the situation.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> At 8:00&nbsp;pm, [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale]] (GIGN) operatives boarded an [[Airbus A300]] aircraft similar to F-GBEC, the hijacked plane, at a military base in France.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> En route to Majorca, the GIGN operatives were able to familiarise themselves with the A300 in preparation for storming the aircraft.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> After the GIGN's plane arrived at [[Palma de Mallorca Airport]], the Algerian government made it clear that French forces were not welcome in Algeria.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\n===25 December===\nCaptain Delhemme made a tour of the cabin at about 2:00 am the next morning to check on the situation; he said that the cabin was \"calm\" during that time. He noticed two of the hijackers asleep on the floor.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> In the morning, French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Balladur flew to Paris.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nNew information arrived at the [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] of France in [[Oran]], Algeria, via a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in the GIA: {{quote|We received this information directly from members of the Algerian secret service.

Over 170 people still remained on board the plane. The hijackers offered to release the remaining Algerian passengers, but the Algerians refused to leave the aircraft. Delhemme recalled that one passenger who was refusing to leave said that he thought the crew would be killed if he did, and Delhemme believes that the passengers' motives were sincere.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> By the end of 25 December, the hijackers had freed a total of 63 passengers.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Taylor625\">Taylor (2008), 6:25 minutes in.</ref>\n\nThe Algerian police used [[night vision]] devices to identify the lead hijacker, who was Abdul Abdullah Yahia.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The French government sent Yahia's mother to plead for him to release the passengers, in the hope that she could persuade her son to give in,<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> but the tactic backfired. One passenger, Kakachi, recalled Yahia becoming enraged by this move. At this point, the hijackers began targeting the French passengers; there were two staff members of the French Embassy in Algiers on board the flight, a secretary and a chef.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers forced the chef, Yannick Beugnet, to plead into the microphone. Through Beugnet, they demanded that unless the Algerian government cleared the A300 for takeoff before 9:30&nbsp;pm, they would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw him out of the door. The Algerian passengers assured him that the hijackers were bluffing while the French passengers were demanding that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the 9:30 deadline passed, the hijackers shot the chef and threw his body outside.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Nundy |title=Jet hijackers die as 170 are freed |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/jet-hijackers-die-as-170-are-freed-1390663.html |date=27 December 1994  |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, \"See what you get when you play tough?!\"<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The airline knew that the chef had been murdered as it was listening in on the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, said in an interview that the airline employees \"lived through [the event] with great emotion\". Zahida Kakachi recalled Lotfi calmly trying to convert her and another stewardess to [[Islam]], though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage him.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThe French government were informed of the events. Balladur spoke on the telephone to the [[Prime Minister of Algeria]], [[Mokdad Sifi]]; he told him that the French government would hold the Algerian government responsible for the outcome if it did not authorise them to intervene in the situation.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Just before midnight, Balladur told the [[President of Algeria]], [[Liamine Z\u00e9roual]], that France was ready to receive the Air France flight.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> As a result of Balladur's demands, 39 hours after the start of the hijacking, Z\u00e9roual allowed the aircraft to leave Algiers. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard recalled that everyone was relieved when the aircraft departed because they thought the crisis was over.\n\nThere was insufficient fuel on board the plane to reach Paris, because the [[auxiliary power unit]] had been running since the hijackers took over the plane, so a refuelling stop was scheduled at [[Marseille Provence Airport]]. Delhemme confronted Yahia to find out whether he planned to blow up the aircraft between Algiers and Marseille. Yahia insisted that the plane would fly to Marseille, take on fuel, then fly to Paris for the press conference; reassured, Delhemme prepared for takeoff. In an interview, Delhemme suggested that the hijackers would probably have said this anyway to prevent the crew from taking action against them. Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in the cockpit, seemed excited and \"like kids\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n===26 December===\nThe aircraft approached Marseille during the early hours of 26 December. The hijackers did not know that Major [[Denis Favier]]'s [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] squad was already in Marseille,<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> having flown from Majorca to a military base near Marseille, and planned to storm the aircraft while it was in Marseille. The GIGN squad practised entering the A300 before Flight 8969 arrived in Marseille.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Favier explained in an interview that the enemy was arriving in friendly territory, and the power difference would be a key element in the struggle.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The Flight 8969 aircraft landed at 3:33&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nSteward Claude Burgniard said that the hijackers felt that the landing in Marseille was a \"magic moment\" as they had arrived in France. Burgniard recalled that the airport was dark and that she only saw the lights of the A300 and a car that the A300 followed. The French authorities deliberately led the aircraft away from the terminal and into a remote corner of the airport. By 26 December, the French government had received information stating that the hijackers had planned to attack Paris. Favier planned to appear conciliatory and prolong the negotiations as long as possible. He believed that the hijackers were tired, so he planned to wear them down.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Alain Gehin, the Chief of Police of Marseille, spoke to the group of hijackers in the control tower. Gehin implemented Favier's strategy.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nWhile using Delhemme to speak for them,<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> the hijackers asked for 27 tonnes of fuel; the aircraft needed approximately 9 tonnes<!--9 from Mayday, 10 from TIME--> to fly to Paris from Marseille. The request indicated to the French authorities that the aircraft was going to be used as a firebomb or to fly the aircraft to an Islamic country sympathetic to the hijackers' cause. Hours later, the authorities received word of the firebomb plot. Passengers who were released in Algiers stated that the A300 had been rigged with explosives. Demolition experts determined that the plane was likely rigged in a way that would cause it to explode.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> [[Charles Pasqua]] said in an interview that the French government had decided that the aircraft was not going to leave Marseille, regardless of the consequences.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nAt around 8:00&nbsp;am, the hijackers demanded that the forces let the aircraft take off by 9:40&nbsp;am. The negotiators delayed the ultimatum by giving the aircraft additional food and water, emptying the toilet tanks, and providing vacuum cleaners. The GIGN operatives servicing the aircraft were disguised as airport personnel. They discovered the aircraft doors were not blocked or [[booby trap]]ped.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The men planted eavesdropping devices while others trained long-range \"cannon\" microphones on the A300's fuselage and windows.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Favier's group asked the hijackers if they would rather do a press conference in Marseille instead of Paris, since all of the major media outlets had bureaux in Marseille. The hijackers agreed to hold a press conference on the A300. The negotiators requested that the front of the aircraft be cleared for the press conference. This was to create an area for the GIGN during the storming of the aircraft. Favier explained in an interview that the press conference was an important tactic as it allowed the passengers to be moved to the rear of the aircraft. The hijackers did not realise that the doors of the A300 could be opened from the outside.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nTwelve hours after the A300 arrived at Marseille, the GIGN knew how many hijackers were on board and their location on the aircraft with the help of eavesdropping devices, infrared vision equipment, and \"cannon\" microphones.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> It intended to wait until sunset to take advantage of the darkness. The occupants of the aircraft were unaware of the GIGN's true motives, and the militants were confused about why the press had not yet arrived. Yahia, frustrated by the absence of the press and sensing the authorities were up to something, ordered the pilot to move the aircraft. Dellemme parked the aircraft at the foot of the [[airport control tower]] and in close proximity to the terminal and other aircraft. An explosion in this position would result in many more casualties than in the earlier, remote location.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nThis was a tactical disadvantage for the GIGN; the positions were based on the aircraft being parked where the French authorities ordered the placement of the A300. When the aircraft moved, the GIGN had to quickly reorganise its forces. Favier placed snipers on the roof so they would have a view of the cockpit. He organised a group of thirty men with three [[Ground support equipment#Passenger boarding steps/stairs|passenger boarding stairs]] to rush the aircraft and take it over. Favier planned to have two teams, each with 11 people, open the rear left and rear right doors of the A300. A third team of eight would open the front right door. The forces planned to isolate the cockpit, with Yahia, from the rest of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nBy 5:00&nbsp;pm, the authorities had not delivered any amount of fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected the youngest member of the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an [[atheist]]. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying \"I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.\"<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the [[Quran]] on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but \"nothing like what seemed to be about to happen\". Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n====Raid====\n\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Raid on Air France Flight 8969\n|date=26 December 1994\n|place=[[Marseille]], France\n|result=GIGN victory\n|combatant1={{flagicon|France}} [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]]\n|combatant2=[[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|GIA]]\n|commander1={{flagicon|France}} Major [[Denis Favier]]\n|commander2=Abdul Abdullah Yahia{{KIA}}\n|strength1=30 GIGN Operators\n|strength2=4 hijackers\n|casualties1=9 wounded\n|casualties2=4 killed\n|casualties3=3 passengers were already dead prior to the raid<br />\n13 passengers wounded<br />\n3 crew wounded\n}}\n\nOnce the hijackers noticed the [[airstair]]s moving towards them, they recognised the imminent assault. Through the cockpit window, a hijacker fired upon the airstair containing the forward GIGN team. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, it became apparent that it was elevated too high relative to the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Written without a source - we need to be sure it was a mistake if we're going to mention it}} After a short delay in repositioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers in the rear of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nFlight attendant Claude Burgniard described the firefight as \"the apocalypse\". Christophe Morin, a flight attendant, recalled that the GIGN ordered passengers and crew to get down as low as possible with their hands over their heads, hide, and then to not move. Morin described the situation as \"violent\". He recalled putting his overcoat over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands. Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in \"a rather bad spot\", so he crouched and made himself \"as small as possible\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nA few minutes after the beginning of the assault, most of the passengers had escaped. At that point, three of the four hijackers were fatally shot. Delhemme recalled that the cockpit only had himself, the flight engineer, and the last hijacker. Delhemme said that the hijacker could have killed him and his colleagues out of spite, but did not. In an interview, Denis Favier explained that there likely was a mutual recognition and \"respect\" between the hijackers and the hostages. He believes the bonds between the hijackers and hostages helped save lives of passengers and crew in the conflict.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nGIGN commando Philippe Bardelli was leading a column up the front right airstair, as that team was tasked with throwing stun grenades in the cockpit, when a 7.62 \u00d7 39&nbsp;mm bullet from an [[AK-47]] hit his drawn pistol and detonated the cartridges; Bardelli later remarked that his pistol which was hit saved his life since such AK-47 rounds were able to penetrate the GIGN's helmet visors.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBzxzyFhU2w</ref> The remaining hijacker kept the GIGN at bay for 20 minutes, but he eventually ran out of ammunition and died from a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, the GIGN operatives were not sure which men were the hijackers and how many were still alive, so they considered all male passengers as potentially being hijackers.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The flight engineer, Alain Bossuat, radioed the tower stating that the hijackers were dead and that there were no more left.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> This signaled to GIGN forces that a final clearing of the A300 could begin. Delhemme said that when the forces entered the aircraft, they ordered him to put his hands on his head. Delhemme said that, after the hijacking ordeal had run its course, he refused to leave with his hands on his head and be \"punished like a child\". Burgniard said that when she saw Bossuat handcuffed, the cabin crew told the forces to let him go as the individual was the flight engineer.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> At 5:35&nbsp;pm, Favier radioed to the tower that the incident was over; the incident unfolded in 54 hours.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nAll of the hijackers had been killed. The remaining passengers and crew survived the 20-minute gun battle.<sup id=\"fn_a_back\">[[#fn a|A]]</sup><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Of the remaining passengers, 13 received minor injuries.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/><ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Nine of the 30 GIGN operatives received injuries; of them, one received serious wounds.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Three crew members received injuries.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Delhemme was hit by bullets in his right elbow and thigh.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Bossuat received minor injuries; the dead bodies of two hijackers had shielded Delhemme and Bossuat from gunfire. Borderie, the most seriously injured, fractured his elbow and thigh from the 5-metre (16&nbsp;ft) drop.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Favier said that he determined that the operation was a success since none of the GIGN received fatal injuries. French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] said that the events unfolded \"exceptionally well\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs a result of the damage to the aircraft, the A300 was [[written off]].<ref name=\"ASN\"/> Several hours after the incident ended, the Armed Islamic Group, which had claimed responsibility for the event, killed four [[Roman Catholic]] priests in retaliation in [[Tizi-Ouzou]], Algeria. Three of the priests were French, while one was Belgian.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nThe crew of the A300 and the GIGN forces received high national honours. [[Charles Pasqua]], then the [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], said that throughout the ordeal the crew \"rose to the occasion\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Bernard Delhemme returned to flying and worked for Air France for nine years before retiring. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard said that she \"kept seeing the faces\" of the three passengers who had been executed; when she received her medal she realised that she had helped save 173 people; this allowed her to mourn and get over the incident. Burgniard said that she does not wear the medal, but that she felt like she deserved it. Burgniard, who also received a message of thanks from the airline, never again worked for Air France. Flight attendant Christophe Morin stopped working for Air France and began to work for a charitable organisation.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nA former militant group leader admitted that the men had planned to detonate the aircraft over the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The militant group never again attempted this plot. Pasqua said that if the militants crashed an aircraft on the Eiffel Tower or the [[Palais de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e|\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]], they would have committed what they would believe to be \"an extraordinary feat.\"<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nFlights between Algiers and Paris are now Flights 1555, 1855, 2155, and 2455 (operating to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] instead of Orly).<ref>[http://info.flightmapper.net/route/Air_France_AF_ALG_CDG Air France flights from Algiers to Charles De Gaulle, Paris.]</ref> Flight number 8969 is now a [[codeshare]] flight number for [[Delta Air Lines]] flight number 1584 between [[Greater Rochester International Airport]] and [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport]].<ref>[http://info.flightmapper.net/flight/Air_France_AF_8969 AF8969 schedule.

Captain Bernard Delhemme said that the hijackers, who had extensively planned the operation, did not anticipate that most of the passengers would be Algerians.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> The hijackers recited [[Quran]] verses and tried to reassure the Algerian passengers.

The negotiators said that Yahia spoke \"approximate\" French and always ended his sentences in \"[[Insha'Allah]]\" (\"God willing\").<ref name=\"Sancton\"/> Several passengers said all but one of the hijackers had no beards and closely cropped hair. A woman said that the men \"were polite and correct\" and that they \"had the determined air of cold-blooded killers\". Another passenger said the hijackers \"seemed excited, very euphoric\" and that they told the occupants that they would teach the French and the world a lesson and show what they were capable of doing.<ref name=\"Sancton\"/>\n\nAs the hijacking progressed, the passengers recognised the personalities of the hijackers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled that the crew and passengers gave nicknames to the hijackers \"to make things simpler\". Yahia, the leader, had given his name, so the passengers called him by that name. According to Burgniard, Lotfi had a \"peculiar\" character, \"was always on a knife edge\", and \"the most fanatic\" and \"the most fundamentalist\" of the hijackers. Therefore, he received the nickname \"Madman\" from the passengers. According to Burgniard, Lotfi was the hijacker who insisted that the passengers follow Islamic law. Lotfi found women having their heads uncovered \"intolerable\", making him very angry. One hijacker did not give his name to the passengers, so they called him \"Bill\". Burgniard stated that Bill was \"a little bit simple\" and \"more of a goatherd than a terrorist.\" She said his role as a hijacker was \"an error in casting\". Burgniard remembered that the occupants wondered why Bill was there and that they saw Bill appearing as if he wondered why he was there, as well. The hijacker nicknamed \"The Killer\" shot the hostages whom the hijackers had targeted.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The events of Flight 8969 were featured in \"The Killing Machine\", a [[List of Mayday episodes#Season 2 (2004)|Season 2 (2004)]] episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> (called ''Air Emergency'' and ''Air Disasters'' in the U.S. and ''Air Crash Investigation'' in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatisation was broadcast  with the title \"Hijacked\" in the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia; and in the United States as \"Hijack Rescue\". The episode uses a mix of re-enactments and actual footage. Flight 8969 captain Bernard Delhemme and Colonel Denis Favier, then a a major who was head of the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group|GIGN]] counter-terrorist unit assigned to the flight, gave their first television interviews for ''Mayday'', appearing in silhouette, as both felt under threat after the events and that members of the public believed that the militants were offering a reward for Favier's assassination. Eli Gemael, a Canadian actor of Jewish and Lebanese heritage, played lead hijacker Abdul Yahia.\n* The incident was also featured in an episode of the ''[[Zero Hour (2004 TV series)|Zero Hour]]'' television series called \"Shoot-Out in Marseille\". Using a mix of real footage and reenactment, it suggests that two of the terrorists were killed by the GIGN snipers.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mazurinas|first=Osmanas|title=Zero Hour Shoot Out in Marseilles|date=24 July 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBzxzyFhU2w}}</ref> Gemael reprises his role as Yahia for this dramatization.\n* A one-hour documentary, episode 3 of the UK [[BBC Two]] television series ''The Age of Terror'', was transmitted on 29 April 2008.
