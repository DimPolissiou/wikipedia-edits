Owing to a positive viewer reception, producer [[Louise Berridge]] turned Mickey into a regular character, and his on-screen family arrived a year later, including Mickey's little sister Demi, played by Swash's real sister, Shana. His son, Harry Swash, also appeared in the soap as his niece [[Summer Swann]] for a minimal period.

He made his final appearance in July 2008. Since the announcement of his departure, Swash has been critical of the direction producers took with his character.

The activities of a fifth column can be overt or clandestine. Forces gathered in secret can mobilize openly to assist an external attack. This term is also extended to organised actions by military personnel. Clandestine fifth column activities can involve acts of sabotage, disinformation, or espionage executed within defense lines by secret sympathizers with an external force.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] patrol on the streets of Madrid, 1936]]\n\nThe term \"fifth column\" originated in Spain (originally ''quinta columna'') during the early phase of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. It gained extreme popularity in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] media since early October 1936, and immediately started to make rounds also abroad.<ref>in French newspapers the term first appeared on October 4, 1936, one day after its first usage in the Madrid press, ''[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7634839j/f5.item.r=Cinqui%C3%A8me%20colonne.zoom La Passionaria preche la terreur]'', [in:] ''Le Journal'' 04.10.1936. In more distant countries like Poland the term started to appear since mid-October, see e.g. ''[https://polona.pl/item/dziennik-wilenski-r-20-nr-285-18-pazdziernika-1936,MTU3NDQwNDU/0/#info:metadata Oviedo ostatecznie uwolnione]'', [in:] ''Dziennik Wile\u0144ski'' 18.10.1936</ref> \n\nExact origins of the term are not clear. Its first identified appearance was in a secret telegram sent to [[Berlin]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charge d\u2019affaires]] in [[Alicante]], [[:de:Hans Hermann V\u00f6lckers|Hans-Hermann V\u00f6lckers]] dated September 30, 1936. He referred to an unidentified \"supposed statement by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\" which \"is being circulated\" (apparently in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] zone or in the Republican-held [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] zone). In the statement, Franco allegedly claimed that there were four [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] columns approaching Madrid and the fifth column waited to rise from the inside.<ref>Ruiz, Julius (2014), ''[https://books.google.es/books?id=HqBcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA185&dq=mola+fifth+column&hl=pl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-l43q3_7nAhVks4sKHU_ZB8YQ6AEIbjAH#v=onepage&q=mola%20fifth%20column&f=false The 'Red Terror' and the Spanish Civil War]'', Cambridge, {{ISBN|9781107054547}}, p. 187</ref> However, the telegram was part of the secret German diplomatic correspondence and was discovered long after the Civil War.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441 \u0418\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0443\u0440\u0438.JPG|thumb|[[Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri]]]]\n\nThe first public use of the term identified is in the October 3, 1936 issue of the Madrid [[Communist]] daily ''[[Mundo Obrero]]''.
