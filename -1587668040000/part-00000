Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\".

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water\u2014the \"deep vee\" hull, designed by Ray Hunt, found in approximately 75% of modern power boats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]].

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

It carried passenger traffic from the vicinity of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] to [[Wopsononock, Pennsylvania|Wopsononock]] and [[coal]] and [[timber]] from Wopsononock and [[Dougherty, Pennsylvania|Dougherty]] to Altoona.

However, Morris was unable to execute these plans. A group of [[New York City]] investors took over the railroad about 1916.{{sfn|Adams|1980|p=31}} They converted the railroad to standard gauge, operating initially with ex-Pennsylvania Railroad [[2-6-0]]s, but replacing them with [[Heisler locomotive|Heislers]] when the 2-6-0s were found to be unsuitable for the track.{{sfn|Adams|1980|p=32}}\n\nThe conversion failed to make the railroad pay, and the company went into receivership again on August 8, 1918.

Negotiations with the bondholders to resume service were not successful, and the rails were removed in 1921.{{sfn|Adams|1980|p=32}}\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Locomotives===\nThe Altoona & Wopsononock initially owned two engines. #1 was a [[National Locomotive Works|National]] {{whyte|2-6-0}}, and #2 a [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] {{whyte|4-4-0}}, both of which were purchased used from the [[Pittsburgh and Western Railroad]]. In 1892, the Altoona, Clearfield & Northern bought #3, a Baldwin {{whyte|4-6-0}}.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=46}} However, due to the depleted state of the railroad's finances, it was unable to pay for #3. Samuel Langdon forestalled legal proceedings by having the locomotive transferred to his United Collieries Co., which paid Baldwin in coal.{{sfn|Adams|1980|p=15}} Nothing is known of #4, if it ever existed. The Altoona & Beech Creek bought #5 and #6, both Baldwin {{whyte|2-6-0}}s, in 1901, while still under Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg & Eastern control. After the PJE&E lost its lease on the railroad, litigation ensued over the ownership of #3; by the time the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] declared in favor of the A&BC in 1903, United Collieries had sold it to the [[Surry, Sussex and Southampton Railroad]]. #5 and #6 were sold to the [[Ohio River and Western Railroad]] and the Tacajo Sugar Company, respectively, when the railroad was converted to standard gauge in 1916.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=46}}\n\nThe Altoona Northern initially purchased three ex-PRR {{whyte|2-6-0}}s (built at [[Juniata Shops]]), numbered #101\u2013103. They were found to be unsuitable for the light track and steep grades, and were sold in 1917. They were replaced by #104 and #105, new two-truck [[Heisler locomotive|Heislers]], and the railroad bought #106, a three-truck Heisler, in 1918. They were sold to various lumber companies when the railroad was abandoned.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=46}}\n\n===Passenger and freight equipment===\nDetails of the railroad's rolling stock are obscure. In 1891, it owned five passenger and three freight cars. In addition to the coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad had at least one [[parlor car]]<ref name=\"tttguide\" /> and several [[J. G. Brill Company|Brill]]-built [[observation car]]s. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service.{{sfn|Adams|1980|p=17}} Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of [[gondola (rail)|gondola]] cars for coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a standard gauge gondola fleet in the last years of its existence.{{sfn|Adams|1980|p=34}}\n\n==Stations==\nThe following stations existed along the line, going from south to north:<ref>1913 Timetable, published in the ''[[Altoona Tribune]]''</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Notes\n|-\n|Juniata || Across from PRR's [[Juniata Shops]]\n|-\n|Coleman ||\n|-\n|Ivyside || Site of an amusement park; now the [[Penn State Altoona]] campus\n|-\n|Gwin ||\n|-\n|Parks ||\n|-\n|Juniata Springs ||\n|-\n|Homer ||\n|-\n|Wopsononock || Site of the Wopsononock Hotel, a popular resort\n|-\n|Richland ||\n|-\n|Highland ||\n|-\n|Walker\n|-\n|Dougherty || Site of coal mines\n|}\n\nScenic points along the road included Mule Shoe Curve, the trestles and cut at Sandy Gap Bend, and the high bluffs along the right-of-way at Butcher Knife Point.<ref name=\"tttguide\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation | last=Adams | first=Richard D. | title=The Alley Popper | year=1980 | publisher=Richard D.

Davis became professional in 1991 but for many years was considered something of a journeyman; however, he vastly improved his game in the late 2000s, and as a result managed to get in the top 16 for the first time in 2012. The highlights of his career so far have been winning the [[Masters Qualifying Event|Benson & Hedges Championship]] in 2002 (earning him an appearance at the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]]), and the [[six-red snooker]] world championships three times (in [[2009 Six-red World Championship|2009]], [[2012 Six-red World Championship|2012]] and [[2013 Six-red World Championship|2013]]). Davis reached his first ranking event final in 2018, where he lost to [[Stuart Bingham]] in the final of the [[2018 English Open (snooker)|English Open]]. Prior to this he was widely considered to be the best player never to have reached a ranking final.\n\nDavis is the oldest snooker player to make an official [[maximum break]] of 147 points in a professional competition, at the age of 44 years and 202 days. He broke his own previous record of 44 years and 151 days, making his second maximum break 51 days after his first.\n\n== Career ==\nDavis made his debut in the main draw of the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994]], losing in the first round to [[Terry Griffiths]]. The [[1995 World Snooker Championship|following year]] he won his first match at the Crucible, beating [[Ken Doherty]] in the first round, before being knocked out by [[Peter Ebdon]] in the second round. Davis came close to losing his Main Tour status in the late 1990s, but recovered in the early 2000s to return to the top 48. Reaching the quarter-finals of the 2001 [[Regal Scottish]] tournament, his second career quarter-final, was the main catalyst for this. His success in reaching the 2008 World Championship came after 2 poor seasons, leaving him at No. 58 in the rankings. He opened the 2008/2009 season strongly by qualifying for the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]] and defeating local hope [[Joe Swail]] 5\u20134 in the first round, before beating [[Ding Junhui]] 5\u20134 in the last 32 in one of the best wins of his career.  He was beaten in the last 16 5\u20132 by [[Ali Carter]]. He followed this up by also qualifying for the [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain]] and [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|UK]] Championships, though he was forced to pull out early in his last-32 match against [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]] in the latter, due to a stomach upset.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/7781545.stm | title=O'Sullivan survives McLeod charge | date=13 December 2008 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=15 November 2018 }}</ref> He exceeded his 2007/2008 ranking points total after only five of the eight events of the 2008/2009 season.\nIn 2009 Davis won the [[2009 Six-red World Championship|Six-Red World Championship]].\nIn 2010, Davis reached the second round of the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] for the first time in 15 years by defeating sixth seed [[Ryan Day (snooker player)|Ryan Day]].\n\nDavis has compiled over 200 competitive centuries in his career up to October 2016, putting him 27th in the top of the players reaching a century of centuries in a career.\n\nHe got his career best tournament break of 143 in the [[2010 China Open (snooker)|China Open]] on 29 March 2010, the 93rd century of his career, in a wild-card round match against [[Tian Pengfei]].\nAfter an excellent 2009/2010 season, he reached the top 32 of the players and also claim his highest rank, by being ranked 26th.\n\nHe also qualified for the 2010 Shanghai Masters event where he reached the last-eight beating [[Marco Fu]] and [[Stephen Maguire]] on the way before surrendering a 4\u20131 lead against [[Jamie Burnett]] and going out 5\u20134.

Leonards-on-Sea|St. Leonards]] in Sussex, England. Davis became professional in 1991 but for many years was considered something of a journeyman; however, he vastly improved his game in the late 2000s, and as a result managed to get in the top 16 for the first time in 2012. The highlights of his career so far have been winning the [[Masters Qualifying Event|Benson & Hedges Championship]] in 2002 (earning him an appearance at the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]]), and the [[six-red snooker]] world championships three times (in [[2009 Six-red World Championship|2009]], [[2012 Six-red World Championship|2012]] and [[2013 Six-red World Championship|2013]]). Davis reached his first ranking event final in 2018, where he lost to [[Stuart Bingham]] in the final of the [[2018 English Open (snooker)|English Open]]. Prior to this he was widely considered to be the best player never to have reached a ranking final.\n\nDavis is the oldest snooker player to make an official [[maximum break]] of 147 points in a professional competition, at the age of 44 years and 202 days. He broke his own previous record of 44 years and 151 days, making his second maximum break 51 days after his first.\n\n== Career ==\nDavis made his debut in the main draw of the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994]], losing in the first round to [[Terry Griffiths]]. The [[1995 World Snooker Championship|following year]] he won his first match at the Crucible, beating [[Ken Doherty]] in the first round, before being knocked out by [[Peter Ebdon]] in the second round. Davis came close to losing his Main Tour status in the late 1990s, but recovered in the early 2000s to return to the top 48. Reaching the quarter-finals of the 2001 [[Regal Scottish]] tournament, his second career quarter-final, was the main catalyst for this. His success in reaching the 2008 World Championship came after 2 poor seasons, leaving him at No. 58 in the rankings. He opened the 2008/2009 season strongly by qualifying for the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy|Northern Ireland Trophy]] and defeating local hope [[Joe Swail]] 5\u20134 in the first round, before beating [[Ding Junhui]] 5\u20134 in the last 32 in one of the best wins of his career.  He was beaten in the last 16 5\u20132 by [[Ali Carter]]. He followed this up by also qualifying for the [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain]] and [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|UK]] Championships, though he was forced to pull out early in his last-32 match against [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]] in the latter, due to a stomach upset.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/7781545.stm | title=O'Sullivan survives McLeod charge | date=13 December 2008 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=15 November 2018 }}</ref> He exceeded his 2007/2008 ranking points total after only five of the eight events of the 2008/2009 season.\nIn 2009 Davis won the [[2009 Six-red World Championship|Six-Red World Championship]].\nIn 2010, Davis reached the second round of the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] for the first time in 15 years by defeating sixth seed [[Ryan Day (snooker player)|Ryan Day]].\n\nDavis has compiled over 200 competitive centuries in his career up to October 2016, putting him 27th in the top of the players reaching a century of centuries in a career.\n\nHe got his career best tournament break of 143 in the [[2010 China Open (snooker)|China Open]] on 29 March 2010, the 93rd century of his career, in a wild-card round match against [[Tian Pengfei]].\nAfter an excellent 2009/2010 season, he reached the top 32 of the players and also claim his highest rank, by being ranked 26th.\n\nHe also qualified for the 2010 Shanghai Masters event where he reached the last-eight beating [[Marco Fu]] and [[Stephen Maguire]] on the way before surrendering a 4\u20131 lead against [[Jamie Burnett]] and going out 5\u20134. However, his strong performances continued and took him to a career high ranking of 18.\n\n===2011/2012 season===\nDavis qualified for all but two of the ranking events in the [[Snooker season 2011/2012|2011/2012 season]].<ref name=\"2011/12\">{{cite web | url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?player=15&season=2011 | title=Mark Davis 2011/2012 | publisher=Snooker.org | accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> He could only advance beyond the first round in the [[2011 Australian Goldfields Open|Australian Goldfields Open]], where he lost 3\u20135 to [[Mark Selby]] in the last 16.<ref name=\"2011/12\"/> Davis played in all 12 of the minor-ranking [[Players Tour Championship 2011/2012|Players Tour Championship]] events during the season, reaching the final of [[Players Tour Championship 2011/2012 \u2013 Event 4|Event 4]], where he lost to Selby 0\u20134.

In 1974, she filed a $10 million lawsuit against [[Warner Bros.]], claiming that the running parody of her name (\"Hedley Lamarr\") featured in the [[Mel Brooks]] comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' infringed her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to Lamarr for \"almost using her name\". Brooks said that Lamarr \"never got the joke\".<ref name=\"DVD\">Interview: Mel Brooks. ''Blazing Saddles'' (DVD).

She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm. According to Marie Benedict's book ''The Only Woman In The Room,'' Kiesler's expression resulted from someone sticking her with a pin.

Situated in [[Southern Ontario]], it is a suburban city in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) and the seat of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]]. The city has a population of 593,638 as of the [[Canada 2016 Census]]. Brampton is Canada's [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|ninth-most populous municipality]], the [[List of North American cities by population|seventy-seventh largest city]] in [[North America]] and the third most populous city in the [[Greater Golden Horseshoe]] Region, behind [[Toronto]] and [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBrampton was incorporated as a village in 1853, with a population of 50 residents, taking its name from the market town of [[Brampton, Carlisle|Brampton]], in [[Cumbria]], England. In 1873, with 2,000 residents, Brampton was incorporated as a town. The city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title based on its large [[greenhouse]] industry. Today, Brampton's major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, [[retail]] administration, [[logistics]], [[information and communication technologies|information, and communication technologies]], food and beverage, [[life sciences]], and business services. Mass [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] notably from the [[Indian subcontinent]] has greatly increased Brampton's population \u2013 from 10,000 in the 1950s to over 600,000 today.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Haggert.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[John Haggert]], Brampton's first mayor]]\n\n{{main|History of Brampton}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Brampton|Brampton Fall Fair|Brampton Library}}\n\nPrior to the 1800s, all real business in [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]] took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile distant at the corner of Main and Queen streets, now the recognised centre of Brampton, William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building.  At the time, the area was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.<ref name=100years>\"Brampton's Beginning\" in ''Bramptons's 100th Anniversary as an Incorporated Town: 1873\u20131973'', Brampton: The Corporation of the Town of Brampton and the Brampton Centennial Committee, 1973, originally published in Ross Cumming, ed., ''Historical Atlas of Peel County'', n.p.: Walker and Miles, 1877.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel, and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern [[Brampton Fall Fair]].\n\nIn that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.<ref name=100years /> In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the [[Peel County Courthouse]] which was built in 1865-66; a three-storey County gaol was added at the rear in 1867.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from [[Dorking]], England, established a flower nursery in Brampton<ref name=\"nursery\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton's-History.aspx\n  | title = Discover Brampton's History\n  | publisher = City of Brampton\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032242/http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton%27s-History.aspx\n  | archivedate = 2010-02-21\n  }}</ref> shortly after his arrival in 1863.<ref name=\"bost\" /> Dale's Nursery became the town's largest<ref name=\"nursery\" /> and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,<ref name=\"bost\" /> and established a global export market for its products.<ref name=\"nursery\" /> The company [[chimney]] was a town landmark,<ref name=\"bost\" /> until [[Brampton City Council|Brampton Town Council]] allowed it to be torn down in 1977.<ref name=\"bost\" /> At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,<ref name=\"acresof\">{{cite book\n |url          = http://acresofglass.com/\n |title        = Acres of Glass: The Story of the Dale Estate and How Brampton Became \"The Flower Town of Canada\"\n |last         = O'Hara\n |first        = Dale\n |publisher    = Eastendbooks\n |date         = September 2007\n |isbn         = 978-1-896973-39-5\n |accessdate   = 2010-04-08\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619202006/http://www.acresofglass.com/\n |archive-date = 2009-06-19\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and was the largest [[Floriculture|cut flower]] business in North America,<ref name=\"floriculture\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | title = Brampton's FlowerTown Heritage\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123544/http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | archivedate = 2011-07-08\n  }}</ref> producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.<ref name=\"floriculture\" /> It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town.

In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nIn 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J.

After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Mayfield, Ontario|Mayfield]], were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in the United States.

Located in the former [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]], it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.'' The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and \"LEA\", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland.  He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]]. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of [[street name]]s. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\n===Region of Peel===\n[[File:pelbrm.PNG|thumb|right|Brampton in the Region of Peel]]\n[[File:Brampton City Hall.jpg|thumb|Brampton's City Hall]]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only [[Huttonville, Ontario|Huttonville]] and [[Churchville, Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Churchville]] still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality.  Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\n===Development as a city===\n[[File:Main Street Brampton.jpg|thumb|Main Street in downtown Brampton]] The early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], for example, is nearly completely urbanized.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.\n\n[[Carabram]] was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% Black.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0  |accessdate=March 7, 2019 }}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew exponentially to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the Black population grew to 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Census Profile, 2016 Census\nBrampton, Ontario and Peel, Regional municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate [[Georgetown Hospital|Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital]], [[Etobicoke General Hospital]], and [[Peel Memorial Hospital]] as the [[William Osler Health Centre]]. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada [[Communities in Bloom]] project.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBrampton has a total land area of {{convert|265|sqkm}}.

In 1873, with 2,000 residents, Brampton was incorporated as a town. The city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title based on its large [[greenhouse]] industry. Today, Brampton's major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, [[retail]] administration, [[logistics]], [[information and communication technologies|information, and communication technologies]], food and beverage, [[life sciences]], and business services. Mass [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] notably from the [[Indian subcontinent]] has greatly increased Brampton's population \u2013 from 10,000 in the 1950s to over 600,000 today.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Haggert.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[John Haggert]], Brampton's first mayor]]\n\n{{main|History of Brampton}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Brampton|Brampton Fall Fair|Brampton Library}}\n\nPrior to the 1800s, all real business in [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]] took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile distant at the corner of Main and Queen streets, now the recognised centre of Brampton, William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building.  At the time, the area was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.<ref name=100years>\"Brampton's Beginning\" in ''Bramptons's 100th Anniversary as an Incorporated Town: 1873\u20131973'', Brampton: The Corporation of the Town of Brampton and the Brampton Centennial Committee, 1973, originally published in Ross Cumming, ed., ''Historical Atlas of Peel County'', n.p.: Walker and Miles, 1877.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel, and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern [[Brampton Fall Fair]].\n\nIn that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.<ref name=100years /> In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the [[Peel County Courthouse]] which was built in 1865-66; a three-storey County gaol was added at the rear in 1867.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from [[Dorking]], England, established a flower nursery in Brampton<ref name=\"nursery\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton's-History.aspx\n  | title = Discover Brampton's History\n  | publisher = City of Brampton\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032242/http://www.brampton.ca/en/Arts-Culture-Tourism/heritage/Pages/Brampton%27s-History.aspx\n  | archivedate = 2010-02-21\n  }}</ref> shortly after his arrival in 1863.<ref name=\"bost\" /> Dale's Nursery became the town's largest<ref name=\"nursery\" /> and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,<ref name=\"bost\" /> and established a global export market for its products.<ref name=\"nursery\" /> The company [[chimney]] was a town landmark,<ref name=\"bost\" /> until [[Brampton City Council|Brampton Town Council]] allowed it to be torn down in 1977.<ref name=\"bost\" /> At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,<ref name=\"acresof\">{{cite book\n |url          = http://acresofglass.com/\n |title        = Acres of Glass: The Story of the Dale Estate and How Brampton Became \"The Flower Town of Canada\"\n |last         = O'Hara\n |first        = Dale\n |publisher    = Eastendbooks\n |date         = September 2007\n |isbn         = 978-1-896973-39-5\n |accessdate   = 2010-04-08\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619202006/http://www.acresofglass.com/\n |archive-date = 2009-06-19\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and was the largest [[Floriculture|cut flower]] business in North America,<ref name=\"floriculture\">{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | title = Brampton's FlowerTown Heritage\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-08\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123544/http://www.catchthespiritbrampton.com/flowertown.php\n  | archivedate = 2011-07-08\n  }}</ref> producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.<ref name=\"floriculture\" /> It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town.

In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nIn 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J.

After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Mayfield, Ontario|Mayfield]], were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in the United States.

Located in the former [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]], it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.'' The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and \"LEA\", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland.  He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]]. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of [[street name]]s. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\n===Region of Peel===\n[[File:pelbrm.PNG|thumb|right|Brampton in the Region of Peel]]\n[[File:Brampton City Hall.jpg|thumb|Brampton's City Hall]]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only [[Huttonville, Ontario|Huttonville]] and [[Churchville, Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Churchville]] still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality.  Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\n===Development as a city===\n[[File:Main Street Brampton.jpg|thumb|Main Street in downtown Brampton]] The early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], for example, is nearly completely urbanized.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.\n\n[[Carabram]] was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% Black.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0  |accessdate=March 7, 2019 }}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew exponentially to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the Black population grew to 14%.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Census Profile, 2016 Census\nBrampton, Ontario and Peel, Regional municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate [[Georgetown Hospital|Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital]], [[Etobicoke General Hospital]], and [[Peel Memorial Hospital]] as the [[William Osler Health Centre]]. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada [[Communities in Bloom]] project.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nBrampton has a total land area of {{convert|265|sqkm}}. The City of Brampton is bordered by Highway 50 ([[Vaughan]]) to the East, Winston Churchill Boulevard ([[Halton Hills]]) to the West, Mayfield Road ([[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]) to the north (except for a small neighbourhood, [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], which is part of Brampton despite extending somewhat north of Mayfield Road) and the [[hydro corridor]] ([[Mississauga]]) to the south except at Finch Avenue (at this point, Finch Avenue serves as the border between the two cities).\n\nBrampton features a [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') which is typical to much of [[Peel Region, Ontario|Peel Region]] and the rest of the Greater Toronto Area.\n\n{{Pearson Airport weatherbox}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = 30%;\n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = Brampton annexed Chinguacousy Township\u2014including the highly populated communities of Bramalea and Heart Lake\u2014in 1974.<br />The 2011 population count was revised in 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n|1858|50\n|1871|2090\n|1881|2920\n|1891|3252\n|1901|2748\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|3412\n|1921|4527\n|1931|5532\n|1941|5975\n|1951|8389\n|1961|18467\n|1971|41211\n|1981|149030\n|1991|234445\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|268251\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|325428\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|433806\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|523906\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|593638\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Visible minority and Aboriginal population ([[Canada 2016 Census]])\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Population group!!
