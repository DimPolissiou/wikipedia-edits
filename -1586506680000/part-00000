In most countries, \"police officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order.The Hong Kong policemen are called PoPo. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W.

The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. After being admitted, those who are now police officers must legally change their name to Jake. If the one admitted is a girl, they must change their name to Jessica. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $61,230 in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policetestguide.com/resources/police-officer-salary/ |title=Police Officer Salary \u2013 Police Test Guide &#124; Police Officer Test |publisher=Police Test Guide |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref>  In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]].

It was released in Western territories in summer 2016 with North American and European divisions of Bandai Namco Entertainment publishing the game on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:God Eater 2 PS Vita screenshot.jpg|thumbnail|left|The sample screenshot of the game for the PS Vita version]]\nIn comparison to ''Gods Eater Burst'', there are new features and additions such as the four new weapons, the Boost Hammer, Charge Spear, the Variant Scythe and the Shotgun. The Boost Hammer is a hammer fitted with a rocket booster. The Charge Spear is a large spear that can be \"charged\" to form a sharpened organic blade. The Variant Scythe is a large scythe that can extend for a long range. The Shotgun is a large cannon that sprays bullets, allowing increased damage the closer the player is to the opponent. Most of the existing weapons have additional features and skills, such as the Short Blade's upward slash that sends the character into mid-air, and the Long Blade's skill that can cancel attacks, thus allowing combos.\n\nThe Blood Arts, one of the new additions in the game, are \"attack add-on\" that augment normal attacks of all manner into stronger attacks, thus either unlocking new Blood Arts or converting existing ones into much stronger variants. Raising a Blood Art's proficiency requires completing missions. Finishing a mission with a higher rank gives more experience points to the currently equipped Blood Art and other Blood Arts of the same variant.\n\nPlayers can interact with various characters, who may invite them to optional side missions. Completing these give players materials, items, or even additional Blood Arts.\n\nUnlocked through Character Episodes, Link Support Devices allow players to gain status effects in battle, such as 10% additional attack power from two to five minutes into the mission. There's a limit of 100 points that can be used to equip them, with each Link Device consuming anywhere from 10 to 60 points.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place 3 years after ''[[God Eater (video game)|God Eater]]''. A new pandemic caused by \"Red Rain\" has struck the Far East Branch. Members of Special Forces \"Blood\", an affiliate of Fenrir who reside in a mobile base, known as \"Friar\", are sent to investigate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spencer|title=God Eater 2's Two New Transforming Weapons |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/09/29/god-eater-2s-two-new-transforming-weapons/|accessdate=2012-04-26|website=Siliconera}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 1 ===\n\nThe unnamed protagonist and Nana Kazuki are the newest God Eaters who have been found compatible with the 'P-66 Bias-Factor' and selected to join Blood, which was founded by Dr. Rachel Cladius and lead by captain Julius Visconti. After his first missions, the protagonist meets Romeo Leoni, Julius's friend who is also a Blood member, Dr. Leah Cladius, Rachel's older sister, Director Gregory de Gremslow, the base's Supreme Commander, and Yuno Ashihara, a talented singer. The Blood group is later joined by two more P-66 God Eaters: Ciel Alen\u00e7on, a master tactician from the same orphanage as Julius, and Gilbert \"Gil\" McLane, who is nicknamed \"Fragging Gil\" since his mentor Kate Lawry was K.I.A. five year ago. The Blood members lend aid to Fenrir's Far East Branch and work together with 'Cradle', a mobile emergency response and deployment station created after the incident at Aegis island. Each Blood member awakens their \"Blood Power\" through personal trials.\n\nAfter a mission, Gil reproves Romeo for his lackadaisical approach to combat. Romeo loses his temper, revealing he feels inadequate since his Blood Power has yet to awaken, and runs away. An old couple shelter him during a red rain storm. After the storm Aragami attack the village. Romeo calls his Blood group and defeats them. He apologizes for his recklessness. The incident awakens his Blood Power.\n\nA red rain storm hits Anagura. Romeo finds out that the old couple wasn't present in the quarantine zone and the radio from north gate is broken. He goes searching for them, with Julius backing him up. However, they run into a pack of Garm Aragami and are overwhelmed. With his last strength, Romeo finally activates his Blood Power to scare off the Aragami. Romeo is very happy that the old couple was saved by Julius before he dies in front of him.\n\nAfter Romeo's funeral, Julius resigns to help Dr. Rachel's God Arc Soldier project. God Arc Soldiers are unmanned [[mech]]s. Julius promotes the protagonist to Blood unit's new Captain with Ciel being promoted to Vice-Captain, and the Blood group is transferred to the Far East Branch. The Blood find a Marduk Aragami and kill it with God Arc Soldier help. Seeing the effectiveness of the God Arc Soldiers, the group understand why Julius refuses to return to Blood.\n\nResponding to a distress call, Blood finds a wounded Dr. Leah, who begs them for asylum at the Far East branch. After she receives treatment, Leah tells about her past with Rachel. When they were kids, Leah was angered by Rachel's icy personality and pushed her down a flight of stairs. Rachel went into a coma. Their father, Jepththat Cladius, resorted to injecting her with P73 Bias Factor to save her life, but Rachel remained crippled. Ever since, Rachel has quietly exploited Leah's guilt over her injury. Decades later, Jepththat confronted his daughters about their unethical experiments. They killed him with a prototype God Arc Soldier. Rachel is now using patients infected by the red rain for her experiments.\n\nRomeo's death was part of Rachel's plan to use a red rain infected Julius as the new Singularity to devour all life on the planet. Fenrir dispatches Blood Unit and Yuno to save red rain patients and find out their plan: perform a coup d'\u00e9tat in Friar to gain control over it. Yuno is infected while evacuating patients. They find she is to become a singularity alongside Julius. Blood's unit arrive in Friar and confront Rachel. However, the Apocalypse is now awakened with Julius inside of it. Rachel allows herself to be absorbed by it. Sakaki orders them to retreat.\n\nSakaki reveals the plan to stop the Apocalypse: since Yuno is another singularity, they can summon another Devouring Apocalypse to counter Julius'. With the protagonist's Blood Power and everyone around Fenrir singing Yuno's song, they succeed. They enter Julius's consciousness to talk to him one last time. Julius then stops it from evolving which results in an explosion that forms a helix-shaped plant-like structure. All the red rain patients are cured.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was first announced on September 15, 2011 during the annual gaming convention [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref>{{cite web|title=God Eater 2 in 2012 for Sony PSP |url=http://www.senpaigamer.com/sony-psp/god-eater-2-2012-sony-psp-09152011-1526 |publisher=Senpai Gamer |accessdate=2012-05-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503211506/http://senpaigamer.com/sony-psp/god-eater-2-2012-sony-psp-09152011-1526 |archivedate=2012-05-03 }}</ref> In September 2011, during a [[Famitsu]] [[interview]], Yusuke Tomizawa, producer of ''God Eater'', said \"''God Eater 2'' was to pinpoint what users found fun about the game; we're taking it apart and reassembling it from scratch.\"<ref name=consoleplayground/>\n\nA video trailer on ''God Eater 2'''s Japanese website shows that the game gives the option for PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita owners to play on a cooperative, multi-player mode with each other between platforms.

It was released in Western territories in summer 2016 with North American and European divisions of Bandai Namco Entertainment publishing the game on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:God Eater 2 PS Vita screenshot.jpg|thumbnail|left|The sample screenshot of the game for the PS Vita version]]\nIn comparison to ''Gods Eater Burst'', there are new features and additions such as the four new weapons, the Boost Hammer, Charge Spear, the Variant Scythe and the Shotgun. The Boost Hammer is a hammer fitted with a rocket booster. The Charge Spear is a large spear that can be \"charged\" to form a sharpened organic blade. The Variant Scythe is a large scythe that can extend for a long range. The Shotgun is a large cannon that sprays bullets, allowing increased damage the closer the player is to the opponent. Most of the existing weapons have additional features and skills, such as the Short Blade's upward slash that sends the character into mid-air, and the Long Blade's skill that can cancel attacks, thus allowing combos.\n\nThe Blood Arts, one of the new additions in the game, are \"attack add-on\" that augment normal attacks of all manner into stronger attacks, thus either unlocking new Blood Arts or converting existing ones into much stronger variants. Raising a Blood Art's proficiency requires completing missions. Finishing a mission with a higher rank gives more experience points to the currently equipped Blood Art and other Blood Arts of the same variant.\n\nPlayers can interact with various characters, who may invite them to optional side missions. Completing these give players materials, items, or even additional Blood Arts.\n\nUnlocked through Character Episodes, Link Support Devices allow players to gain status effects in battle, such as 10% additional attack power from two to five minutes into the mission. There's a limit of 100 points that can be used to equip them, with each Link Device consuming anywhere from 10 to 60 points.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place 3 years after ''[[God Eater (video game)|God Eater]]''. A new pandemic caused by \"Red Rain\" has struck the Far East Branch. Members of Special Forces \"Blood\", an affiliate of Fenrir who reside in a mobile base, known as \"Friar\", are sent to investigate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spencer|title=God Eater 2's Two New Transforming Weapons |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/09/29/god-eater-2s-two-new-transforming-weapons/|accessdate=2012-04-26|website=Siliconera}}</ref>\n\n=== Part 1 ===\n\nThe unnamed protagonist and Nana Kazuki are the newest God Eaters who have been found compatible with the 'P-66 Bias-Factor' and selected to join Blood, which was founded by Dr. Rachel Cladius and lead by captain Julius Visconti. After his first missions, the protagonist meets Romeo Leoni, Julius's friend who is also a Blood member, Dr. Leah Cladius, Rachel's older sister, Director Gregory de Gremslow, the base's Supreme Commander, and Yuno Ashihara, a talented singer. The Blood group is later joined by two more P-66 God Eaters: Ciel Alen\u00e7on, a master tactician from the same orphanage as Julius, and Gilbert \"Gil\" McLane, who is nicknamed \"Fragging Gil\" since his mentor Kate Lawry was K.I.A. five year ago. The Blood members lend aid to Fenrir's Far East Branch and work together with 'Cradle', a mobile emergency response and deployment station created after the incident at Aegis island. Each Blood member awakens their \"Blood Power\" through personal trials.\n\nAfter a mission, Gil reproves Romeo for his lackadaisical approach to combat. Romeo loses his temper, revealing he feels inadequate since his Blood Power has yet to awaken, and runs away. An old couple shelter him during a red rain storm. After the storm Aragami attack the village. Romeo calls his Blood group and defeats them. He apologizes for his recklessness. The incident awakens his Blood Power.\n\nA red rain storm hits Anagura. Romeo finds out that the old couple wasn't present in the quarantine zone and the radio from north gate is broken. He goes searching for them, with Julius backing him up. However, they run into a pack of Garm Aragami and are overwhelmed. With his last strength, Romeo finally activates his Blood Power to scare off the Aragami. Romeo is very happy that the old couple was saved by Julius before he dies in front of him.\n\nAfter Romeo's funeral, Julius resigns to help Dr. Rachel's God Arc Soldier project. God Arc Soldiers are unmanned [[mech]]s. Julius promotes the protagonist to Blood unit's new Captain with Ciel being promoted to Vice-Captain, and the Blood group is transferred to the Far East Branch. The Blood find a Marduk Aragami and kill it with God Arc Soldier help. Seeing the effectiveness of the God Arc Soldiers, the group understand why Julius refuses to return to Blood.\n\nResponding to a distress call, Blood finds a wounded Dr. Leah, who begs them for asylum at the Far East branch. After she receives treatment, Leah tells about her past with Rachel. When they were kids, Leah was angered by Rachel's icy personality and pushed her down a flight of stairs. Rachel went into a coma. Their father, Jepththat Cladius, resorted to injecting her with P73 Bias Factor to save her life, but Rachel remained crippled. Ever since, Rachel has quietly exploited Leah's guilt over her injury. Decades later, Jepththat confronted his daughters about their unethical experiments. They killed him with a prototype God Arc Soldier. Rachel is now using patients infected by the red rain for her experiments.\n\nRomeo's death was part of Rachel's plan to use a red rain infected Julius as the new Singularity to devour all life on the planet. Fenrir dispatches Blood Unit and Yuno to save red rain patients and find out their plan: perform a coup d'\u00e9tat in Friar to gain control over it. Yuno is infected while evacuating patients. They find she is to become a singularity alongside Julius. Blood's unit arrive in Friar and confront Rachel. However, the Apocalypse is now awakened with Julius inside of it. Rachel allows herself to be absorbed by it. Sakaki orders them to retreat.\n\nSakaki reveals the plan to stop the Apocalypse: since Yuno is another singularity, they can summon another Devouring Apocalypse to counter Julius'.

Wary of others muscling in on their patch, Andy and Lance decide to keep their operations secret, but Sophie seems to know more than she should.

Time lapse shows all but the decorated gold handle of the stick decaying, and the shot pans upwards to reveal Andy and Lance walking across the field in present-day Danebury, detecting as they go. Having had no success they decide to look up the hill. The jewel is shown again, still buried, at the beginning of subsequent episodes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Episode 1\n| RTitle          = <ref>{{BBC episode|id=b06l11tj|episode=''Detectorists'', Series 2, Episode 1}}</ref>\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|df=yes|2015|10|29}}\n| ShortSummary    = Baby Stan has arrived, Andy has qualified as an archaeologist but has no work, and Becky is off with Gay Martin, talking about [[Voluntary Service Overseas|VSO]]. A young German man, Peter, turns up at a meeting of the DMDC, telling them he is looking for the wreckage of a [[Junkers]] World War II bomber. His grandfather was one of the crew members when it crashed somewhere nearby in 1941. Sophie offers to help him research the location of the crash site. Andy and the other members of the DMDC, worried that Lance is becoming lonely, try to convince him to try internet dating.

Meanwhile Becky's patience with the petty politics at her school is at breaking point and she walks out of a staff meeting. Andy spots Lance in a cafe with the mystery woman, who is much younger than he is. Danebury's mayor seeks the DMDC's help finding his [[chain of office]] which he has lost at a [[dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]] site.

It transpires that the crash site is on the Mayor's land, leading Terry to suggest that the club should ask for permission to search his land as a reward for finding the chain. Becky tries to convince Andy to consider volunteering abroad; she has found an archaeological dig in Botswana and set him up for an interview.

Andy's interview goes disastrously at first, but his enthusiasm for archaeology shows when he presents some clay pipe pieces he found in a flower-bed. Terry receives the licence from the MOD to excavate the crash site, which reveals there were no crewmen on board when the plane crashed.

The State Recovery Committee, comprising representatives of government agencies and relief organisations, met urgently on 12 January to coordinate prompt agency responses. Personal hardship and distress grants were provided as a priority, including a State Government grant of $10,000 to all farmers affected by the fire to assist with immediate needs; [[Centrelink]] payments were prioritised; a hotline service was set up on 12 January, receiving more than 2900 calls in 15 weeks; and extensive measures such as providing shipping containers for storage of salvaged possession were speedily put in place.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dcsi.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/34595/2005-Eyre-Peninsula-Bushfire-Report-Collaboration-is-the-Key-Report.pdf |title= Collaboration is the key: Lessons from the South Australian Government\u2019s recovery operation, Lower Eyre Peninsula bushfire January 2005|website= Department for Communities and Social Inclusion|author= [South Australian] State Recovery Committee|date= September 2005 |access-date= 30 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"AIDR\"/>\n\nDonations of goods flooded in, and an Army detachment and people from across Australia joined local people to help with the clean-up \u2014 discovering among the devastation such objects as melted headlight glass and aluminium \u2014 and undertaking recovery tasks such as re-fencing.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Not stated-->|title=Black Tuesday: 10 years on \u2014 Gallery|url=http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/2803003/black-tuesday-10-years-on-gallery/#slide=32|website=Port Lincoln Times|date=11 January 2015|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nTen years later, on Sunday 11 January 2015, about 200 people packed into the Marble Range Football Club, Wangary, for a 10th anniversary memorial service. State member of parliament for the region, Peter Treloar, who in 2005 was a farmer, said \"Many people's lives changed for ever that day\"; but he said he understood that not all wanted to be involved in the commemoration. \"It's not going to be a day for everyone. I've spoken to some people who did not want to attend.\" Memorial organiser Benji Callen said people were still healing from the bushfire and attended the memorial with mixed feelings. Among people who had been in the fire who spoke with reporters from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] was Lorna Harding, aged 91, who was among those who took refuge in the sea off North Shields. She had watched as the house she was born in and had lived in all her life was destroyed. \"It just came so fast. Before we knew where we were, we were covered in smoke. But we had the sea to go into so we were right.\" <ref name=\"ABC News\"/>\n\n== Coronial inquest ==\n\nBetween 5 October 2005 and 8 May 2007, South Australia's Deputy State Coroner conducted a coronial inquest that examined a large range of factors connected with the bushfire, taking evidence from 140 witnesses. In his 703-page report released on 18 December 2007, the coroner made 34 wide-ranging recommendations for minimising future bushfire risks,{{sfn|Inquest|2007|pp=579\u2013585 (PDF file p. 664\u2013670)}} to which the South Australian Government subsequently responded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/media/1567/south_australian_government_response_to_wangary_bushfire_recommendations.pdf|title=Government response to the Deputy Coroner\u2019s recommendations from the Wangary Coronial Inquest\n|website= Australian Disaster Resilience Knowledge Hub|author= Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience|access-date=13 September 2017}}</ref> The report also listed other investigations into the bushfire.{{sfn|Inquest|2007|pp=573\u2013575 (PDF file p. 657\u2013659)}}\n\nAn Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program broadcast on the day on which the coronial findings were released stated that \"The report details a series of miscalculations and miscommunications among firefighters on the ground and their [[South Australian Country Fire Service|CFS]] senior officers in Adelaide that resulted in resources being denied until the fire was out of control. According to the Deputy Coroner, miscommunications between senior CFS officers left them unaware how seriously the fire was growing. As a result, critical decisions were delayed.<ref name=\"7.30 Report\"/> ... There are those critical of the coronial process, arguing it does little to prevent a future bushfire ... civil action is likely to be launched immediately against the CFS and the owner of the vehicle which started the fire by 70 litigants, mostly farmers.\"<ref name=\"7.30 Report\"/>\n\nA great deal of evidence was given to the inquest about the crucial question of the firefighting and fire suppression strategies that could and/or should have been adopted on the Monday night and the Tuesday morning, but were not. The main focus of activity overnight, attracting much of the available resources, had been on an area of sugar gum trees. The coroner considered it was an unwanted distraction to CFS appliances that might otherwise have been available to work elsewhere. Only a very limited amount of suppression work was undertaken on the eastern or western sides of a paperbark swamp, or in the swamp, where there was significant fire activity. As a result, fire was able to escape from that part of the swamp with no resources there to prevent it or reduce its impact. The coroner queried whether the fatal outcome would have occurred if the fire\u2019s impact had even been reduced slightly.{{sfn|Inquest|2008|pp=443, 445 (PDF file pp. 60, 62)}}\n\nThe Deputy State Coroner had referred in the coronial report to the \"very strident\" public criticism of volunteer Incident Management Teams that had occurred. However, his concluding remarks were: \"The CFS have effected much change since this incident. Recommendations made in two separate inquiries \u2014 namely Project Phoenix and the inquiry conducted by Dr Bob Smith \u2014 have been, or are being, implemented. In addition, a number of initiatives have been implemented that have resulted in more effective and timely communication in incident settings. The implementation of change is to be applauded.

Compared to the standard muffler that would normally be fitted to a vehicle of that type, the non-standard after-market muffler had a lesser capacity to inhibit the passage of hot carbonaceous particles through it.\"{{sfn| Inquest,|2007|pp=I, II (PDF file p. 59)}} \n\nAfter the fire was detected, people went to the scene, including farmers in their farm firefighting appliances who had seen the smoke from a distance. [[South Australian Country Fire Service|Country Fire Service]] (CFS) appliances and their volunteer crews were also dispatched to the location. It quickly became obvious that sourcing water in this area was a problem; the fire proved difficult to quell under the influence of a strong breeze. Valiant efforts were made to contain the fire during the course of the afternoon, and more CFS appliances arrived.{{sfn| Inquest,|2008|p=II (PDF file p. 60)}} By the evening, the fireground covered {{convert|1800|ha}} with a south-eastern flank of several kilometres.{{sfn| Inquest,|2008|p=IX (PDF file p. 67)}}\n\n[[File:Backburn at Duck Lake Road -- Eyre Peninsula bushfire 2005.jpg|thumb|250 px|Backburning on the night of 10 January 2005 at Duck Lake Road, Edillilie, to ameliorate the Eyre Peninsula bushfire]]\n\n[[File:South Australian Country Fire Service truck and Wangary bushfire, 2005.jpg|thumb|250 px|A South Australian Country Fire Service fire-fighting truck, one of many deployed against the January 2005 Eyre Peninsula bushfires.]]\n\nMeasures to counter the fire included fire suppression, blacking out, burning out, backburning, and earthmoving.

As the flames bore down on the caravan park, panicked residents escaped to the ocean.\" One man, who had escaped to the beach, said \"It's the worst place for it to come, actually, because there's nowhere to run. That's why a lot of the people here ended up in the water. I rescued a man out of a boat that got washed out to sea with the wind yesterday. They jumped off the cliffs when the fire came.

A bushfire recovery centre was set up at Port Lincoln High School and [[Cummins, South Australia|Cummins]] Bowling Club. The State Recovery Committee, comprising representatives of government agencies and relief organisations, met urgently on 12 January to coordinate prompt agency responses. Personal hardship and distress grants were provided as a priority, including a State Government grant of $10,000 to all farmers affected by the fire to assist with immediate needs; [[Centrelink]] payments were prioritised; a hotline service was set up on 12 January, receiving more than 2900 calls in 15 weeks; and extensive measures such as providing shipping containers for storage of salvaged possession were speedily put in place.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dcsi.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/34595/2005-Eyre-Peninsula-Bushfire-Report-Collaboration-is-the-Key-Report.pdf |title= Collaboration is the key: Lessons from the South Australian Government\u2019s recovery operation, Lower Eyre Peninsula bushfire January 2005|website= Department for Communities and Social Inclusion|author= [South Australian] State Recovery Committee|date= September 2005 |access-date= 30 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"AIDR\"/> \n\nDonations of goods flooded in, and an Army detachment and people from across Australia joined local people to help with the clean-up \u2014 discovering among the devastation such objects as melted headlight glass and aluminium \u2014 and undertaking recovery tasks such as re-fencing.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Not stated-->|title=Black Tuesday: 10 years on \u2014 Gallery|url=http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/2803003/black-tuesday-10-years-on-gallery/#slide=32|website=Port Lincoln Times|date=11 January 2015|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nTen years later, on Sunday 11 January 2015, about 200 people packed into the Marble Range Football Club, Wangary, for a 10th anniversary memorial service. State member of parliament for the region, Peter Treloar, who in 2005 was a farmer, said \"Many people's lives changed for ever that day\"; but he said he understood that not all wanted to be involved in the commemoration. \"It's not going to be a day for everyone. I've spoken to some people who did not want to attend.\" Memorial organiser Benji Callen said people were still healing from the bushfire and attended the memorial with mixed feelings. Among people who had been in the fire who spoke with reporters from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] was Lorna Harding, aged 91, who was among those who took refuge in the sea off North Shields. She had watched as the house she was born in and had lived in all her life was destroyed. \"It just came so fast. Before we knew where we were, we were covered in smoke. But we had the sea to go into so we were right.\" <ref name=\"ABC News\"/>\n\n== Coronial inquest ==\n\nBetween 5 October 2005 and 8 May 2007, South Australia's Deputy State Coroner conducted a coronial inquest that examined a large range of factors connected with the bushfire, taking evidence from 140 witnesses. In his 703-page report released on 18 December 2007, the coroner made 34 wide-ranging recommendations for minimising future bushfire risks,{{sfn| Inquest,|2007|pp=579\u2013585 (PDF file p. 664\u2013670)}} to which the South Australian Government subsequently responded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/media/1567/south_australian_government_response_to_wangary_bushfire_recommendations.pdf|title=Government response to the Deputy Coroner\u2019s recommendations from the Wangary Coronial Inquest\n|website= Australian Disaster Resilience Knowledge Hub|author= Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience|access-date=13 September 2017}}</ref> The report also listed other investigations into the bushfire.{{sfn| Inquest,|2007|pp=573\u2013575 (PDF file p. 657\u2013659)}}\n\nAn Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program broadcast on the day on which the coronial findings were released stated that \"The report details a series of miscalculations and miscommunications among firefighters on the ground and their [[South Australian Country Fire Service|CFS]] senior officers in Adelaide that resulted in resources being denied until the fire was out of control. According to the Deputy Coroner, miscommunications between senior CFS officers left them unaware how seriously the fire was growing. As a result, critical decisions were delayed.<ref name=\"7.30 Report\"/> ... There are those critical of the coronial process, arguing it does little to prevent a future bushfire ... civil action is likely to be launched immediately against the CFS and the owner of the vehicle which started the fire by 70 litigants, mostly farmers.\"<ref name=\"7.30 Report\"/> \n\nA great deal of evidence was given to the inquest about the crucial question of the firefighting and fire suppression strategies that could and/or should have been adopted on the Monday night and the Tuesday morning, but were not. The main focus of activity overnight, attracting much of the available resources, had been on an area of sugar gum trees. The coroner considered it was an unwanted distraction to CFS appliances that might otherwise have been available to work elsewhere. Only a very limited amount of suppression work was undertaken on the eastern or western sides of a paperbark swamp, or in the swamp, where there was significant fire activity. As a result, fire was able to escape from that part of the swamp with no resources there to prevent it or reduce its impact. The coroner queried whether the fatal outcome would have occurred if the fire\u2019s impact had even been reduced slightly.{{sfn| Inquest,|2008|pp=443, 445 (PDF file pp. 60, 62)}}\n\nThe Deputy State Coroner had referred in the coronial report to the \"very strident\" public criticism of volunteer Incident Management Teams that had occurred. However, his concluding remarks were: \"The CFS have effected much change since this incident. Recommendations made in two separate inquiries \u2014 namely Project Phoenix and the inquiry conducted by Dr Bob Smith \u2014 have been, or are being, implemented. In addition, a number of initiatives have been implemented that have resulted in more effective and timely communication in incident settings. The implementation of change is to be applauded. The response of the Country Fire Service to this incident and that of its Chief Officer, Mr Euan Ferguson, has, in my view, been exemplary.\"{{sfn| Inquest,|2007|p=XIV (PDF file p. 72)}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External link==\n{{commons category}}\n\n{{Bushfires in Australia}}\n\n\n[[Category:Disasters in South Australia]]\n[[Category:2005 in Australia]]\n[[Category:2005 wildfires]]\n[[Category:Bushfires in South Australia]]\n[[Category:South Australian Country Fire Service]]\n[[Category:2000s in South Australia]]\n[[Category:Eyre Peninsula]]\n[[Category:January 2005 events in Oceania]]\n", "name_user": "Headbomb", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: {{sfn| Inquest, \u2192 {{sfn|Inquest (15)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula_bushfire,_2005"}
