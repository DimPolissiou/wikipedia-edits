The curve had a [[Slow zone#Speed restrictions in the United Kingdom|maximum permitted speed]] of {{convert|30|mph|kph}}, but the express had been travelling at more than {{convert|70|mph|kph}}.  The train was completely [[derail]]ed, and smashed into a [[milk train]] and a light engine, killing 28 people.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe accident occurred at the same time as a short cut of the rival [[Great Western Railway]] was opening, and it was claimed that the driver of the crashed train was trying to show that his railway was capable of competitive speeds.  It was also rumoured that passengers \u2013 mostly rich [[New York City|New Yorkers]] travelling to London from the transatlantic port at Plymouth \u2013 had bribed the driver to run the train as fast as possible, but there was not any evidence of this, and if anything the train had lost time earlier.  Conversely, it was stated that drivers often ran through Salisbury very fast on these trains to \"get a run\" at the following hill.  The engine was a new [[LSWR L12 class]] 4-4-0 with a higher [[centre of gravity]] than the earlier [[LSWR T9 class|T9 class]].  The most likely cause of the accident is that the driver simply did not realise the level of risk he was running, particularly as this was the first occasion on which he had taken a non-stopping train through Salisbury.  Also, [[steam locomotives]] at this time, and for half a century afterwards, were not fitted with [[speedometer]]s.\n\nAs a result of the crash, all trains were required to stop at Salisbury station from that point onwards (the boat train at the time had no passenger stops from Plymouth to London Waterloo, although locomotives were changed at [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railway Disasters |publisher=Ian Allan Ltd. |year=1996}}</ref> The speed limit on the curve east of Salisbury was also reduced to {{convert|15|mph|kph}}, a limit still in effect today.\n\nThere is a memorial tablet to the 28 dead (including the driver, two firemen and the guard) in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nThe accident was the second in a series of three derailments due to excessive speed at night in a 16-month period. The others were at [[Grantham rail accident|Grantham]] 1906 and [[Shrewsbury rail accident|Shrewsbury]] 1907. All three resulted in deaths, including the footplate crews; the cause in each case was recorded as Driver Error but there has been much speculation since.\n\nIn 2006, historian Frogg Moody organised a memorial service at Salisbury Railway Station.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lists of rail accidents]]\n* [[List of British rail accidents]]\n\n=== Similar accidents ===\n*  [[Amagasaki rail crash]] \u2013 2005 \u2013 Overspeed through sharp curve.\n*  [[Santiago de Compostela derailment]] \u2013 2013\n*  [[Eckwersheim derailment]] \u2013 2015 \n*  [[Rail accidents at Morpeth|Morpeth Railway Station]] \u2013 1969,1984,1994 \u2013 three occasions, overspeed through sharp curve.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | first=J.A.B. | last=Hamilton. | title=British Railway Accidents of the 20th Century (reprinted as Tracks to Disaster). }}\n* {{cite book | first=O.S. | last=Nock |authorlink=O.

It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election and one Assembly Member by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\n== History ==\nThe constituency is located in the preserved county of [[West Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].  It consists of the electoral wards of: [[Aberdulais]], [[Alltwen|Allt-wen]], [[Blaengwrach]], [[Bryncoch North|Bryn-c\u00f4ch North]], [[Bryncoch South|Bryn-c\u00f4ch South]], [[Cadoxton (electoral ward)|Cadoxton]], [[Cimla]], [[Crynant]], [[Cwmllynfell]], [[Dyffryn Clydach|Dyffryn]], [[Glynneath (electoral ward)|Glynneath]], [[Godre'r Graig]], [[Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen (electoral ward)|Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen]], [[Lower Brynamman]], [[Neath East]], [[Neath North]], [[Neath South]], [[Onllwyn]], [[Pelenna]], [[Pontardawe]], [[Resolven]], [[Rhos, Neath Port Talbot|Rhos]], [[Seven Sisters (electoral ward)|Seven Sisters]], [[Tonna, Neath|Tonna]], [[Trebanos (electoral ward)|Trebanos]], [[Ystalyfera]].\n\nThe Neath constituency is a mixture of both industrial and rural communities, running in a north-south strip along the dips, ridges and folded landscape of [[South Wales]]. It includes most of the Neath and Dulais valleys, and some of the Upper Swansea Valley as well. The town of [[Neath]] is at its southern end and is a medium-sized town which started life as a Roman Nidum.\n\nThe constituency boasts historical places of both industrial and natural forms. Neath and the surrounding areas were industrialised very early in Britain's history. Copper smelting was already happening here in the late sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWhen [[Neath Abbey]] (now a magnificent ruin) was founded in 1129, it was the richest of all Welsh monasteries, and in writings of the sixteenth century was described as the 'fairest Abbey of all Wales'. At its height it owned extensive lands and property, from Glamorgan to Somerset; had almost 5,000 sheep, as well as horses and cattle; it owned a ship and a landing-place, and worked mills, fisheries and coal-mines. But it suffered greatly during the many skirmishes between the Welsh and English (or Normans), and by the 1530s had only eight monks left. The ruins date mostly from the late thirteenth century. It has been in turn, a prosperous Abbey, a Jacobean Mansion (painted by Turner), an iron foundry (which explains the Abbey's position in the middle of an industrial area) and now an historical monument.\n\nThe constituency was heavily mined and the small communities that grew up around these mines were devastated by the collapse of the mining industry in the 1980s. On the edges of many of these communities there are now \"Industrial Villages\" springing up, helping to replace the jobs lost by the demise of the mining industry, and so helping to keep young people in these communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npt.gov.uk/|title=Neath Port Talbot Council|website=www.npt.gov.uk}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2011}}\n\nA legacy to Neath's political history is the memorial stone in Victoria Gardens to the 5 Neath citizens killed during the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u201338.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe constituency remains a [[Welsh language|Welsh-speaking]] area, with approximately 26% of the population reported as Welsh speakers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|n|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Coalition Liberal/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[John Hugh Edwards]]\n| [[Coalition Liberal]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n| [[William Jenkins (Labour politician)|Sir William Jenkins]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 Neath by-election|1945 by-election]]\n| [[D.

It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election and one Assembly Member by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\n== History ==\nThe constituency is located in the preserved county of [[West Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].  It consists of the electoral wards of: [[Aberdulais]], [[Alltwen|Allt-wen]], [[Blaengwrach]], [[Bryncoch North|Bryn-c\u00f4ch North]], [[Bryncoch South|Bryn-c\u00f4ch South]], [[Cadoxton (electoral ward)|Cadoxton]], [[Cimla]], [[Crynant]], [[Cwmllynfell]], [[Dyffryn Clydach|Dyffryn]], [[Glynneath (electoral ward)|Glynneath]], [[Godre'r Graig]], [[Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen (electoral ward)|Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen]], [[Lower Brynamman]], [[Neath East]], [[Neath North]], [[Neath South]], [[Onllwyn]], [[Pelenna]], [[Pontardawe]], [[Resolven]], [[Rhos, Neath Port Talbot|Rhos]], [[Seven Sisters (electoral ward)|Seven Sisters]], [[Tonna, Neath|Tonna]], [[Trebanos (electoral ward)|Trebanos]], [[Ystalyfera]].\n\nThe Neath constituency is a mixture of both industrial and rural communities, running in a north-south strip along the dips, ridges and folded landscape of [[South Wales]]. It includes most of the Neath and Dulais valleys, and some of the Upper Swansea Valley as well. The town of [[Neath]] is at its southern end and is a medium-sized town which started life as a Roman Nidum.\n\nThe constituency boasts historical places of both industrial and natural forms. Neath and the surrounding areas were industrialised very early in Britain's history. Copper smelting was already happening here in the late sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWhen [[Neath Abbey]] (now a magnificent ruin) was founded in 1129, it was the richest of all Welsh monasteries, and in writings of the sixteenth century was described as the 'fairest Abbey of all Wales'. At its height it owned extensive lands and property, from Glamorgan to Somerset; had almost 5,000 sheep, as well as horses and cattle; it owned a ship and a landing-place, and worked mills, fisheries and coal-mines. But it suffered greatly during the many skirmishes between the Welsh and English (or Normans), and by the 1530s had only eight monks left. The ruins date mostly from the late thirteenth century. It has been in turn, a prosperous Abbey, a Jacobean Mansion (painted by Turner), an iron foundry (which explains the Abbey's position in the middle of an industrial area) and now an historical monument.\n\nThe constituency was heavily mined and the small communities that grew up around these mines were devastated by the collapse of the mining industry in the 1980s. On the edges of many of these communities there are now \"Industrial Villages\" springing up, helping to replace the jobs lost by the demise of the mining industry, and so helping to keep young people in these communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npt.gov.uk/|title=Neath Port Talbot Council|website=www.npt.gov.uk}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2011}}\n\nA legacy to Neath's political history is the memorial stone in Victoria Gardens to the 5 Neath citizens killed during the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u201338.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe constituency remains a [[Welsh language|Welsh-speaking]] area, with approximately 26% of the population reported as Welsh speakers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|n|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Coalition Liberal/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[John Hugh Edwards]]\n| [[Coalition Liberal]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n| [[William Jenkins (Labour politician)|Sir William Jenkins]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 Neath by-election|1945 by-election]]\n| [[D.

His only trophy with Hibs was the [[2006\u201307 Scottish League Cup]]; in that season he also won the [[SFWA Young Player of the Year]] award. In May 2007 he was transferred to Celtic for a fee of \u00a34.4 million, the highest transfer fee paid between two Scottish clubs.\n\nDuring Brown's time at Celtic, the club has won nine Scottish championships, five Scottish Cups, and six Scottish League Cups. He has captained the club to 8 consecutive championships since 2011\u201312, and successive [[Treble (association football)|trebles]] in 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319. He has been Celtic's captain since February 2010, and has made more European appearances for Celtic than any other player. He has won the [[PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year]] award twice, in 2008\u201309 and 2017\u201318, and the [[SFWA Footballer of the Year|Scottish Footballer of the Year]] award in 2017\u201318.\n\nBrown played for Scotland at [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels before making his [[Scotland national football team|full international]] debut in November 2005, aged 20. He did not play for Scotland again until March 2007, but then became a regular in the squad. He scored his first goal for the senior team on 5 September 2009 in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] win against [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]].

His only trophy with Hibs was the [[2006\u201307 Scottish League Cup]]; in that season he also won the [[SFWA Young Player of the Year]] award. In May 2007 he was transferred to Celtic for a fee of \u00a34.4 million, the highest transfer fee paid between two Scottish clubs.\n\nDuring Brown's time at Celtic, the club has won nine Scottish championships, five Scottish Cups, and six Scottish League Cups. He has captained the club to 8 consecutive championships since 2011\u201312, and successive [[Treble (association football)|trebles]] in 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319. He has been Celtic's captain since February 2010, and has made more European appearances for Celtic than any other player. He has won the [[PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year]] award twice, in 2008\u201309 and 2017\u201318, and the [[SFWA Footballer of the Year|Scottish Footballer of the Year]] award in 2017\u201318.\n\nBrown played for Scotland at [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels before making his [[Scotland national football team|full international]] debut in November 2005, aged 20. He did not play for Scotland again until March 2007, but then became a regular in the squad. He scored his first goal for the senior team on 5 September 2009 in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] win against [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]].

Mature females are {{convert|2.6-4.5|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, and males {{convert|3\u20136|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. They have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ''[[ghara]]'', hence the name \"gharial\". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.The gharial is normally docile but in 2016,it killed a man\n\nThe gharial probably evolved in the northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. Fossil gharial remains were excavated in [[Pliocene]] deposits in the [[Sivalik Hills]] and the [[Narmada River]] valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests. They lay 20\u201395 eggs, and guard the nests and the young that hatch before the onset of the [[monsoon]]. The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow.\n\nThe wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s, and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s.

Gharials were killed by fishermen, hunted for skins, trophies and [[indigenous medicine]], and their eggs collected for consumption. Today, the remaining individuals form several fragmented subpopulations. Hunting is no longer considered a significant threat. However, the wild population declined from an estimated 436 adult gharials in 1997 to fewer than 250 mature individuals in 2006. One reason for this decline is the increased use of [[gill net]]s for fishing in gharial habitat. The other major reason is the loss of riverine habitat as dams, [[barrage (dam)|barrage]]s, irrigation canals and artificial [[wikt:embankment|embankment]]s were built; [[siltation]] and [[sand-mining]] changed river courses; and land near rivers is used for agriculture and grazing by livestock.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nWhen 111 dead gharials were found in the Chambal River between December 2007 and March 2008, it was initially suspected that they had died either because of toxicants or the illegal use of fish nets, in which they became entrapped in and subsequently drowned.<ref name=Nawab_al2013/> Later [[post mortem]] [[Pathology|pathological]] testing of tissue samples revealed high levels of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s such as [[lead]] and [[cadmium]], which, together with stomach [[ulcer]]s and [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]]s reported in most [[necropsies]], were thought to have caused their deaths.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Whitaker, R. |author2=Basu, D. |author3=Huchzermeyer, F. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=Update on gharial mass mortality in National Chambal Sanctuary |journal=Crocodile Specialist Group Newsletter |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=4\u20138 |url=http://www.iucncsg.org/365_docs/attachments/protarea/CSG%20-8d303c03.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe gharial is listed on [[CITES Appendix I]].<ref name=iucn/> In India, it is protected under the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].<ref name=Whitaker07/> In Nepal, it is fully protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973.<ref name=\"maskey94\"/>\n\n=== Reintroduction programmes ===\n[[File:Gharial Crocodiles - Conservation Breeding Center - Kasara - Chitwan National Park - Nepal - 01 (13907486606).jpg|thumb|Gharials in the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center at [[Chitwan National Park]]]]\nSince the late 1970s, the gharial conservation approach was focused on [[reintroduction]].

Mature females are {{convert|2.6-4.5|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, and males {{convert|3\u20136|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. They have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ''[[ghara]]'', hence the name \"gharial\". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.\n\nThe gharial probably evolved in the northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. Fossil gharial remains were excavated in [[Pliocene]] deposits in the [[Sivalik Hills]] and the [[Narmada River]] valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests. They lay 20\u201395 eggs, and guard the nests and the young that hatch before the onset of the [[monsoon]]. The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow.\n\nThe wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s, and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s. Loss of habitat because of [[sand mining]] and conversion to agriculture, depletion of fish resources and detrimental fishing methods continue to threaten the population. It has been listed as [[critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2007.\n\nThe oldest known depictions of the gharial are about 4,000 years old and were found in the [[Indus Valley]]. [[Hindus]] regard it as the vehicle of the river deity [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ga\u1e45g\u0101]]. Local people living near rivers attributed mystical and healing powers to the gharial, and used some of its body parts as ingredients of [[indigenous medicine]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Lacerta gangetica'' was the [[scientific name]] proposed by [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] in 1789.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gmelin, J.

In subsequent years, gharials were also released into five other rivers in the country.<ref name=\"maskey94\"/> In 2016, this center was overcrowded with more than 600 gharials aged between 5 and 12 years, and many were too old to be released.<ref name=Lang2017>{{cite journal |author=Lang, J.
