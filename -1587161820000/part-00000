Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. It resulted, among other government actions, on the Island's government declaring a curfew on March 15.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.

However, ''The Washington Star'' soon apologized for having printed the quotation without verifying its authenticity and, on February 18, 1958, published an article entitled \"Story of a Phony Quotation--A Futile Effort to Pin It Down--'A Racial Program for the 20th Century' Seems to Exist Only in Somebody's Imagination\", which traced the quotation to [[Eustace Mullins]], who claimed to have found it in a Zionist publication in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=NeverSaid>{{cite book |last1= Boller |first1= Paul F. |last2= George |first2= John |year= 1990 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NCOEYJ0q-DUC&pg=PA14 |title= They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |pages= 14\u201316. |ISBN= 978-0-19-506469-8}}</ref><ref name=Hoaxers>{{cite book |last1= Kominsky |first1= Morris |year= 1970 |title= The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars, and Damned Liars |publisher= Branden Press |page= 92 |ISBN= 978-0828312882}}</ref>\n\nOn August 30 of that year, Rep. [[Abraham J. Multer]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] read the ''Star'' article into the ''Congressional Record'' and raised several other points challenging the quotation's authenticity. These included the nonexistence of a [[Communist Party of Great Britain|British Communist party]] in 1912 (it was founded in 1920) and the nonexistence of a British Communist author named Israel Cohen. Although a British Jewish author and Zionist named [[Israel Cohen (Zionist)|Israel Cohen]] did exist in that period, he had no affiliation with Communism nor is there any record of him writing such a work.
